Title: The Weekly Closeout: Michaels rolls out Summerween and Shakira’s beauty brand debuts

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The crafts retailer is releasing Halloween decor earlier than ever, while the pop star’s Isima line will launch at Ulta Beauty. It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week, and what we’re still thinking about. From Janie and Jack’s sweet collection to Blue Moon lip care, here’s our closeout for the week. Time to par-tee with Uber Eats Other people order burrito bowls and fries for delivery. You order cleats and team jerseys. Uber Technologies announced a partnership with Dick’s Sporting Goods and its sister store Golf Galaxy this week. Shoppers can order items like athletic apparel, footwear and golf equipment from the stores via the Uber Eats platform. “We believe that speed and convenience is key to our omnichannel experience, and we’re excited to launch our partnership with Uber Eats as an extension of that philosophy,” Scott Casciato, vice president of omnichannel fulfillment and strategy at Dick’s Sporting Goods, said in a statement. “When those moments arise where new gear is needed, this partnership with Uber Eats extends our capabilities to give our athletes convenient shopping to get the products they need fast and in a way that is convenient for them.” Shakira launches beauty brand Isima Twenty years after “Hips Don’t Lie” was released, pop star Shakira is hoping her hair care won’t either. The artist on Tuesday launched Isima, a beauty brand focused on clinically backed hair products inspired by the Latin community, which becomes available for purchase online Monday. The line, which includes eight products to start, emphasizes scalp, cortex and cuticle health and is meant to tackle the diverse hair types of Latin shoppers. Products range from $32 to $42 and include shampoos, conditioners, oil, serum, a hair mask and a curl perfector. "A big part of my identity has always been my hair. I'm an artist, a performer, a daughter, a mother, and through it all I've had these curls that, believe me, have been through a lot,” the artist, who is Isima’s founder and chief community officer, said in a statement. “I've watched friends, family, and many other women who like me, spent years trying every new product available to find the right one. I have always felt like there are a lot of products out there, but nothing to meet the challenges that come with complex hair and multiple textures." In addition to its own website, Isima will launch exclusively at Ulta Beauty stores nationwide and on that retailer’s website come July 6. Ulta will also showcase the products at its Mexico flagships in August (the retailer announced last year it would expand to that market in 2025). The beauty line is vegan, Leaping Bunny-certified and a part of Ulta’s Conscious Beauty collection. Michaels celebrates Summerween Craft retailer Michaels is launching boo-tiful products earlier than ever and just in time for Summerween — the unofficial June nod to Halloween that continues to grow in popularity. The decor debuts Friday (the 13th!) in stores and rolls out throughout the summer. Collections include Trick or Treat (available Friday), Sweet & Spooky (available Friday), Dead Regency (July 25), Iridescent Moon (July 25) and Alice’s Adventure (Aug.15). "Our customers' passion for Halloween is unmatched, and the incredible enthusiasm for last year's collections made one thing clear: we had to go bigger and bolder than ever before," Chief Merchandising Officer Stacey Shively said in a statement. "This year, we're thrilled to deliver our most expansive and creatively daring Halloween assortment to date.” A lip balm that only comes once in a Blue Moon Ever taken a sip of beer and wished it was lip balm? This summer, it could be. Blue Moon is teaming up with personal care brand Eos to launch a $5 Valencia Orange Lip Balm. The product launched Wednesday and is available on both Eos and Blue Moon’s websites for a limited time. While it doesn’t contain alcohol, the lip balm was “specially crafted for fans 21 and older,” per a company press release. "The Valencia orange is more than a garnish. It's a core part of our identity and what makes a Blue Moon a Blue Moon," Courtney Benedict, vice president of marketing at Above Premium Beer at Molson Coors Beverage Company, said in a statement. "Through this unexpected partnership with Eos, we're giving fans a whole new way to enjoy that iconic citrus taste – no Valencia orange required. It's a fun, fresh take on what it means to brighten your summer with Blue Moon." And it’ll save shoppers a few calories too. Happy lip smacking! A sweet collection for kids Janie and Jack introduced a 25-piece collection with Milk Bar featuring looks inspired by the dessert shop’s signature treats. Items in the collection range from $18.50 to $79 in sizes up to 12. It's now available on Janie and Jack’s website and enters stores nationwide on Monday. "We believe childhood should be sweet—and this Milk Bar collection brings that to life in the most joyful way," Parnell Eagle, president of Janie and Jack, said in a statement. $1.75B That’s the amount of convertible senior notes Gamestop on Wednesday announced as a proposed private offering. The retailer also intends to grant initial note purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of notes. Gamestop said it intends to use net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. This includes making investments consistent with GameStop’s investment policy and potential acquisitions. The zero-interest notes will mature in 2032 and are convertible into either cash, company stock or a combination of cash and stock. 8.1% That’s the projected drop in port volumes for May, measured in twenty-foot equivalent units or TEU, the first year-on-year decline since September 2023. The estimated volume, at 1.91 million TEU, would be the lowest since December 2023, according to the Global Port Tracker from the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates. The decline is largely due to tariffs instituted in April, notably a 145% levy on goods from China that has since been lowered to 30%. Tariffs may go lower still following recent trade negotiations, though the situation remains in flux. Retailers are entering their busiest time of year, with inventory needed for the back-to-school and holiday seasons, so volumes are likely to pick up, though import duties remain a concern, NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said in a statement. “Retailers had paused their purchases and imports previously because of the significantly high tariffs,” Gold said. “They are now looking to get those orders and cargo moving in order to bring as much merchandise into the country as they can before the reciprocal tariff and additional China tariff pauses end in July and August.” U.S. immigration policy erodes normally robust spending by Hispanic consumers Some retailers and brands enjoying the robust spending power of Hispanic consumers have noticed a pullback in the past several months, and the companies, along with some analysts, are pointing to current U.S. immigration policy. Executives have called out slowing growth due to a pullback from Latino consumers, according to a Wall Street Journal report this week. In March, several analysts warned that U.S. immigration policy is restraining Hispanic shoppers’ spending and dragging down off-price stores. Immigration policy presents challenges to the U.S. economy broadly and retailers in particular in a few ways, including weaker population growth, a tighter labor supply and disruption from fears of deportation, Wells Fargo analysts said earlier this year. The Trump administration stepped up raids in recent days, sparking protests in Los Angeles and other major cities. These households aren’t necessarily more financially challenged than others. Nearly 60% “reported positive sentiment about their ability to afford everyday essentials, the highest level since 2021,” plus this group has higher savings and more discretionary income than others, according to Kantar’s ShopperScape tracker. Yet Hispanic consumers started the year avoiding stores, with the steepest declines at supermarkets and dollar stores, Kantar said. For the first time in two years, demand from this cohort is weaker than others, according to an April report from Circana, which lists “immigration concerns” among the factors.

Title: Job search going nowhere? Try this.

If you're trying to find a job, it's time to get scrappy. While the job market hasn't fallen off a cliff and layoffs remain low, stiffer competition for roles, surging use of artificial intelligence, and some employers' hesitation to hire are scrambling some job searches. That means some job seekers might have to pivot — potentially to an entirely new industry — or find other ways to stand out if they're set on a certain field. In some cases, you might have to adjust your goals. "Maybe put aside for the moment that dream to work for Amazon and Google, and maybe think about a different company that's more mid-cap," Angie Kamath, dean of the School of Professional Studies at New York University, told Business Insider. Kamath said the need to stay open to various options if you're looking for a role reflects the rapid change in many industries, especially as employers and employees alike try to understand what AI will mean for many aspects of work. "That's here to stay," she said, referring to the need for job seekers to understand how technology might remake jobs. To keep up, Kamath said, you should find ways to build your skills. That doesn't only mean getting a degree in a field, she said. Kamath said you might look to freebie or low-cost classes, for example, on AI from Amazon, Google, or online learning platforms like Udemy. "That's my No. 1 advice. Try something out. See if you like it. See if you hate it. See if you're energized by it," she said. If you don't want to shift to a different field or job type, you might simply have to work harder to stand out. Ryan McManus, a vice president at the recruitment firm Selby Jennings, told BI that some employers have become more selective in who they hire. "It might just be a bit more competitive in the sense that we're looking to check more boxes," he said, referring to finding candidates for the company's employer clients. For those who don't necessarily have every part of a job description nailed down, intangibles like being personable and a strong communicator can make a difference, McManus said. While finding ways to be flexible and try to stand out in a job search can help, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be easy to land a role. Some employers are slow-walking hiring, and some workers' confidence about business prospects is slipping. In the Glassdoor Employee Confidence Index released Tuesday, the share of employees who expect a positive six-month business outlook fell to 44.1% in May from 45.8% in April. The May reading was the lowest since 2016, when Glassdoor began collecting predictions from tens of thousands of US workers. To navigate an uncertain landscape, NYU's Kamath said job seekers might think of themselves as entrepreneurs who generate more than one idea for a business. "That's what we should do as we're looking for jobs. We should come up with a couple of versions of success, or what's interesting," she said. To know which option might be best, Kamath said it can help to ask friends what they think. She said that might mean having a conversation with a connection on LinkedIn who's in the line of work you're considering. Or it could involve visiting an employer that has public events or conferences. That manner of thinking, Kamath said, helps you avoid putting much pressure on yourself to land a certain role, and the thinking that "anything other than being successful in that one path equals failure." "It widens out what you might do and where you might do it," she said. Ultimately, Kamath said, job seekers often benefit when they step back and consider alternatives. "That's been very eye-opening for our students and our alumni to say there's more out there than the singular path to success," she said.

Title: Meta Invests $14.3 Billion in Scale AI as Zuckerberg Builds New Artificial Intelligence Team

Scale CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang will lead Meta’s new “Superintelligence” division following the deal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that his company will be investing heavily in artificial intelligence in 2025. And on Thursday, he put his money where his mouth is, with the parent company of Facebook and Instagram investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI, a company that offers a platform and training data for developing AI models. The investment values Scale AI at more than $29 billion, the San Francisco-based company said in a blog post. As part of the deal, 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, Scale’s chief executive and co-founder, will join Meta to spearhead its new AI research division now dubbed the “Superintelligence” lab. Meta’s stock was down 0.77% on Friday, the morning after the deal was officially announced, to $688 per share. The company’s stock price is up about 15% since the start of the year. The tech giant’s stake in Scale AI — its second-largest deal ever, after the $19 billion it spent to buy WhatsApp in 2014 — reinforces Zuckerberg’s claim that AI is a key focus for Meta moving forward. Zuckerberg in January said Meta would spend between $60 billion and $65 billion to “significantly” expand its AI team; the company then updated that projection during its first quarter earnings call in April, saying it planned on spending up to $72 billion this year on AI. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said in January. “I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we’ll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.” The new superintelligence division will be separate from Reality Labs, Meta’s division that has been focused on virtual reality, augmented reality and AI. That division has stood out as one sector where Meta is spending more than it is making; the company reported it lost $4.21 billion on Reality Labs during the first quarter, while Meta overall reported $42.31 billion in sales.

BySchaeffer's Investment Research BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) has had a busy month. The semiconductor company cleared the $1 trillion market cap level on the way to a record high of $265.43 on June 4. One day later though, AVGO gapped lower by 5%, after the company’s fiscal-year revenue forecast fell short of estimates. The shares have battled back since then, poised to add 1.2% this week and remain a chip-shot from that peak. The good news is that Broadcom stock is flashing a historically bullish combination. The stock’s recent peak comes amid historically low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for the equity in the past. According to data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight different times in the past five years when AVGO was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile of its annual range or lower -- as is the case with the security’s current SVI of 32%, which sits in the bottom percentile of its 12-month range. Data shows Broadcom stock was higher a month later 75% of the time, averaging a 3% return for that time period. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would put AVGO just $264, within striking distance of that record high. Keep an eye on the $250 level, which could step up as support should it get cleared today. This area was home to peaks in December and January. In the shorter term, a cushion could come from AVGO’s ascending 20-day moving average, a trendline that caught the post-earnings bear gap last week and hasn’t been breached on a closing basis since April, per the chart below. AVGO Stock Chart With 20-Day Moving Average Puts have been much more popular than usual in the options pits. Broadcom’s 50-day put/call volume ratio of 0.59 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) ranks higher than 91% of readings from the past year. So while calls still outflank puts on an absolute basis, the high percentile suggests the ratio is on an uptick that nears an annual high rate. Options are an intriguing route. The equity’s Schaeffer’s Volatility Scorecard (SVS) ranks high at 84 out of 100, meaning AVGO has tended to exceed these expectations during the past year -- a boon for options buyers.

Title: Bitcoin At $1 Million? CEO Says It’s The Price To Beat Gold
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-at-1-million-novogratz-says-its-the-price-to-beat-gold/
Time Published: 2025-06-13T15:00:30Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to CNBC’s Power Lunch, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin could climb all the way to $1 million per coin if big institutions keep piling in. The cryptocurrency hit a weekly peak of $110,290 on Tuesday. It slipped 4.5% to $104,300 by Thursday, but it’s still climbed 1.75% over the past seven days. Novogratz says this isn’t just hype. He points to firms moving cash from dollars and gold into crypto. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went live in January 2024 after SEC approval. Based on reports, that fund now gives big investors a straightforward path to own Bitcoin without buying coins directly. BlackRock manages about $11.6 trillion in assets. When a player that size steps in, others notice. Novogratz says wealth managers and pension funds have started treating Bitcoin like a macro asset, on par with gold and the S&P 500. Treasury companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to follow suit. Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright. According to filings, Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop, and US President Donald Trump’s Media arm all announced major purchases this year. Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1–2% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn’t guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today’s $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin’s price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn’t impossible, but it won’t happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin’s march toward gold’s market cap as a “ball rolling down a hill.” He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Gold, long considered a safe haven, beckoned investors seeking safety from the escalating Middle East conflict. Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, instead joined the exodus of risk assets. "The traditional buyers of gold are not in the crypto market yet,” Stephen Wundke, director of strategy and revenue at quantitative digital asset investment firm Algoz, told Decrypt. He added that gold buyers are “risk-off investors who will return to the safe haven that is gold, as they see it, whenever there is potential conflict." Though gold is up over 2% on the day, Wundke thinks this is "hardly a rush to cover," adding that Bitcoin, for one, had been falling "well before there was any news of the strike on Iran." Data from CoinGecko show that the price of Bitcoin plunged 3.6% to $103,900 Friday morning as initial reports that Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities came in. At the same time, gold leapt to $3,427.90 per ounce, showing how the two assets diverge during a geopolitical crisis. It is up 7% in the past month and more than 46% year-to-date, data from Trading Economics indicate. "Bitcoin is sometimes seen as a safe haven, but in reality, it often moves in line with tech stocks rather than gold," Jay Jo, senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt. "Because of this coupling, Bitcoin and gold can show opposite price trends during geopolitical crises." While the smoke hasn't settled, altcoins including Ethereum, XRP, and Solana tapped over $1 billion in liquidations, most of which are in long positions. Meanwhile, traditional safe havens, including gold, the U.S. dollar, and government bonds, attracted flight-to-safety flows as investors dumped risk assets. "Fundamentals are more at play with BTC than problems in the Middle East, at the moment," Wundke noted, adding that June is "traditionally a quiet month for BTC" and that the market appears to be "in a consolidation phase." Still, Wundke argued that if "any significant escalation in the Middle East" occurs, it might affect Bitcoin and send it breaking below $100,000. Sentiment has slipped over the past day; although the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 61, indicating greed, it's down 10 points on the day—and over 81% of predictors on Myriad expect it to hold below 64 through the end of the week. (Disclaimer: decentralized on-chain prediction market Myriad was launched by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN) Bitcoin's younger, more leverage-prone investor base might have contributed to the selloff intensity, with some noting that a shift is underway. "The bull case becomes [that] over time, young people care about it more than old people," Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz claimed in a CNBC interview Friday. Gold "slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin" as the alpha crypto has increasingly become an institutionalized "macro asset," he added. Citing weighted demand from financial institutions such as BlackRock, Novogratz said that interest in Bitcoin as a macro-asset could be likened to "a ball rolling downhill."

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 08: In this photo illustration, the logo of Adobe Inc. is displayed on a ... More smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on June 08, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently revealed its Q2 results (fiscal year ending in November), exceeding analyst expectations. The firm reported earnings of $5.06 per share on revenues of $5.9 billion, surpassing the consensus estimates of $4.97 per share and $5.8 billion, respectively. Moreover, Adobe raised its full-year guidance. Despite these encouraging results, the stock experienced a modest reaction in after-hours trading, falling by 1%. This response, or lack of it, calls for a deeper analysis of the company’s financial performance and its present stock valuation. If you seek an upside with a more stable experience than individual stocks, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, achieving over 91% returns since inception. In a different context, check out – Boeing Stock Faces Fresh Crisis After 787 Dreamliner Crash. Adobe's revenue rose by 11% year-over-year, totaling $5.87 billion in Q2 (fiscal year ending in November). This increase was fueled by its main segments: Adobe is presently benefitting from clients transitioning to its premium subscription plans, which are generating a stable revenue flow. Adobe's Firefly, an innovative AI tool that allows users to create, modify, and enhance images and videos through simple text commands, has broadened Adobe's suite of AI-driven creative tools, aimed at accelerating the ideation and content creation processes. Furthermore, Adobe recently announced that it is incorporating image-generation AI models from OpenAI and Google directly into the Firefly application, further enhancing its capabilities. Adobe's adjusted operating margin of 45.5% in Q2'25 was slightly lower than the 46% figure reported in the same quarter last year. The company also repurchased 8.6 million shares during the quarter. Increased revenues, a small drop in operating margins, and a reduced number of shares outstanding led to the company reporting a bottom line of $5.06 compared to $4.48 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, Adobe has revised its full-year revenue forecast to a range between $23.5 billion and $23.6 billion, an increase from the previous estimate of $23.3 billion to $23.55 billion. The firm also expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $20.50 to $20.70, up from the earlier estimate of $20.20 to $20.50. ADBE stock has declined 6% this year, trailing behind the broader indices, with the S&P 500 index up 3%. Overall, ADBE stock has shown considerable volatility compared to the index over recent years. The stock's returns were 13% in 2021, -41% in 2022, 77% in 2023, and -25% in 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500's returns were 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 23% in 2024 — indicating that ADBE underperformed the S&P in 2021, 2022, and 2024. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has effectively outperformed the S&P 500 during the last four-year span. Why is this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded superior returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index, providing a less turbulent experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current unpredictable macroeconomic landscape, amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions, could ADBE encounter a situation akin to those in 2021, 2022, and 2024, resulting in underperformance relative to the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it bounce back? While we will soon refresh our model to incorporate the latest results and guidance for ADBE, the stock appears undervalued. At its current price of $410, ADBE stock is trading at 20x the anticipated adjusted earnings of $20.35, based on the mid-point of the provided guidance, compared to the stock's average P/E ratio of 25x over the past three years. In fact, we currently estimate Adobe's Valuation to be $550 per share, indicating more than 30% upside potential from current levels. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge potential risks. Investors may moderate their valuation of Adobe due to a slower-than-expected pace of growth driven by AI. Furthermore, the stock has historically lagged behind the S&P 500 during recent market downturns, as outlined in our “Buy or Sell Adobe Stock” dashboard. Therefore, investors should cautiously consider these risks before investing in Adobe stock. While ADBE stock seems to have the potential for growth, it is beneficial to examine how Adobe's Peers perform on relevant metrics.

ByAlex Knapp ByAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of The Prototype, we look at a big space stock IPO, Korea’s plan to dominate the world of robots, building electric motors without metal and more. You can sign up to get The Prototype in your inbox here. Dylan Taylor, chairman and CEO of Voyager Technologies Inc. Space company Voyager Technologies brought in nearly $383 million in its IPO on Wednesday, with shares priced at $31. The company offers a number of different space services for both governments and commercial customers, including services on board the International Space Station. Its stock price soared upon the opening of trading, hitting a sky-high $63.88 at one point on Wednesday. It’s since come back down to Earth a bit, closing at $49.70 yesterday, giving it a market cap of over $2.7 billion. The company plans to use the increased capital to expand a number of its offerings, particularly Starlab, a private space station the company is developing for use after the International Space Station is decommissioned. Investors hope this success might lead to more IPOs in the space sector this year. P.S. - Quick housekeeping note: There will be no edition of the Prototype next week, as I will be off for the holiday. See you all back here on the 27th! Joe Buglewicz/AP In 2021 Hyundai Motor Company paid $1.1 billion to acquire 80% of robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, famous for videos of its dog-shaped bot named Spot and its running and jumping humanoid Atlas. The deal initially seemed more of a headline grab for Hyundai rather than part of a fully baked strategy. That’s no longer the case. Four years later, Hyundai now represents the tip of the spear in Korea Inc.’s thrust into robotics. The company has continued to develop Spot, especially for use as a roving site inspector, and is also iterating on Atlas, with the intention of selling mass-produced humanoids controlled by AI as soon as 2028. Hyundai’s robotics lab has already deployed its X-ble platform of wearable robotic exoskeletons for use in factories. X-ble Shoulder, launched late last year after trials with 300 workers, is said to reduce shoulder and deltoid muscle exertions by more than 30% when lifting heavy objects like car parts. Its X-ble MEX is a more complicated rehabilitation suit that can help people walk again. Incredibly, these X-ble exoskeletons don’t require an outside power source, instead using passive spring-torque mechanics. Industrial robots are nothing new to Korea, which already leads the world in density of robot deployment, with 1,000 bots per 10,000 factory workers, compared to about 300 in the U.S. and 470 in China. But now its industries and government see a massive opportunity for robots outside the factory. A new public-private partnership, the K-Humanoid Alliance, aims to offer a commercially viable bipedal bot by 2028 that weighs less than 130 pounds, can lift 40 pounds, walk about 3 yards per second and can move with the flexibility enabled by more than 50 joints. The K-Humanoid Alliance also seeks to develop a common AI “brain” that all Korean robots can use. Read the whole story at Forbes. A team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology has invented an electric motor that doesn’t use any metal. Instead, its main electric components are made from carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are lighter than metals but just as electrically conductive. Use of this material has been proposed in the past, but has been hampered by the fact that making CNTs involves metals, and the residue left behind ends up degrading electrical performance. The researchers figured out a way to remove those metal particles with a chemical process that didn’t disrupt the CNT’s structure. The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft has sent back the first clear images of the sun’s south pole. The unique views of the sun were captured on March 16-17, when the Solar Orbiter was orbiting the sun from 15 degrees below the solar equator, enabling this first look. The spacecraft’s three cameras provide images of the sun in visible light, ultraviolet light, and light emanating from different temperatures of charged gas above the sun’s surface, revealing distinct layers of the sun’s atmosphere. In my other newsletter, InnovationRx, Amy Feldman and I wrote about RFK Jr.’s vaccine advisory committee purge, a tech billionaire’s funding of research on AI and healthcare, FDA approval of a new medicine that prevents RSV in infants and digital health company Omada’s IPO. On the Forbes YouTube channel, I spoke with my colleague Brittany Lewis about the potential science impacts of the Trump Administration’s proposed budget cuts to NASA as well as the potential consequences of HHS Secretary Kennedy firing all members of a key vaccine advisory committee. Researchers developed a new kind of paint that can passively cool buildings. It does this in two ways. First, its color reflects sunlight, which is a well-known technique. But it also incorporates nanoparticles that make the paint more porous, so that it captures more water when it’s wet. When that water evaporates, it cools down the building, working the same way sweat does to cool down your body. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope took new photos of Uranus, giving scientists new insights about the seventh planet. One surprise: Its magnetic field doesn’t interact with its moons. IBM is aiming to have the first practical quantum computer built by 2028. It will comprise modular units each containing quantum chipsets, and the company says it has figured out scalable error correction, one of the major issues holding quantum computing back. Satellite company Kymeta developed a single antenna that can communicate across multiple satellite frequency bands. Until now, a satellite had to be outfitted with multiple antennas to do this, so this could lay a foundation for more seamless satellite communications. A gene therapy for hemophilia is still safe and effective, over a decade after it is first administered. A new study found that 10 patients who received it between 2010 and 2012 still showed the benefits of their one-time treatment, with few side effects. An analysis of over 3,500 companies across Europe over a span of 20 years found that firms that are newly-listed on the stock market will see a quick boost of profit compared to private companies that abandon their plans to IPO. The researchers also found that those companies see an increase in sales per employee and greater market expansion following going public as well. “Going public may unlock growth potential, provided market conditions are favourable,” researcher Francisco Urzua said in a press release about the study. The great rock musician Brian Wilson passed away earlier this week at the age of 82. To commemorate his legacy, Rolling Stone enshrined 25 of his essential songs, and I can’t quibble with any of their picks. My own personal top five: “God Only Knows”, “I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times”, “Good Vibrations”, “Wouldn’t It Be Nice?” and the utterly transcendent “Love And Mercy.” He may be gone now, but he’s left behind an incredible catalog of music.

Title: Forbes Daily: Israel Strikes Iran As Trump Pushes For A Nuclear Deal

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump has touted his $5 million “Gold Card” visa as a way to raise trillions of dollars for the U.S. But a new website launching the initiative doesn’t look or feel like a legitimate government site, experts say. Among the red flags are the URL itself, unexpected links to the Department of Commerce rather than Homeland Security, and no disclaimer regarding usage of personal data. “This is a joke,” says immigration and investing expert Nuri Katz. “[The Trump Administration] is asking very wealthy individuals to trust a one-page website that feels like it was created in five minutes by a teenager in his bedroom.” And while Trump told his social media followers that the waitlist for the Gold Card was open, it could take years for applications to be processed. Congress has yet to initiate any changes to immigration and tax law that the program would require. AP Photo/Vahid Salemi Israel launched a series of major military strikes against Iran and its nuclear program late on Thursday, killing several top military officials and nuclear scientists in the country, a move that U.S. officials said was a “unilateral” action by Israel as they denied any involvement by U.S. forces. President Donald Trump urged Iran to make a nuclear deal or face “more brutal” attacks in the future. Global crude oil prices jumped sharply, while U.S. stock futures fell early Friday in the wake of the strikes, which marked a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East. A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Donald Trump must return control of the California National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles back to the state’s Governor Gavin Newsom, but an appeals court later temporarily blocked the judge’s order. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, which was done without Newsom’s approval, was illegal, “exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.” Shares of Boeing fell 5% Thursday after a plane operated by Air India crashed shortly following takeoff, killing more than 260 people aboard as well as others on the ground, and adding to the safety concerns that the airplane maker has faced for years. Boeing said it was in contact with Air India, and the aircraft involved with the crash was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner delivered to Air India in 2014. Digital bank Chime’s stock popped in its debut on the Nasdaq Thursday, rising 37% and bringing its valuation to $16 billion, the latest successful IPO in recent weeks. The 13-year-old bank grew rapidly during the pandemic, and while it maintained that expansion, it spent heavily to get there—making it critical for Chime to find cheaper ways to attract and retain customers. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison overtook Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to become the second-richest person in the world Thursday, as shares of his cloud computing giant surged amid the AI arms race. Ellison enjoyed the largest daily fortune boost of any billionaire, with his net worth climbing by $25 billion to $242 billion, second only behind his longtime friend Elon Musk. Two long-tenured partners at Y Combinator, which has incubated some of the most successful companies in Silicon Valley—from Airbnb to Dropbox—are leaving the firm to start their own fund, Forbes has learned. While the size of the fund, intended to nurture early stage companies, hasn’t been announced, one source said it will be substantially north of $250 million. Major platforms like Google Cloud and Spotify experienced technical issues on Thursday amid a widespread internet outage, though social media platforms appeared to be largely spared. Cloudflare, which serves tens of millions of web requests per second, said in the afternoon that a number of services suffering “intermittent failures” were being investigated, but later in the day, said services were fully restored. Despite his real estate empire, a majority of President Donald Trump’s fortune—$3.3 billion of his total $5.5 billion—is now tied to crypto, which the president has tapped for cash and worked to promote. The latest shift was when Trump Media and Technology Group purchased crypto to bolster its balance sheet, transforming Trump’s company from a social-media play to a Bitcoin bet. FBI officers physically removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday as he attempted to shout questions at Noem, an incident that drew bipartisan backlash. Noem falsely claimed in a Fox News interview after the incident that Padilla “started launching towards the podium” and “did not identify himself.” Megan Briggs/Getty Images When Lionel Messi laces up his cleats to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup that begins Saturday, the Argentine soccer superstar will be the highest-paid player there, with $135 million in estimated earnings over the past 12 months. He’ll be joined by other top earners like Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappé and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, a confluence of top-earning talent that is a direct result of FIFA’s new format for the tournament. The FAA is investigating a JetBlue flight that skidded off the runway at Boston Logan International Airport, and the airport was under a ground delay Thursday afternoon. The carrier said no one was injured in the incident, which occurred on a flight that originated from Chicago O’Hare International Airport. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Scale AI’s shocking $15 billion deal to sell a 49% stake to Meta has raised the specter that the startup’s $14 billion-valued data labeling business could implode. At play is the concern that Scale, which has been the dominant player in labeling data to help major tech companies and AI startups train their models, could share details about the types of data that leading AI players have used to build their most cutting edge tech with Meta. OpenAI, one of its most prominent customers, has already been winding down its work with Scale, according to four sources with knowledge of its business. Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne denied that OpenAI has pulled back its spending. Scale built its business on the back of a massive clickworker army, largely of workers based overseas who would teach AI models by providing context for masses of data. But this kind of work has become a commodity. “Anyone who puts up a team can compete with you, and it comes down to price really quickly,” said Kevin Guo, cofounder of a startup that got out of the data labeling business, in a 2023 interview. WHY IT MATTERS Access to high quality human data is crucial for training powerful AI models, so much so that data has been considered a moat for AI juggernauts like OpenAI and Anthropic in the AI race. Scale AI, which booked $870 million in revenue in 2024, captured the data labeling market early by supplying troves of human-labeled data to companies like Cohere, OpenAI and Microsoft. But Meta owning almost half of Scale would change that equation. MORE How Alexandr Wang Turned An Army Of Clickworkers Into A $7.3 Billion AI Unicorn The House voted to claw back funding from NPR and PBS, in a move known as rescission, as the White House has sought to slash their funding. The legislation will also be considered in the Senate: $9.4 billion: The total amount of the cuts the White House has proposed, including $8.3 billion in funding for USAID September 2027: The date the funds had previously been approved through 15%: The share of PBS’ budget that comes from the federal government Today’s job market is especially tough for entry-level roles, and AI could eliminate up to half of entry-level knowledge work in the next five years, according to Anthropic’s CEO. But rest assured that AI can’t automate creativity and human insight—abilities that haven’t been emphasized in formal training lately. It’s critical for young people to develop skills like storytelling, creative thinking and empathy, and focus on the humanities as core career infrastructure.

Title: Bitcoin To Replace Gold As Store Of Value And Hit $1 Million, Predicts Mike Novogratz

Former Goldman Sachs partner and Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz remains one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls in finance. Novogratz has now joined the $1 million per Bitcoin (BTC) bandwagon, suggesting that the OG cryptocurrency could 10X and break that milestone if it continues to grow in popularity and surpass gold. Appearing on CNBC’s Power Lunch on Thursday, Mike Novogratz said he foresees a seven-figure moonshot for the premier cryptocurrency. Novogratz’s main rationale for anticipating Bitcoin’s potential 1,000% growth is based on the crypto’s increasing institutional adoption as a macro asset. “Now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there’s easier ways to get it,” he quipped. “So the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling down hill.” BlackRock is perhaps the most notable example of institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset. The $11 trillion asset manager’s spot BTC exchange-traded fund has amassed approximately 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply for its clients since going live in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust currently holds more than $70 billion in assets under management. Novogratz further suggested that the increasing adoption will ensure Bitcoin catches up with gold. According to the pundit, younger investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the supply-capped digital asset replacing the yellow metal over time: “If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go, 10x, and so that’s [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” Novogratz is not the first Bitcoin bull to predict that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly in value over the long term. In April, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest raised its bull-case Bitcoin price projection to $2.4 million by 2030, up from a previous projection of $1.5 million. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said last month that BTC could break $1 million by 2028, thanks to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has also, on multiple occasions, shared his thoughts on how high he thinks the price of Bitcoin could rocket to.

Title: BlackRock’s ‘bold, but doable’ targets reflect a changing asset manager

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. From their Manhattan headquarters on Thursday, top BlackRock leaders—including Chief Executive Larry Fink, who had just flown back to New York after a trip to the Middle East—lined up to discuss their business with investors and analysts over five hours of presentations. The goal: to show why they think BlackRock is a stock worth owning. They were gathered for the company’s investor day, complete with 147 slides packed with fresh five-year financial targets for fund-raising, revenue, and more. The firm’s last investor day was in 2023. BlackRock has ambitious goals. Over the next five years, the company aims to roughly double its operating income to $15 billion, double its market capitalization to $280 billion, and increase revenue, which in 2024 totaled $20 billion, by 75% to $35 billion. It’s targeting organic base fee growth of at least 5%, and an operating margin of at least 45%, “through the market cycle." Private markets will be a big part of BlackRock’s growth. The world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion of assets, is now targeting $400 billion of private markets fund-raising by 2030 as it aims for technology and private markets businesses to contribute at least 30% of overall revenue by that year. That’s up from a 15% slice in 2024. “Bold, but doable ambitions," said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. BlackRock’s fresh targets sets new stakes for the performance expected from the $28 billion of private markets acquisitions it’s carried out in the past year. They paint a picture of an asset manager betting its future on private markets after making its name in the public markets with fixed income and exchange-traded funds. “We’re not reliant on any one strategy or asset class," said Martin Small, BlackRock’s chief financial officer and head of corporate strategy, in prepared remarks. “All of our businesses have delivered organic base fee growth over the last five years. That said, the BlackRock of the next five years, to 2030, is different than the past." Trading at 24 times earnings, investors assign BlackRock’s stock a lower multiple than shares of pure private markets players Blackstone and KKR, which trade at 42 times and 54 times earnings, respectively. Investors could start to view BlackRock’s stock as a play for exposure to assets such as private credit and infrastructure, not just its best-known products in the public markets like exchange-traded funds. “Are we in direct competition with Blackstone? I would say, in their two core businesses, no. But in other areas of private [assets], where we have deemed we have an incredible opportunity, [yes]," Fink said in an interview with Barron’s in March. He added at the time: “I have no intention of going into private equity" with any large-scale acquisition. “I have no intention of being huge in real estate." For now, investors seemed underwhelmed by what they heard Thursday. Shares of BlackRock fell 0.4% while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. That slide is typical of the firm’s investor days. In 2018, 2021, and 2023—the past three such events held by the firm—the stock fell 1.1%, 0.4%, and 0.5% before recovering those losses the following session, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Opt for AI companies using their competitive advantages to establish leadership positions in big ... More markets. Nvidia was one of the first companies to monetize the AI revolution, but it will not be the last. As AI innovation reshapes business processes, there is ample room for AI software, service and hardware providers to generate meaningful value and wealth — for customers and investors. Identifying which stocks will rise to prominence is the AI investor's big challenge. Below are six strong contenders that are worth a deeper dive. Based on market opportunity, projected results and competitive positioning, one or more of these six AI stocks may be the future star of your growth portfolio: A review of each company follows. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. Upstart Holdings operates an AI-powered lending marketplace that overhauls the traditional credit-scoring model. The company’s streamlined, all-digital loan applications identify more creditworthy borrowers, improves access to affordable debt and lowers costs for lenders. According to Upstart data, its technology approves 43% more applicants at 33% lower APRs. Upstart quantifies the global credit market at over $25 trillion, with $1 trillion available to origination and servicing platforms. Upstart generated 2024 revenue of $637 million and recorded a net loss of $137 million. In 2025, the company expects $1 billion in revenue and a net loss of $80 million. Per stockanalysis.com, analysts expect the company to generate positive EPS of $1.49 in 2025, rising to over $4.50 by 2029. Upstart stock trades for about $57 per share and is up 138% over the past year. Snowflake operates a cloud-based data warehouse and a platform to access the data for AI and other applications, analytics and collaboration. A Contino review says Snowflake’s platform "enables data storage, processing, and analytic solutions that are faster, easier to use, and far more flexible than traditional offerings." According to Snowflake’s 2025 Investor Day presentation, the company expects its market opportunity to reach $355 billion by calendar year 2029. That's more than double the estimated market size of $170 billion in 2024. Snowflake serves a diverse customer group that includes meal kit company Hello Fresh, German automaker BMW Group and transportation services provider Penske. Customers use Snowflake to support a range of objectives, from cost efficiency to improved customer experiences. In fiscal 2025, Snowflake generated $3.4 billion in revenue and recorded a GAAP operating loss of $1.4 billion. The company expects first-quarter 2026 revenue growth of 21% to 22% with an operating margin of 5%. Analysts expect Snowflake to reach $10 billion in revenue and EPS over $4 in fiscal 2030, according to stockanalysis.com. Snowflake stock trades for about $212 per share and is up 70% over the past year. CrowdStrike operates a cybersecurity solution called Falcon that uses AI to detect and block malware and other digital threats. The company recently announced the release of a new agentic AI with autonomous reasoning and investigative capabilities for faster threat mitigation. CrowdStrike serves more than 70% of Fortune 100 companies and 18 of the top 20 U.S. banks, according to a 2024 investor presentation. The company values the AI-native security platform market at $116 billion. In fiscal 2025, CrowdStrike produced revenue of $3.95 billion and a GAAP operating loss of $120 million. Analysts expect the company to eclipse $10 billion in revenue and $8 in EPS in fiscal 2030, according to stockanalysis.com. CrowdStrike stock trades for about $486 per share and has gained 28% over the past year. The gain is despite a steep stock-price decline last summer, following a failed update that crashed more than 8.5 million systems. Ambarella designs and sells low-power vision processors for use in edge AI applications such as autonomous driving systems, drive recorders, vehicle safety features, surveillance systems and more. Edge AI applications process data locally, rather than sending data to the cloud for processing. As a result, they can produce faster responses with lower power consumption. Power efficiency is a focus for Ambarella—the company says its chips deliver the same or better results while being up to five times more efficient than competitor solutions. A research report from S&S Insider values the edge AI chips market at $21.4 billion in 2024 and projects a CAGR of 33.93% from 2025 to 2032. That translates to a 2032 edge AI chip market worth $221.5 billion. For fiscal 2025, Ambarella reported $284.9 million in revenue and a GAAP net loss of $117 million. Analysts expect the company’s revenue to surpass $500 million and EPS to approach $1.50 in fiscal 2029, according to stockanalysis.com. AMBA stock trades for about $54 and is down 2% over the last year. Arm Holdings designs high-performance, energy-efficient CPUs and GPUs, and then licenses the architecture. Licensees customize Arm designs to suit their applications. According to Arm, its technology is trusted and tested by more than 22 million software developers globally. Arm partners include Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Mercedes-Benz and Fujitsu. Arm’s foundational role in chipmaking expedites innovation and time-to-market while lowering hardware acquisition costs for data centers. Prior to its 2023 U.S. IPO, Arm estimated its total addressable market (TAM) was $202.5 billion. The company also projected that its TAM would grow to $246.6 billion by December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2025, Arm reported revenue of $4 billion and diluted EPS of $0.75. Analysts expect the company will produce revenue of $9.8 billion and EPS of $3.95 in fiscal 2030, per stockanalysis.com. ARM stock trades for about $139 per share and is down 8.4% over the past year. The Trade Desk runs an ad-buying platform that offers highly targeted and global audiences across multiple digital channels, including smart TVs. The company uses AI to analyze millions of ad opportunities each second to identify the most valuable and cost-efficient placements. According to company data, the Trade Desk’s AI can increase advertiser reach by three times and reduce cost-per-action by 34%. Current customers include McDonald’s, Ikea, New York Post, Audi and Kellogg's. The total addressable global advertising market is nearing $1 trillion, according to The Trade Desk’s first quarter 2025 investor presentation. In 2024, The Trade Desk delivered revenue of $2.4 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.78. Analysts expect the company to double its revenue to $5.9 billion and more than quintuple its EPS to $4.42 in 2029, according to stockanalysis.com. TTD stock trades for about $71 per share, after a 26% decline over the past year. Bottom Line The AI revolution is still in its infancy, which means disciplined investments today could pay off handsomely over the next three to five years. Opt for companies using their competitive advantages to establish leadership positions in big markets. From there, be patient, but also ready to adjust your portfolio as this industry evolves.

George Sivulka — the 27-year-old founder and CEO of AI platform Hebbia — is supplying artificial intelligence to those with more information than time, and millions, if not billions, on the line. Since starting the company in 2020, his client list has grown to include BlackRock, KKR, the U.S. Air Force, Centerview Partners, MetLife, Gunderson Dettmer, Oak Hill and TowerBrook, among others. “The CEOs that get to the [top of these firms] know that innovation could either [elevate] their companies to even bigger levels or completely disrupt their market position,” Sivulka told NYNext. “And so, we’re partnering at the board level for massive transformational projects … really help[ing] them think through how they’re going to [embrace] change.” While popular AI applications such as ChatGPT are largely transactional — a user issues a prompt, the model responds and then the conversation ends — Hebbia’s models are tailor-made, persistent, process-oriented and evolve through repeated use. Agents — autonomous AI programs trained to mirror how a firm works — can execute customized workflows, asynchronously, non-stop. An analyst at a private equity firm could instruct their agent to analyze a target company’s filings, build comps, generate a valuation model in Excel and prepare a draft investor memo — all within a single query loop. But the analyst isn’t being replaced, they’re being freed up from repetitive work so they can “focus on more interesting, investigative or curious tasks,” Sivulka told NYNext. “It’s almost like having a really capable intern.” Sivulka initially planned to pursue a career in academia, not business. He spent nearly a decade at Stanford, earning his undergraduate and master’s degrees before enrolling in a fully funded PhD program. Over the years, he saw innumerable peers leave for white-collar jobs and come back disillusioned. They had secured high-paying, high-powered gigs, yet they spent their days copying data into slides or skimming dense filings for small insights. “Some of the smartest people in the world were doing some of the stupidest tasks,” Sivulka said. So he dropped out, moved into a closet in East Palo Alto, and started working on what would become Hebbia. Each morning he would wake up, code for 16 hours and cold-call prospective clients. This was back before the world had heard of ChatGPT, when AI was still a murky and misunderstood term. Most investors didn’t bite at his ideas for intelligence tools, but eventually, a few did: Peter Thiel, Mike Volpi at Index, and later, Andreessen Horowitz growth partner Alex Immerman. Sivulka ultimately decided to base Hebbia in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood to get away from the pervasive “groupthink” of the Bay Area. He relishes being near to those he and his growing team are making tools for. “We’re in New York [because] there’s nothing like actually being able to understand user pain, to be on the floor with our customers,” he said. Just as Zoom made offices location-agnostic, Sivulka thinks AI will make companies compositionally agnostic. The new normal won’t just be in-person or remote, “You’ll have hybrid teams of AI agents and humans.” This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC’s power players (and those who aspire to be). He notes that in recent decades, despite software services and cloud platforms, productivity per employee hasn’t changed much. He believes AI has the power to finally move the needle, dramatically changing how companies work. “AI is actually delivering hours and hours of time savings,” he said. “We’re seeing tangible results.” Send NYNext a tip: nynextlydia@nypost.com Advertisement

Title: Private equity wants in on your 401(k). What you need to know before investing | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/business/private-equity-401k-investing-explained
Time Published: 2025-06-13T09:30:03Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Chances are very good that your 401(k) does not currently offer you access to private equity investments, which, as the name implies, are investments in companies that are not publicly traded. The question is, will that change in the next few years? And, if it does, is it worth it for you to invest? Large company pension plans and university endowments — both of which have very long time horizons — have invested for years in private equity and private debt funds. But 401(k)s typically haven’t offered those options to plan participants. In November 2024, only 2.4% of 401(k) sponsors said they added a private equity investment option to their plan, according to a weekly poll question from the Plan Sponsor Council of America. That may be because employers are afraid of potential lawsuits if they include those options, which typically charge investors more than investment funds in public companies. And under the Employment Retirement Security Act (ERISA), employers have a fiduciary duty to ensure that investment options in your 401(k) are prudent and have reasonable fees, said Jerry Schlichter, founding partner of Schlichter Bogard, who pioneered lawsuits against plan sponsors for charging excess 401(k) fees. It also may be because private assets are riskier to invest in and information about them is opaque, since they’re private. So there is less of a requirement to be transparent with investors about how a fund is doing on a regular basis. In addition, private capital options are considered illiquid investments because you can’t take your money out whenever you want. And that may prove too constraining for retirement plan participants, who may need access to their 401(k) money for any number of reasons — including changing or losing a job, Schlichter said. There has been an increasing push to provide more private capital investment opportunities for retail investors and participants in workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. On the regulatory front, according to Jaret Seiberg, a financial services policy analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, the Trump administration is likely to make it easier to access so-called alternative investments, which include private equity, private real estate and hedge funds. That could result in an executive order from the president requiring government agencies to expand access to such investments as well as rulemaking or guidance from the Department of Labor — which enforces ERISA — “to expand the ability of individuals to invest in 401(k) and IRA accounts in alternative investments,” Seiberg said in a daily research note. There are far fewer public companies today than there were 30 years ago, as more companies remain private. For that reason, some say, if investors want to own the whole market and have a truly diversified portfolio, where some asset classes move up when others move down, they should have access both to public and private companies. In a recent conversation with Morningstar, BlackRock chief operating officer Robert Goldstein noted that the performances of publicly traded stocks and bonds have become more correlated than they used to be, and “many of the less correlated assets are only accessible through the private markets.” That may be. Or not. For average retail investors, it could be hard to tell because there currently isn’t a centralized way to track the performance and underlying investments of private capital funds and directly compare them to that of the stock and bond funds and indexes they’re used to. That’s just one reason why other market watchers and investor advocates worry about expanding access to private capital for average retirement savers. Among those squarely in the camp of those who say employee and retiree nest eggs won’t be helped — and could be harmed — by having exposure to private capital is Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, a nonprofit seeking to promote the public interest in financial markets. “Why is there a push to open up the private markets to 401(k)s now? It’s not because workers want less liquid and harder-to-value assets in their 401(k)s. And it’s not motivated by plan sponsors, who have long worried that exposing 401(k) plan participants to private market assets would violate their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the investors,” Schiffrin said in a statement. “It’s because private market firms are finding it harder now to raise money. Their traditional sources of funding — institutional investors such as pensions and endowments — have evaporated.” Indeed, for plan sponsors, including private equity among their plan’s investment options will require a lot more due diligence from them in terms of investigating the underlying investments in a given fund and examining the fee structure, Schlichter said. “This is fraught with danger. A company that puts private equity in its 401(k) is undertaking a serious risk of breaching its fiduciary duty.” Credit ratings agency Moody’s this week put out an analysis, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which cautioned that the accelerated push to give private capital firms access to the multitrillion-dollar retirement investment industry holds risk for everyone. “Competition for retail investor capital within private markets will intensify as alternative asset managers roll out new partnerships and special funds to address this potentially vast, still largely untapped market,” the analysts wrote. “But rapid growth within this still relatively opaque market also carries systemic implications.” One example, they cited, is the potential for a liquidity crisis. “Unlike institutional investors, retail investors expect ready access to their cash. To help, managers are launching products with periodic windows of liquidity. But in volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product’s available liquidity and what investors are expecting.” The promise of investing in private equity is that the additional expense and risk assumed by investors can be rewarded with potentially strong returns over time. While it’s hard to easily and quickly track private equity performance on your own, there have been academic and industry studies on it, and the results have been mixed, said Jason Kephart, senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar. So, while you will likely pay more and have less transparency into what you’re investing in, having a stake in private capital is no guarantee that you will enjoy meaningfully better returns in your portfolio. As for the diversification argument, Kephart said, it’s worth remembering that just as with public companies, private companies’ performance will be affected by external forces such as economic downturns, interest rates, geopolitical concerns, tariffs and supply chain issues. “Being private doesn’t shield you from the world,” he noted. And, Kephart added, “It’s not like the public markets are broken. Public stocks and bonds have paid off pretty well for those who’ve stayed invested.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: While Tesla Talks, Waymo Drives

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. PARIS, FRANCE - JUNE 12: The logo of car manufacturer Tesla, owned by the US billionaire, Elon Musk ... More is displayed during the 9th edition of the VivaTech show at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on June 12, 2025 in Paris, France. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has established itself as a frontrunner in the realm of autonomous driving for quite some time. Its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software improves the driving experience by automating specific tasks, enabling Tesla vehicles to navigate, change lanes, and park independently while necessitating the driver’s active supervision. However, despite years of anticipation and high investor expectations, Tesla’s FSD does not seemingly make a substantial contribution to the company's revenues, while other tech giants like Google have been ramping up their investments in self-driving technology. Concurrently, higher-margin software products such as FSD are becoming increasingly crucial to Tesla’s growth narrative as its core EV business faces pressure from waning demand and heightened price competition. So, what is the current status of the FSD software? Tesla offers FSD as either a one-time purchase of $8,000 or a subscription priced at $99 per month. We believe the subscription option is likely to be the preferred choice for most new Tesla buyers due to its flexibility and lower initial cost. Although Tesla does not report FSD revenue separately, estimates from RBC Capital Markets indicate that roughly 5% of customers chose the subscription by early 2024. This attach rate has likely improved after Tesla reduced the monthly fee by 50% to $100 by April 2024. Based on vehicle delivery forecasts for 2025, we estimate that Tesla could sell approximately 1.7 million vehicles this year. If we assume that 10% of these customers opt for the FSD subscription, that results in about 170,000 additional subscriptions. This would raise cumulative subscriptions to around 460,000 by the end of this year. See detailed calculations in our dashboard How Big Is Tesla’s Software Business? At a monthly rate of $100, that translates to approximately $550 million in annual revenue for Tesla. While this is significant, it remains a small portion of Tesla’s total sales, and it falls short of justifying the substantial valuation premium that Tesla’s stock commands on account of FSD’s long-term potential. On a different note, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Elon Musk has continuously promised significant advancements in autonomy, yet Tesla has frequently missed its own timelines. For example, Musk had asserted that v13 of the FSD software would facilitate a 5 to 6 times increase in miles driven between disengagements compared to the v12.5 version. The miles between critical disengagements, which indicates the average distance a vehicle travels before the system must be disengaged, is regarded as a vital safety metric for FSD. Nonetheless, data now reveals that v13 yielded barely a 2.5 times improvement, increasing from 200 miles to about 495 miles. The head of FSD at Tesla has previously mentioned that for Tesla to achieve truly unsupervised self-driving, the average number of miles per critical intervention would need to match the “equivalent of human miles between collisions,” which stands at approximately 700,000 miles. By this measure, it appears Tesla has a considerable distance to cover. Conversely, Alphabet’s Waymo has been quietly and consistently making tangible strides in the real world. The company is currently conducting over 250,000 fully autonomous, paid rides each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, a significant increase from around 10,000 rides merely two years ago. Waymo’s vehicles operate without any human oversight, in contrast to Tesla’s FSD, which still requires driver supervision. Additionally, riders seem to have a preference for Waymo; according to Earnest Analytics, Waymo retains riders at a higher rate than Uber or Lyft. This implies that once individuals experience fully autonomous rides, they favor them. Safety could also be a compelling selling point. Waymo’s safety report from last year indicated that its autonomous vehicles achieved a 78% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers. See: Waymo To Separate From Google? That being said, Tesla has some advantages at this moment. Waymo’s system relies on a comprehensive hardware stack that includes custom lidar and radar sensors as well as cameras that are retrofitted to the vehicles it procures from traditional automakers. In contrast, Tesla relies on a camera-only system powered by neural networks. This approach makes Tesla’s system potentially simpler and cheaper to scale. Furthermore, there are likely over 5 million Teslas currently on the road, and it’s reasonable to assume that a significant percentage of these vehicles are equipped with the necessary hardware to run FSD software. If the software can advance accordingly, Tesla could activate a vast FSD user base, swiftly altering the economics of its business.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The truth about this fraud was revealed through a series of disclosures culminating in February 2025 and March 2025. In February 2025, DoubleVerify reported disappointing earnings and disclosed a multiyear deceleration trend due to the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell 36 percent. Then, in March 2025, market research company Adalytics Research released a report claiming that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services are ineffective, and that DoubleVerify customers are regularly billed for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Title: Smart Speculation vs. Gambling
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/smart-speculation-vs-gambling/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T21:57:10Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedJune 12, 2025 Watching sports these days feels completely different than it did a decade ago. These days, half the ads are about gambling. During pre-game shows, analysts seem to spend more time on betting strategies than actual analysis. Major sports leagues like the NFL now openly partner with sports books and gambling platforms. That was once a red line which respectable leagues wouldn’t cross. Influencers promote “parlay” strategies which involve 5-10 legs and offer the chance to earn 50x. But in truth, parlays are where the sports books make the most money. Another hard truth is that only about 5% of sports bettors withdraw more than they put in. It’s very difficult to overcome the house’s edge. The average sports bet has a commission rate of around 9%, which only a very lucky minority can overcome. Lower income households are disproportionately affected by sports gambling. This group spends a much larger percentage of income on sports betting, as shown in the chart below. Source: Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting’s Impact on Vulnerable Households As you can see from the chart, this problem is only getting worse. In 2024 Americans legally wagered around $148 billion on sports, up a massive 23% from 2023. Look, it’s a free country and some people are capable of gambling responsibly. I myself play in a few fantasy football leagues with friends and co-workers, and it’s great fun. But I won’t allow myself to download a sports book app. It’d be too tempting to gamble on 8-leg parlays in the hopes of hitting a 50x. Much better to stick to what I know: contrarian and long-term investing. The fact that Americans increasingly see sports gambling as a path to riches is downright scary… Our nation’s obsession with gambling extends beyond sports. We see it in crypto markets, margin trading, meme stocks, options mania, and crazy stock valuations. America is in the midst of a decade-long speculation bender. This trend is being driven by fundamental factors which cannot be ignored. The core problem is that the cost of living is rising far faster than wages. Younger generations face completely unaffordable home prices, expensive stocks, a brutal job market, and stagnant pay. Many see speculation and gambling as the only way out. The average person knows little about the stock market, but they do know something about sports. So the sports gambling path seems to offer an exit from the rat race. But it’s the worst possible route to riches. Overcoming the house advantage may as well be impossible. If you find yourself in a situation where you “need” to speculate, do it smartly. Don’t bet on 9-leg sports parlays which are never going to hit. For people with limited savings, speculation shouldn’t even be on the menu. It’s much better to invest in yourself. Try building a business on the side. This is how the vast majority of self-made individuals become wealthy. In contrast, the number of people who got rich through pure speculation is miniscule. Especially from a low starting point. If you have $500 to invest, it’s much better to buy a pressure washer and hit the streets rather than speculate on dubious investments. The pressure washer has a high probability of paying for itself many times over, assuming the owner is willing to apply the necessary elbow grease. Meanwhile, $500 on sports parlays may as well be flushed down the toilet. Building a business today is more accessible than ever. A motivated and curious person can use cheap AI tools to build a website, write a business plan, get legal advice, and brainstorm marketing ideas. Just a few years ago these setup costs could have easily totaled $10,000+. If you’re unemployed or struggling, one of the best investments you can make is in your own AI skills. Just go to ChatGPT.com and start experimenting. You can do a lot even with a free account. A premium subscription costs $20 per month and used correctly can provide an incredible ROI. One could argue that a $20/month ChatGPT membership is far more valuable than a $150k MBA in today’s world. The future belongs to entrepreneurs and those who learn to harness AI to its full potential. For those who do have funds to invest, only a portion should be used for high-risk bets. The majority should be put into tax-protected retirement accounts like a 401k or IRA, and invested in index or target-date retirement funds. Of course, a portion of your portfolio can be invested in speculative assets. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with smart and disciplined speculation. For example, well-researched and executed options bets can improve long-term returns. But we need to recognize the increased risk in this area, and treat it with respect. Keep options betting to a small portion (5% or less) of your overall portfolio. And no, that doesn’t mean invest 5% on a single options trade. It means that only 5% of your total portfolio should be dedicated to options, and that’s it. If you lose that 5%, don’t dip into the core. Personally, I feel safe putting a larger percentage of my assets in long-term contrarian investments. For me, that often means buying out of favor assets like emerging markets (Brazil is a personal favorite currently – see more here). Silver miners are another of my favorite speculative investments today. They are a classic asymmetric trade, meaning they have far more upside potential than downside. Read more about the silver miner thesis in Something to Behold. These examples are speculative, but in a smart way. They couldn’t be more different from sports gambling. This method takes patience, but it has an infinitely higher chance of producing wealth than gambling and other dubious methods. Look for more contrarian investment ideas in the near future.

Title: BlackRock’s BUIDL nears $3B, registers 3x increase in less than 90 days

The fund also register another monthly dividend record, distributing over $10 million in May. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) expanded by about $1 billion between March 26 and June 11, representing roughly half of the $2 billion growth of the tokenized US treasuries market in the period. According to rwa.xyz data, BUIDL’s size is $2.89 billion as of June 11. It is the largest tokenized money fund, representing 40% of the $7.34 billion market. The March 26 benchmark is significant because it’s when Ethena Labs stopped adding the fund shares to back its USDtb stablecoin. USDtb drove most of BUIDL’s growth in 2025, channeling 90% of its reserves into the fund, totaling $1.3 billion. Consequently, the significant 35% growth in less than three months without Ethena’s boost suggests continuing demand for regulated, high-yield cash instruments on public blockchains. Furthermore, the fund has grown by nearly three times since it reached $1 billion on March 13, achieving this milestone in just over a year. However, it took less than 90 days to triple the amount, suggesting a spike in interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, especially tokenized US treasuries. According to rwa.xyz’s overview, the RWA market grew by nearly $5 billion between March 13 and June 11. The tokenized US treasuries market represented almost half of the global RWA market growth. As shared on June 12 by ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci, BlackRock recently published its effort to bridge the traditional capital markets “with the developing digital assets ecosystem,” currently focusing on tokenized funds. Alongside asset growth, BUIDL’s income distributions continued to set new highs. The fund paid $4.17 million in March, pushing cumulative payouts above $25 million. April dividends rose to about $7.9 million, lifting lifetime payments past $33 million, according to issuer posts. May distributions exceeded $10 million, bringing total dividends to more than $43 million since inception. This represented the third consecutive monthly record.

U.S. data centers are rapidly driving up demand for power, with the official forecast for electricity consumption next year almost doubling in the past month. Total power usage in the U.S. is expected to climb 2.15% in 2026, spurred largely by a 5% spike from commercial users because of the expansion of data centers, according to a U.S. Energy Department report released this week. That’s up sharply from a month ago, when the agency expected commercial demand to rise by 2% and total consumption to gain by 1.12%. Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant. U.S. filings for jobless benefits were unchanged last week, remaining at the higher end of recent ranges as uncertainty over the impact of trade wars lingers. New applications for jobless benefits numbered 248,000 for the week ending June 7, the Labor Department said Thursday. Analysts had forecast 244,000 new applications. A week ago, there were 248,000 jobless claim applications, which was the most since early October and a sign that layoffs could be trending higher. “There are early warning signs in the labor market,” said Navy Federal Credit Union’s chief economist, Heather Long. “If layoffs worsen this summer, it will heighten fears of a recession and consumer spending pullback.” On Wednesday, Google confirmed that it had offered buyouts to a swath of its workforce in a fresh round of cost-cutting ahead of a court decision that could order a breakup of its internet empire. Other companies that have announced job cuts this year include Procter & Gamble, Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft and Facebook parent company Meta.

Title: BlackRock Aims for $400B in Private Market Fundraising by 2030

BlackRock Inc. wants to achieve $400 billion in cumulative fundraising between 2025 and 2030, according to an investor day presentation released Thursday. The $10 trillion asset manager’s vision includes expanding its alternative investment offerings to insurers and wealth managers, leveraging its recent manager acquisitions and technology offerings. The firm recently acquired infrastructure investor Global Infrastructure Partners ($170 billion assets under management) and expects to close its acquisition of private credit manager HPS Investment Partners ($157 billion AUM) in the third quarter. HPS and BlackRock reported that together, as of the first quarter, they had $14 billion in fee-paying credit AUM in existing wealth management channels, a figure they hope to grow to at least $60 billion by 2030 by expanding into European direct lending, private asset-based income products and offering private credit investments across wealth management channels. BlackRock, through its acquisition of GIP, has become the world’s largest infrastructure manager, and it sees private capital bridging the infrastructure funding gap. According to BlackRock, the world needs $94 trillion in infrastructure funding by 2040, of which a $15 trillion gap exists between the current pace of investment and what will be needed. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  The asset manager wants to increase its annual revenue to more than $35 billion from $20 billion by the end of the decade, nearly doubling operating income to $15 billion from $8 billion and doubling its market capitalization to $280 billion from $140 billion. Revenue derived from private markets and technology is expected to double as a percentage of BlackRock’s income. In 2024, private markets and technology accounted for 15% of the firm’s $20 billion in revenue. In 2030, BlackRock wants these businesses to account for 30% of total revenue.

Title: Hamas Attacks Aid Group, Challenging Israel’s Gaza Plan

Time Published: 2025-06-12T19:03:58Z

By Mac William Bishop An ambush allegedly carried out by Hamas on Wednesday killed at least eight Palestinian aid workers, with an unknown number of others taken hostage, according to an aid group. The apparent massacre makes clear that Hamas, even after a year and half of deadly military strikes carried out by Israel that have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, remains operational. It also underscores the difficulties faced by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose local Palestinian employees were the target of the attack. “We are still collecting more information on the deadly and unprovoked attack on our dedicated local team members and volunteers. As of now, we can confirm at least eight fatalities, multiple injuries, and we fear that some of our team members have been taken hostage,” GHF Interim Executive Director John Acree said in a statement. “This attack did not happen in a vacuum. For days, Hamas has openly threatened our team, our aid workers, and the civilians who receive aid from us,” a GHF spokesperson said in a statement. “The GHF holds Hamas fully responsible for taking the lives of our dedicated workers who have been distributing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people at the foundation’s sites in central and southern Gaza. Tonight, the world must see this for what it is: an attack on humanity.” Indeed, nothing surrounding GHF has occurred in a vacuum. Since its inception earlier this year, the foundation has been a focal point of criticism from international aid groups, human rights organizations, and pro-Palestinian activists. In mid-May, more than two dozen burly Americans arrived in Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport, with photos of the men circulating across social media and local news outlets speculating about their purpose. Private military contractors – mercenaries – had previously been hired by two U.S. security companies to work in Gaza manning checkpoints, under the sanction of the Israel Defense Forces. But the group that arrived in Tel Aviv represented something new. They were the vanguard of GHF, a newly established non-profit intended to place the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza outside the purview of the United Nations — and under the control of the Israeli government. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The Israeli military has strictly controlled access to Gaza since Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7, 2023, and humanitarian groups cannot deliver aid to the territory without its cooperation. Israel has periodically restricted or blocked aid deliveries, to the point that aid groups have regularly issued warnings of imminent famine. The most recent blockade started on March 2, and continued until mid-May. Some aid groups have described the aid blockade as a deliberate strategy, designed to starve the civilian population of Gaza, and some have even called it a war crime, or part of an overall plan to ethnically cleanse the territory. Others see a motive that is equally ruthless, but with a more immediate political goal: By cutting out aid groups with established ground operations, and putting Gaza aid in the hands of a friendly non-profit, Tel Aviv hopes to reduce Hamas’ influence. Tel Aviv has long viewed the UN and its local agency, UNRWA, as essentially under the control of Hamas, and antipathetic to Israel’s existence. “Distribution of food and humanitarian aid is one of the major tools that Hamas uses as a means to maintain its ruling capacity, and for the time being, to maintain its relationship with the major clans or families in the Gaza Strip,” says Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and Arab affairs specialist. Related Content Marines Arrive in Los Angeles as City Braces for 'No Kings’ Protests Trump’s Military Crackdown Is Starting To Dent His Poll Numbers Kim Gordon Has Words for Donald Trump on Re-Recorded ‘Bye Bye 25!’ Trump Calls on Iran to Agree to Nuclear Deal ‘Before There Is Nothing Left’ He notes instances of organized looting outside the control of Hamas, saying Israel’s aid blockades have created a “volatile dynamic” in the relations between the political group and the network of Gaza’s powerful clans — perhaps intentionally. Israel’s strategy with aid in Gaza “mostly has to do with the whole issue of putting pressure on Hamas, in the sense of neutralizing or limiting its ability to continue to dictate its agenda… it is basically trying to reduce or minimize as much as possible [Hamas’] governance capacity and role in the Gaza Strip.” The men behind GHF are a hodgepodge of former military and intelligence officials, backed by Israeli tech billionaires, an Armenian financier with a checkered past, and tens of millions of dollars from unknown donors. The international version of GHF was established as a stiftung — the designation for a nonprofit foundation in Switzerland — on Feb. 11 this year, according to documents published by the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce. Its purpose was “specifically to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in the Gaza Strip, including the secure provision of food, water, medicine, shelter, and reconstruction.” The president of the foundation was listed as David Papazian, an Armenian investor. A brief examination of Papazian reveals a curious background for an aid executive, with links to a 2015 insider-trading cyber-hacking scandal, ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, and a key role in development projects funded by the United Arab Emirates while head of Armenia’s state-backed development fund — a position from which he was ousted in January 2024 amid questions about his governance. Another individual listed in the GHF’s international documents was David Kohler, a Cologne-based and “Swiss-registered lawyer with experience in handling complex cross-border transactions, contract and corporate matters, capital markets and financing issues,” who has “significant experience in representing clients in Europe, the U.S., the Middle East and Russia,” according to his LinkedIn profile. On May 14, as questions about the foundation’s legitimacy and ability to deliver aid proliferated, Kohler resigned from the stiftung’s board. The final person listed on GHF’s Swiss registration is Loik Henderson, an Arlington-based lawyer who serves as general counsel for Protection Services Inc., a private security company that provides “comprehensive security solutions and personnel security expertise to the U.S. government.” Henderson is also listed as the president of GHF in its U.S. incorporation documents. Where the money for all of this is coming from is not clear — GHF officials have talked about receiving a “$100 million donation” from an unspecified source. One Middle Eastern intelligence source tells Rolling Stone a substantial amount of money was most likely provided by the UAE, which has been quietly working with both Israel and the Trump administration behind the scenes in Gaza. The U.S. State Department is also considering funneling $500 million to GHF, Reuters reported last week. In addition, The Washington Post reported that two Israeli tech moguls were backing GHF, naming them as “Liran Tancman, an entrepreneur and reservist in the IDF’s 8200 signals intelligence unit, who called for using biometric identification systems outside the distribution hubs to vet Palestinian civilians. Another was Michael Eisenberg, an American Israeli venture capitalist who argued that existing U.N. aid distribution networks were sustaining Hamas and needed to be overhauled.” On the ground, two private security contract firms have been tied to GHF, with Reuters reporting one as “UG Solutions — a low-profile company founded in 2023 and based in Davidson, North Carolina,” which began hiring security personnel earlier this year, offering “a daily rate starting at $1,100 with a $10,000 advance to veterans it hires.” According to The New York Times, GHF’s security and logistics plan appears to have been developed under the direction of Israel, working with Safe Reach Solutions, a newly formed Wyoming-based company headed by Phillip F. Reilly, a retired CIA paramilitary officer and former agency station chief in Afghanistan. Amid this panoply of international lawyers, guns, and money, GHF also went looking for officials from the humanitarian sector with the experience and gravitas to lend the organization credibility. Initial documents from the foundation listed a number of respected veterans of international aid work for potential senior positions. These included David Beasley, the former head of the World Food Program, and Nate Mook, the former chief executive of World Central Kitchen. Both men subsequently denied they had agreed to join the organization. The man who did become the public face of GHF was Jake Wood, a former U.S. Marine and social entrepreneur best known for co-founding Team Rubicon, a veteran-based emergency response nonprofit. As it prepared to begin operations, Wood took to the airwaves, describing the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza and calling on international aid organizations to work with GHF, rather than criticize it. His leadership was short-lived. On May 26, as the media furor swelled ahead of GHF’s first deployment, Wood announced he was resigning from the foundation, saying he no longer believed in its “neutrality, impartiality and independence.” Veteran aid workers, who had been saying this from the start, were celebratory. “I hope this idea of having a privatized, militarized, and politicized humanitarian aid organization is gone forever,” says Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “We cannot work with Hamas, and we cannot work with Israel.” But GHF was far from finished. An evangelical activist with close ties to President Donald Trump, Rev. Johnnie Moore, was appointed as chairman of GHF after Wood’s departure. Since it started operations at the end of May, scenes of food distribution sites run by GHF — densely packed crowds of refugees gathered in the hot sun, corralled into mazes of chain link fencing to wait for hours for the chance to receive food supplies — confirmed the fears of many critics that the group was in over its head. A series of deadly incidents involving people gathering to collect food at GHF-run distribution sites have resulted in dozens killed, with Palestinians claiming the Israeli military was responsible. Israel, in turn, has disavowed responsibility. Meanwhile, the GHF has been adamant that none of the incidents at distribution sites were the result of actions taken by its personnel. “As we have repeatedly cautioned, there are many parties who wish to see GHF fail. Their goal is to force a return to the status quo, even if it means risking life-saving aid to the people of Gaza,” a GHF spokesperson wrote on May 28. Since beginning operations, GHF says that it has delivered 19 million meals at four sites, with three remaining operational. The attack on the busload of Palestinians working for GHF makes it clear that the group is in the crosshairs of Hamas. For now, it continues its operations. “This has been a painful day but our team made the decision that the best way to honor the memory of our local Palestinian colleagues was to press on, proceeding with food distribution today, as planned,” wrote Moore, the GHF chairman. “We provided food for 2.6 million meals TODAY.” Contrary to the neutrality espoused by most international aid groups, GHF has been explicit that it views Hamas as the primary barrier to delivery of aid in Gaza. “Hamas wants to return to a broken system it once controlled and exploited — diverting aid, manipulating distribution, and putting its own agenda ahead of the Palestinian people’s basic needs,” a GHF spokesperson said.

Server manufacturers may vary configurations, yielding different results. Results may vary based on use of the latest drivers and optimizations.MI350-004 iiMI350-044: Based on AMD internal testing as of 6/9/2025. Using 8 GPU AMD Instinct™ MI355X Platform measuring text generated online serving inference throughput for Llama 3.1-405B chat model (FP4) compared 8 GPU AMD Instinct™ MI300X Platform performance with (FP8). Test was performed using input length of 32768 tokens and an output length of 1024 tokens with concurrency set to best available throughput to achieve 60ms on each platform, 1 for MI300X (35.3ms) and 64ms for MI355X platforms (50.6ms). Server manufacturers may vary configurations, yielding different results. Performance may vary based on use of latest drivers and optimizations. iii Based on performance testing by AMD Labs as of 6/6/2025, measuring the text generated inference throughput on the LLaMA 3.1-405B model using the FP4 datatype with various combinations of input, output token length with AMD Instinct™ MI355X 8x GPU, and published results for the NVIDIA B200 HGX 8xGPU. Performance per dollar calculated with current pricing for NVIDIA B200 available from Coreweave website and expected Instinct MI355X based cloud instance pricing. Server manufacturers may vary configurations, yielding different results. Performance may vary based on use of latest drivers and optimizations. Current customer pricing as of June 10, 2025, and subject to change. MI350-049 iv MI400-001: Performance projection as of 06/05/2025 using engineering estimates based on the design of a future AMD Instinct MI400 Series GPU compared to the Instinct MI355x, with 2K and 16K prefill with TP8, EP8 and projected inference performance, and using a GenAI training model evaluated with GEMM and Attention algorithms for the Instinct MI400 Series. Results may vary when products are released in market. (MI400-001)v EPYC-030a: Calculation includes 1) base case kWhr use projections in 2025 conducted with Koomey Analytics based on available research and data that includes segment specific projected 2025 deployment volumes and data center power utilization effectiveness (PUE) including GPU HPC and machine learning (ML) installations and 2) AMD CPU and GPU node power consumptions incorporating segment-specific utilization (active vs. idle) percentages and multiplied by PUE to determine actual total energy use for calculation of the performance per Watt. 38x is calculated using the following formula: (base case HPC node kWhr use projection in 2025 * AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using DGEMM and TEC +Base case ML node kWhr use projection in 2025 *AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using ML math and TEC) /(Base case projected kWhr usage in 2025). For more information, https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/data-center-sustainability.html. vi AMD based advanced racks for AI training/inference in each year (2024 to 2030) based on AMD roadmaps, also examining historical trends to inform rack design choices and technology improvements to align projected goals and historical trends. The 2024 rack is based on the MI300X node, which is comparable to the Nvidia H100 and reflects current common practice in AI deployments in 2024/2025 timeframe. The 2030 rack is based on an AMD system and silicon design expectations for that time frame. In each case, AMD specified components like GPUs, CPUs, DRAM, storage, cooling, and communications, tracking component and defined rack characteristics for power and performance. Calculations do not include power used for cooling air or water supply outside the racks but do include power for fans and pumps internal to the racks.Performance improvements are estimated based on progress in compute output (delivered, sustained, not peak FLOPS), memory (HBM) bandwidth, and network (scale-up) bandwidth, expressed as indices and weighted by the following factors for training and inference. Performance and power use per rack together imply trends in performance per watt over time for training and inference, then indices for progress in training and inference are weighted 50:50 to get the final estimate of AMD projected progress by 2030 (20x). The performance number assumes continued AI model progress in exploiting lower precision math formats for both training and inference which results in both an increase in effective FLOPS and a reduction in required bandwidth per FLOP. vii AMD estimated the number of racks to train a typical notable AI model based on EPOCH AI data (https://epoch.ai). For this calculation we assume, based on these data, that a typical model takes 1025 floating point operations to train (based on the median of 2025 data), and that this training takes place over 1 month. FLOPs needed = 10^25 FLOPs/(seconds/month)/Model FLOPs utilization (MFU) = 10^25/(2.6298*10^6)/0.6. Racks = FLOPs needed/(FLOPS/rack in 2024 and 2030). The compute performance estimates from the AMD roadmap suggests that approximately 276 racks would be needed in 2025 to train a typical model over one month using the MI300X product (assuming 22.656 PFLOPS/rack with 60% MFU) and <1 fully utilized rack would be needed to train the same model in 2030 using a rack configuration based on an AMD roadmap projection. These calculations imply a >276-fold reduction in the number of racks to train the same model over this six-year period. Electricity use for a MI300X system to completely train a defined 2025 AI model using a 2024 rack is calculated at ~7GWh, whereas the future 2030 AMD system could train the same model using ~350 MWh, a 95% reduction. AMD then applied carbon intensities per kWh from the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook 2024 [https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024]. IEA’s stated policy case gives carbon intensities for 2023 and 2030. We determined the average annual change in intensity from 2023 to 2030 and applied that to the 2023 intensity to get 2024 intensity (434 CO2 g/kWh) versus the 2030 intensity (312 CO2 g/kWh). Emissions for the 2024 baseline scenario of 7 GWh x 434 CO2 g/kWh equates to approximately 3000 metric tC02, versus the future 2030 scenario of 350 MWh x 312 CO2 g/kWh equates to around100 metric tCO2.

(MI400-001)v EPYC-030a: Calculation includes 1) base case kWhr use projections in 2025 conducted with Koomey Analytics based on available research and data that includes segment specific projected 2025 deployment volumes and data center power utilization effectiveness (PUE) including GPU HPC and machine learning (ML) installations and 2) AMD CPU and GPU node power consumptions incorporating segment-specific utilization (active vs. idle) percentages and multiplied by PUE to determine actual total energy use for calculation of the performance per Watt. 38x is calculated using the following formula: (base case HPC node kWhr use projection in 2025 * AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using DGEMM and TEC +Base case ML node kWhr use projection in 2025 *AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using ML math and TEC) /(Base case projected kWhr usage in 2025). For more information, https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/data-center-sustainability.html. vi AMD based advanced racks for AI training/inference in each year (2024 to 2030) based on AMD roadmaps, also examining historical trends to inform rack design choices and technology improvements to align projected goals and historical trends. The 2024 rack is based on the MI300X node, which is comparable to the Nvidia H100 and reflects current common practice in AI deployments in 2024/2025 timeframe. The 2030 rack is based on an AMD system and silicon design expectations for that time frame. In each case, AMD specified components like GPUs, CPUs, DRAM, storage, cooling, and communications, tracking component and defined rack characteristics for power and performance. Calculations do not include power used for cooling air or water supply outside the racks but do include power for fans and pumps internal to the racks.Performance improvements are estimated based on progress in compute output (delivered, sustained, not peak FLOPS), memory (HBM) bandwidth, and network (scale-up) bandwidth, expressed as indices and weighted by the following factors for training and inference. Performance and power use per rack together imply trends in performance per watt over time for training and inference, then indices for progress in training and inference are weighted 50:50 to get the final estimate of AMD projected progress by 2030 (20x). The performance number assumes continued AI model progress in exploiting lower precision math formats for both training and inference which results in both an increase in effective FLOPS and a reduction in required bandwidth per FLOP. vii AMD estimated the number of racks to train a typical notable AI model based on EPOCH AI data (https://epoch.ai). For this calculation we assume, based on these data, that a typical model takes 1025 floating point operations to train (based on the median of 2025 data), and that this training takes place over 1 month. FLOPs needed = 10^25 FLOPs/(seconds/month)/Model FLOPs utilization (MFU) = 10^25/(2.6298*10^6)/0.6. Racks = FLOPs needed/(FLOPS/rack in 2024 and 2030). The compute performance estimates from the AMD roadmap suggests that approximately 276 racks would be needed in 2025 to train a typical model over one month using the MI300X product (assuming 22.656 PFLOPS/rack with 60% MFU) and <1 fully utilized rack would be needed to train the same model in 2030 using a rack configuration based on an AMD roadmap projection. These calculations imply a >276-fold reduction in the number of racks to train the same model over this six-year period. Electricity use for a MI300X system to completely train a defined 2025 AI model using a 2024 rack is calculated at ~7GWh, whereas the future 2030 AMD system could train the same model using ~350 MWh, a 95% reduction. AMD then applied carbon intensities per kWh from the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook 2024 [https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024]. IEA’s stated policy case gives carbon intensities for 2023 and 2030. We determined the average annual change in intensity from 2023 to 2030 and applied that to the 2023 intensity to get 2024 intensity (434 CO2 g/kWh) versus the 2030 intensity (312 CO2 g/kWh). Emissions for the 2024 baseline scenario of 7 GWh x 434 CO2 g/kWh equates to approximately 3000 metric tC02, versus the future 2030 scenario of 350 MWh x 312 CO2 g/kWh equates to around100 metric tCO2.

The Gigagas roadmap positions Polygon for high-throughput financial applications with planned scalability and instant finality. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Polygon has laid out an ambitious scaling roadmap to reach 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), beginning with a July upgrade that will bring the network to 1,000 TPS. The roadmap comes a day after Polygon announced a governance revamp and shift in focus to Agglayer. Dubbed the “Gigagas” roadmap, the initiative is focused on making Polygon the go-to blockchain for real-world financial applications. It culminates in a long-term plan to power global-scale payments and tokenized assets. The July Bhilai Upgrade will introduce 1,000+ TPS throughput, reduce transaction finality to ~5 seconds, and stabilize gas fees under $0.001 per transaction without increasing validator requirements. In a separate development, the network’s native token POL became available on Solana (SOL) via Wormhole Bridge on June 12. By the end of this year, Polygon expects to scale past 5,000 TPS using a new Validator-Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model that streamlines block production with stateless validation and a single leader architecture. This approach removes the risk of chain reorganizations by guaranteeing one-block finality, a key requirement for institutions and financial applications demanding predictable execution. Polygon said that the 5,000 TPS benchmark has already been achieved in a devnet environment, with technical proposals (PIP-64 and others) outlining the pathway to mainnet rollout. Alongside this upgrade, Polygon will also integrate with Agglayer, a multichain interoperability layer powered by POL staking that allows seamless liquidity movement across chains. In 2026 and beyond, Polygon’s goal is to exceed 100,000 TPS through continued optimization of its validator network and deeper integration with Agglayer. It will also focus on scaling for high-volume use cases like retail payments, AI-driven microtransactions, and tokenized financial markets. The network aims to match the reliability and speed of traditional payment systems while preserving decentralization. Polygon already ranks among the top chains in stablecoin and RWA activity, with over $134 billion in stablecoin transfer volume in April and hundreds of millions in institutional RWAs deployed by firms like Apollo and BlackRock. However, the Polygon team said the chain needs to scale “an order of magnitude higher” to support trillions in on-chain value. The Gigagas roadmap signals a shift from theoretical scaling to real-world execution and positions Polygon as a high-throughput infrastructure layer for the next wave of blockchain adoption.

More Santiago/Getty Images) In the race to finally convince consumers of the benefits of AR and AI powered smart glasses, the global tech giants are heading back to the future – with stores. As Google, Apple, Meta and Snap go head to head for what they believe will be a lucrative growth market, three of the four have established store networks to introduce their products to a new generation of consumers – many of whom will not have seen Google’s pioneering but unsuccessful first attempt to create the market. Meta has partnered with Ray Ban, Apple has its own flagship store network to leverage, while the big headline came when Google recently committed to as much as $150 million with the consumer eyewear company Warby Parker. They are set to jointly develop AI-powered smart glasses based on Android XR and Google has already committed $75 million to Warby Parker’s product development and commercialization costs. Google will invest an additional $75 million, taking an equity stake in Warby Parker, should the trendy eyewear manufacturer meet certain milestones. The news immediately turbocharged Warby Parker’s stock price, which is up a little short of a fifth since the announcement after a challenging year to date which means that despite the boost the value is still around 11% off year to date. In May, Warby Parker announced first-quarter net revenue increased nearly 12% year over year to $223.8 million. It also reported its first positive quarterly net income as a public company, with $3.5 million in income compared with a loss of about $2.7 million in Q1 2024. It also opened 11 net new stores, ending the quarter with 287 locations nationwide. At the Google I/O 2025 event, Google also announced partnerships with several companies to develop smart glasses with Gemini AI and AR capabilities, including Samsung and uber trendy Korean eyewear retailer Gentle Monster. Google has no doubt taken a close look at Meta’s smart glasses strategy after the latter found success partnering and investing in the maker of iconic sunglasses brand Ray-Ban to develop its smart glasses. One of the reasons that Ray-Ban and Meta have acheived some success is that the smart glasses, far from the clunky original iterations, have a stylish and familiar design and they are being sold across Ray-Ban’s stores network.

More Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It seems likely that Google will use the same playbook with Warby Parker, taking advantage of the eyewear company’s popular frame designs and its growing network of retail stores and online presence around the country. In announcing the collaboration, Warby Parker and Google said that they intend to launch a series of products over time and forecast that their first line of eyewear will launch “after 2025” and will incorporate multimodal AI with prescription and non-prescription glasses. Meantime, Snap has announced its own plans to release a sixth-generation of its augmented reality glasses next year. The company behind Snapchat said that its next-generation glasses will be called Specs, marking a break from the company’s Spectacles branding that it has used for prior versions of its wearable devices. Specs will use AR technology to let wearers see and interact with digital imagery overlaid over the physical world and its new glasses will be smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the company said, with Snap’s most recent Spectacles released in September 2024 to developers only. Those glasses were made available under a leasing model that required users to commit to paying $99 a month for a full year. Apple is also working on its own smart glasses, based on chips used in the Apple Watch that require less energy than the components in some of its other products like the iPhone, iPad and Mac, but they may not hit the market until sometime in 2027. Apple has already leveraged its store network to launch a host of products and updates and will be able to use those stores again to provide a platform for its smart glasses technology when it finally arrives.

Micron Technology (MU) on Thursday became the latest major corporation to announce plans to expand domestic production following President Donald Trump's call for firms to boost American manufacturing. The chipmaker and the Trump administration said Micron will boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development (R&D). Micron explained that most of the money would be used for "two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia," as well as advanced high-bandwith memory (HBM) packaging capabilities. The company noted that it has already received federal, state, and local funding for the Idaho, New York, and Virginia fab work, including up to $6.4 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act. Micron added it expects all of the investments will be eligible for federal Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC). CEO Sanjay Mehrotra argued that this expansion "will reinforce America's technological leadership, create tens of thousands of American jobs across the semiconductor ecosystem and secure a domestic supply of semiconductors—critical to economic and national security." This week, General Motors (GM) announced it would spend $4 billion to increase vehicle production at three U.S. plants. Earlier this year, chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) said it planned to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities, and Apple (AAPL) announced plans to spend more than $500 billion domestically over the next four years. Shares of Micron Technology were little changed today but are up 37% this year, trading at their highest level since last July. TradingView

Title: The Ultimate Guide To Side Hustles

Time Published: 2025-06-12T15:31:46Z

ByAllBusiness ByAllBusiness, Contributor. By Dominique Harroch Side hustles can be your path to financial freedom and the life you actually want. We all could use some extra cash, right? Whether you're drowning in student loans, dreaming of that vacation to Bali, or just want some breathing room in your budget, side hustles are your ticket to financial freedom. And the best part? You don't need to quit your day job to start making serious money on the side. A side hustle is basically any gig you do outside your main job to bring in extra income. But here's where it gets exciting–today's side hustles can be incredibly flexible, creative, and surprisingly profitable. We're talking about making money from your couch, turning your hobbies into cash machines, and maybe even building the foundation for your future empire. Extra income: Let's talk money–because that's probably why you're here. We're not talking pocket change here. Many side hustlers are pulling in an extra $500 to $5,000 or more every month. That's mortgage payment money, vacation fund money, or "goodbye credit card debt" money. You're not putting all your eggs in one basket: Here's what's even better than the money itself. Is your boss having a bad day? Company downsizing? No problem. You've got multiple income streams flowing, which means you're less stressed about any financial curveballs life might throw at you. Freedom and flexibility: These are game-changers that affect everything about how you work. You decide when to work, what projects to take, and how much to charge. No more asking permission to leave early or begging for time off. Your side hustle works around YOUR life, not the other way around. Skill-building goldmine: Don't forget this massive advantage that keeps paying dividends. Every side hustle teaches you something new–marketing, customer service, time management, or whatever specialty you choose. These skills don't just make you more money; they make you more valuable everywhere. Many people have turned their side hustle skills into promotions at their day jobs or completely new career paths. Creative outlet: This aspect is huge for people stuck in boring day jobs. Tired of mind-numbing spreadsheets all day? Your side hustle can be your creative playground where you actually enjoy what you're doing while making money. It's like getting paid for your hobbies–because sometimes you literally are. Ready to dive in? Let's make this happen without overwhelming yourself. Start by getting real about your available time. Don't go crazy planning 40-hour weeks–most successful side hustlers start with just 5-10 hours per week. You can always scale up once you're making money and feeling the groove. Pick something you actually enjoy or are naturally good at. Life's too short to hate your side hustle too. If you love dogs, consider pet services. Good with words? Writing might be your goldmine. Tech-savvy? Virtual services are calling your name. Do a little homework before jumping in. Check out what others are charging, see what customers are complaining about (hello, opportunity!), and figure out how to do it better. A quick scan of Facebook groups, Reddit threads, or Google searches can save you months of trial and error. Set some goals that actually excite you. "I want to make $1,000 extra this month" hits different than "I want some extra money." Get specific about what that money will do for you–pay off your car, fund your wedding, or let you finally take that trip you've been dreaming about. Keep it simple at first. Don't worry about business licenses, fancy websites, or complicated accounting systems right out the gate. Test your idea, make some money, then worry about the fancy stuff once you know it's working. Here's the thing–having a good idea for a side hustle is just the beginning. To really make money, you need to treat it like a real business. That means showing up consistently, delivering quality work, and always looking for ways to improve and grow. Get online and stay visible. Social media isn't optional anymore–it's where your customers are hanging out. Post regularly, engage with people, and show off your work. You don't need to be everywhere, but pick 1-2 platforms and post to them consistently. Network like your bank account depends on it. Join Facebook groups, post on Instagram, attend local business events, tell everyone what you're doing. Most side hustle success comes from word-of-mouth and referrals, so make sure people know how to find you. Always be improving your game. Raise your prices as you get better, streamline your processes to work faster, and look for ways to make more money from the same effort. The difference between someone making $500 a month and $5,000 a month often comes down to these optimizations. Scale smart when you’re ready. Once you're consistently booked and making good money, think about hiring help, raising prices, or expanding your services. The goal is to make more money without working yourself to death. Time management will make or break you. Start small and build up gradually. Use calendars, time-blocking, and whatever tools keep you organized. The last thing you want is to burn out or mess up your day job. Don't undervalue yourself. Seriously, charge what you're worth. If you're too cheap, people will think you're not good. If you're delivering value, price accordingly. You can always start lower and increase as you prove yourself. Inconsistent income is part of the game, especially at first. Keep some money in the bank for slower months, and don't quit your day job until your side hustle is reliably bringing in serious money. Avoid shiny object syndrome.

Title: Strategy, GameStop Lead $50 Billion Institutional Surge Into Bitcoin as Treasury Asset

Highlights Bitcoin has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream institutional-grade investment, with Fortune 500 companies, like Strategy and GameStop among others, allocating billions to bitcoin holdings, transforming corporate treasuries into crypto-forward financial operations. Companies are leveraging complex financial instruments (e.g., convertible notes, structured products, bitcoin-backed loans) to gain crypto exposure, potentially blurring the line between financial innovation and speculative risk. The role of corporate treasurers is expanding beyond traditional finance to include crypto expertise, risk governance, and digital asset strategy, prompting a critical reevaluation of bitcoin's place on balance sheets — as a hedge, speculative asset, or branding signal — based on a company’s unique financial profile. In the early days of bitcoin, it was hard to imagine Fortune 500 treasury teams doing anything more than monitoring its unpredictable price swings out of casual interest.

Δ But 15 years and several bull-bear cycles later, the cryptocurrency is no longer just the domain of technologists and retail investors. It’s evolving into an institutional-grade asset. Not just in theory, but in practice. Fortune 500 blockchain adoption has allegedly now hit 60% with institutions injecting as much as $50 billion into crypto funds in Q1. Leading the pack is the one-time software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has compiled a war chest of 580,000 bitcoin, worth about $63 billion, since the middle of 2020, with its latest purchase coming within the past two weeks. Strategy has transformed itself into a bitcoin treasury company and is now primarily in the business of selling securities to raise money to buy the cryptocurrency. Far from being viewed as a black sheep, the company’s “bitcoin treasury” approach has spurred a wave of publicly traded copycats. GameStop, for example, on Wednesday (June 11) announced it was issuing $1.75 billion in convertible notes to buy bitcoin. This followed an earlier Q1 acquisition of 4,710 BTC (about $513 million), which made GameStop the 13th‑largest corporate holder. Elsewhere, The Blockchain Group, which describes itself as Europe’s first bitcoin treasury company, on Monday (June 9) announced a $300 million issuance for, you guessed it, the purposes of purchasing more bitcoin. From structured notes and hedging instruments to yield-bearing custodial accounts and even Bitcoin-backed loans, the ecosystem is diversifying at a pace few anticipated. But beneath the innovation lies a familiar tension: are these truly risk-managed tools for corporate finance, or cleverly packaged speculative bets in disguise? Read also: Making Sense of Bitcoin’s Growing Relevance for Corporate Treasuries Milestones like the launch of CME Bitcoin futures (2017), the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. (2024), and the entrance of traditional financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and JPMorgan into the crypto arena have provided a sense of legitimacy. With regulatory clarity slowly improving, especially around custody and reporting standards, corporate finance professionals are being offered a potential new value proposition: the cryptocurrency not as a gamble, but as a balance sheet diversification strategy. As PYMNTS covered, even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. After all, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and crypto markets in the U.S., is set to be considered by the full U.S. House of Representatives after being advanced by two House committees Tuesday (June 10). At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to ease restrictions governing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The treasurer’s role in this environment? It’s no longer merely about cash, FX, or interest rate swaps — but increasingly about whether the CFO team has the infrastructure, expertise, risk governance, and capital strategies to harness any crypto strategy judiciously. See also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know Bitcoin is maturing into a multi-dimensional treasury instrument: a defensive store-of-value, a potential yield generator and a signal of corporate innovation. But behind the headlines and bold plays lies a complex ecosystem rich with financing engineering, volatility exposure, regulatory uncertainty, and governance pitfalls. After all, for all the innovation, there’s a critical issue at the heart of this trend: are these financial tools being used to serve prudent corporate strategy, or are they a new flavor of speculative risk? Some critics argue that bitcoin-linked treasury products may be less about strategic diversification and more about corporate speculation dressed in financial engineering. Today’s suite of corporate crypto offerings are designed to mitigate some of the risks. But in doing so, they can sometimes introduce new forms of complexity — particularly around counterparty risk, liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainty. The accounting treatment of crypto assets remains a thorny issue. In the U.S., bitcoin is still classified as an intangible asset, meaning unrealized losses must be recognized, but gains can’t be booked unless the asset is sold. This creates a lopsided risk profile for public companies. Perhaps the central question for corporate treasurers is this: What is bitcoin in the context of the corporate balance sheet? Is it a modern hedge against fiat inflation, akin to gold? A speculative instrument that can juice short-term returns but introduces material downside? Or a strategic signaling tool — part financial asset, part branding exercise? The answer may depend on the type of business and its risk profile. For a tech-forward firm with high margins and a long investment horizon, limited bitcoin exposure may offer a form of asymmetric upside. For a capital-intensive industrial company with tight liquidity, it may be an unjustifiable risk.

Title: What Drove Meta Stock's 2x Rise?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/12/what-drove-meta-stocks-2x-rise/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T14:55:42Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. PARIS, FRANCE - JUNE 12: The Meta AI logo is displayed during the 9th edition of the VivaTech show ... More at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on June 12, 2025 in Paris, France. VivaTech, the biggest tech show in Europe but also in a unique digital format, for 4 days of reconnection and relaunch thanks to innovation. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) has witnessed a substantial increase, spurred by investor enthusiasm over rising user interaction and consistently robust quarterly earnings. So far this year, Meta has gained 16%, significantly outperforming the wider NASDAQ index, which has increased by 2%. Examining a slightly extended timeframe, Meta’s outperformance is even more pronounced. Since the beginning of 2024, Meta’s stock has achieved a striking 97% return, rising from about $350 to roughly $700 per share. In comparison, the NASDAQ index recorded a 31% increase during the same timeframe. The remarkable 97% increase in Meta’s stock can be linked to three primary factors: We will explore the details of these factors. While META stock has had a positive trajectory, if you seek an upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since inception. Additionally, see – Is Oracle Stock A Buy At $190? Meta Platforms stands as the world’s leading social network that connects individuals with friends and family. The company generates revenue mainly through advertising, which it offers to marketers by targeting specific demographics based on information shared by users on its platforms. Meta Platforms’ revenue growth recently can be credited to an increase in ad impressions as well as a rise in the average price per ad. Additionally, Meta’s family daily active users (DAP) has grown by 7.5% from 3.19 billion in 2021 to 3.43 billion now. The company benefits from its AI initiatives aimed at enhancing advertising. It also intends to leverage AI for generating more content. Not only has the company’s sales improved in the past three years, but its net income margin has expanded from 29% in 2023 to 39% currently. Meta’s outstanding shares have also decreased by 1% over this timeframe, largely due to the $63 billion the company invested in share buybacks since 2023. The rise in revenues combined with margin expansion and fewer shares has resulted in the company’s net profit of $25.58 now, an increase of 72% from $14.87 in 2023. Investors are increasingly optimistic about Meta’s stock, and rightly so. The company is experiencing a healthy increase in both ad impressions and the average price per ad, which directly enhances its sales. A significant factor driving this optimism is Meta’s proactive investment in AI. This is not merely a trendy term for Meta; AI is significantly contributing to heightened advertising revenues by: Meta is deeply incorporating generative AI throughout its entire social media ecosystem. This includes innovative features such as the Meta AI virtual assistant for chat, advanced image generation, and robust photo editing tools. Moreover, its Llama AI model is quickly gaining a substantial user base, further solidifying its leadership in AI. These potent growth drivers, coupled with Meta’s improving profitability—evidenced by a solid 39% net income margin—have significantly enhanced investor confidence. Consequently, the company’s Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio has notably expanded from 6.9x trailing revenues in 2023 to 10.6x currently. Indeed, META stock has performed well since the start of 2024. Nonetheless, the rise in META stock has not been steady. The stock’s returns were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, returns for the S&P 500 were 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 23% in 2024 — suggesting that META underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has successfully outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current uncertain macroeconomic environment characterized by trade disputes, interest rate adjustments, and geopolitical tensions, could META find itself in a situation similar to that of 2021 and 2022, potentially underperforming the S&P over the next twelve months — or will it experience a strong upturn? From a valuation perspective, we believe that Meta’s stock is currently fully valued. Our evaluation places Meta Platforms’ valuation at $702 per share, which is quite close to its current market price. The stock is currently trading at 10.6 times its trailing revenues, noticeably higher than its four-year average Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 6.8x. While a slight increase in Meta’s valuation multiple appears reasonable given its recent strong advertising growth, investors should also take into account the inherent risks. The exact impact that AI will have on the company’s long-term earnings growth remains uncertain. This uncertainty renders Meta’s ongoing, aggressive investments in AI a potential risk factor. For context, Meta has already invested $77 billion in capital expenditures since 2023, and it intends to allocate an additional $64 to $72 billion this year alone for AI infrastructure. While META stock seems fully valued, it is useful to examine how Meta Platform’s peers perform on important metrics.

For its flagship crypto ETFs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), BlackRock’s goal is to lead their respective categories by AUM. IBIT has already secured the top spot among spot Bitcoin ETFs, managing over $73 billion in assets as of June 11.

June 12, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Here’s Why You Should Be Wary Of 401(k) Crypto Options

ByChris Carosa ByChris Carosa, Senior Contributor. It seems you can’t avoid crypto. It’s everywhere. In ads. On X posts. And, maybe soon, in your 401(k). But is that a good thing? If you’re thinking of dipping your toe into this undeniable buzz, it’s crucial you conduct a little due diligence. Professional fiduciaries have been pondering the enigma wrapped in a mystery that calls itself cryptocurrency. What are their feelings about this highly volatile and complex digital asset? Why have so many been so reticent about adding this asset class to portfolios? How might their thoughts inform you? Like any other hot investment, you only see the headlines trumpeting the good news. After all, no one ever goes to a cocktail party and enthusiastically brags, “You won’t believe how much money I lost on this stock!” The truth is, what goes up often goes down. And what goes up dramatically can just as quickly go down dramatically. It’s this downside that most alarms (or should alarm) retirement savers. For this reason, the Department of Labor issued a release in 2022 that told 401(k) plan sponsors to proceed carefully before offering investment options based on digital currencies. “The DOL’s Compliance Assistance Release No. 2022-01 cautioned plan fiduciaries to use extreme care when deciding whether to offer 401(k) plan participants cryptocurrency investment options,” says Michelle Capezza, of counsel at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. in New York City. “EBSA raised many concerns, including the possibility of fraud, the speculative and volatile nature of these investments, valuation, custodial and recordkeeping challenges, and difficulty for participants to make informed decisions. EBSA also warned about conducting investigations of plans that offered such investment options and questioned plan fiduciaries on their decisions to offer them in the plan. So, even though financial institutions brought products to market to facilitate these investments, including through digital asset accounts designed to address custody and cybersecurity issues, and through brokerage window models, the DOL guidance had a chilling effect on many plan fiduciaries and raised questions concerning whether they were subject to a new, heightened standard of extreme care review for cryptocurrency investments.” Set aside the idea that this is about digital assets. Think instead about highly volatile stocks. As you approach retirement, you’re more appreciative of certainty. The last thing you want is for your retirement savings to take a sudden drop just when you need to start withdrawing funds. That’s the way fiduciaries think. They look out for what’s best for you. It’s what being prudent is all about. Now, there are those who feel it’s one thing for a professional you willingly hire to take that demeanor. On the other hand, having the government tell you what to do? That just rankles some the wrong way. In effect, the DOL’s 2022 advice merely reiterated what every fiduciary should always do. When the DOL recently rescinded that ruling, it did not remove that duty. The hurdles for adding cryptocurrency to 401(k) investment menus remain today as they always have. “DOL has now issued Compliance Assistance Release 2025-01, formally rescinding the prior release and, importantly, reaffirming for fiduciaries the legal framework governing the evaluation of what particular investments should be included within a 401(k) plan,” says Max Fuller, senior director of government solutions, TaxBit in Denver, Colorado. “While the rescission is great, I am not sure it will result in the floodgates being opened for direct crypto investment within 401(k) plans just yet.” It is this “extreme care” requirement that has fiduciaries walking on eggshells. “The new guidance opens up a Pandora’s box of questions,” says Lyle Himebaugh, managing partner at GGA Retirement in Stamford, Connecticut. “The first question is liability. I would imagine that most 3(38) investment fiduciaries are not equipped to do due diligence and therefore would not take on the liability.” If fiduciaries continue to shy away from crypto, does that raise a red flag for you? Sure, they might be more concerned about potential liabilities than you might be. But that’s precisely where the red flag pops up. Why? The purpose of 401(k) plans is to provide long-term growth and, eventually, stability. This clashes with the inherent volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. The crypto risk magnifies as you approach retirement. But you can realize it at any age. “Given turnover rates and the volatility of closing prices, there is considerable risk that participants would realize a loss when assets are distributed at separation,” says J. M. “Jack” Towarnicky, of counsel at Koehler Fitzgerald, LLC in Powell, Ohio. This is the big challenge with cryptocurrencies. They’re on 24/7. If you invest in them, you’ll have to be on your toes, ever watchful of what’s happening in their markets. With digital assets like these, there are no “closing bells.” Their prices can move at any time, day or night. Still, the positive shift in the regulatory tone means crypto fans may advocate for these investments to be included in their 401(k) plans. While plan sponsors may bow to these demands, their service providers are likely to remain skeptical. “I am sure some investment fiduciaries will put them in the plan,” says Himebaugh, “but there are so many unforeseen and incalculable risks that it will have a mild impact.” Because of these issues, don’t be surprised if digital assets fail to become a mainstream 401(k) option as quickly as some hope. For one thing, it’s not just a decision of whether to include them, it’s how to include them. “The challenges will the same as any asset class consideration,” says Jason Grantz, CEO of Integrated Pension Group in Highland Park, New Jersey. “They’ll have to prudently decide that having crypto available in plans is in the best interest of the participants, without conflict and not solely to appease a small handful of employees who might be clamoring for it. If the asset class does get added, the second hurdle will be even more daunting, which is to decide on which crypt or to simply offer a crypto fund, and that will need to pass Investment Policy criteria like other fund offerings.” There’s clearly retail interest in digital assets. It would not be a surprise if that interest spills over into the 401(k) realm. The rescission of the DOL’s 2022 advice makes it harder for plan sponsors and their advisers to quickly rule out including cryptocurrency products on the plan’s investment menu. The new DOL guidance, however, doesn’t remove the best interest standards when evaluating the appropriateness of adding such investments to retirement plans. “Fiduciaries now face the usual significant challenges in evaluating cryptocurrencies for 401(k) plans,” says Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA in Beverly Hills, California. “Issues like volatility, valuation uncertainty, custody risks, and changing regulatory oversight will be the focus, although each of these respective topics are making massive strides. The primary challenge fiduciaries will now face is a lack of experience in the cryptocurrency market itself, as demand from their clients increases. Many retail investors, 401(k) investors in particular, are looking for a solution that offers the unmatched upside of the crypto market with a minimized risk profile.” Are professional fiduciaries the only ones wary of 401(k) crypto? Like annuities, the actual interest in these investments may be smaller than headlines would suggest. “Prior to the 2022 guidance,” says Towarnicky, “according to a GAO report, no surveyed 401(k) plan had added crypto as a core option, or a window to a crypto asset trading program, and less than 6 in 10,000 401(k) plans (about 300 total) offered crypto via self-directed brokerage windows.” The regulatory bias against 401(k) crypto may be lifting, but that doesn’t mean the fog has dissipated. The underlying risks remain significant. While the DOL has removed its heavy hand, it has not eliminated the fiduciary duty that goes with ERISA plans. Cryptocurrencies expose investors to extreme volatility and difficult pricing mechanisms. The potential for losses at distribution is very real. Does that mean you shouldn’t invest a portion of your retirement assets in them? As with all investments, the decision depends on your individual circumstances. Making prudent decisions is the key, as the elements surrounding both your personal conditions and the cryptocurrency market are ever-changing.

Title: The World’s Largest Technology Companies 2025: Nvidia Continues To Soar Amid AI Boom

ByRashi Shrivastava ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Nvidia's cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang is worth an estimated $125 billion thanks to its stock's rapid rise. The whiplash growth of artificial intelligence has minted a gaggle of billionaires and unicorns, but chip behemoth Nvidia continues to remain among the largest beneficiaries of the AI boom against all odds. The company took a hit on the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market after the Trump administration placed export controls on its H20 chips, which “effectively closed” the market to the U.S. industry, CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent earnings call. Earlier this year its stock briefly nosedived after Chinese darkhorse DeepSeek’s popular AI model launch triggered a panic sell-off. Despite challenges—external and internal—the $3.5 trillion (market cap) juggernaut has continued to capitalize on the global demand for AI infrastructure. In its latest quarterly earnings in May, Nvidia beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations and reported $44.06 billion in revenue, up 69% from a year ago. A hefty portion of its business growth, $39.1 billion of its revenue, comes from its data center operations as the company plans to build “AI factories” in the US and internationally that will help billions of people across the world run AI tools like ChatGPT. In late May, Nvidia said it will supply its powerful silicon chips to Stargate UAE, a joint project with OpenAI, Oracle and others to build a 1 gigawatt “compute cluster” in Abu Dhabi's AI campus. Such projects have helped push the company to the top 100 on Forbes’ Global 2000 ranking the world’s largest public companies. It’s now at position No. 47, 63 spots higher than last year, thanks to a period of strong business growth spurred by widespread use of generative AI. The company is now among the likes of massive tech conglomerates like Tencent (No. 37) and Taiwan Semiconductor (No. 38). The Global 2000 measures market value, revenue, profit and assets equally using the last 12 months of data as of April 25, 2025. Even as AI companies have shifted from training large language models to building applications on top of them, they require a steady supply of Nvidia's powerful silicon chips called graphics processing units (GPUs) to do what’s called inference— where a model produces an answer based on new information fed to it in real time. To top that, new so-called “reasoning AI models” that take a step-by-step approach to answer complex problems consume 100 times more computational resources, creating more demand for Nvidia’s hardware. While Nvidia is the market leader, other companies are growing as well. Semiconductor company Micron, which builds memory and data storage products, has hopped more than 400 spots on the list and is now at No. 228. And South Korean memory chip provider SK Hynix Inc is up 419 spots to No. 155. But not all semiconductor companies have benefited from the AI frenzy. Silicon Valley stalwart Intel, now at No. 488, dropped 381 spots on the Forbes’ Global 2000 this year. The company has struggled after a string of woes including declining revenue, leadership challenges and losing its market share to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Arm Holdings. In December 2024, Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down, and was replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March 2025. In April, the company said its plans to lay off 20% of its staff, Bloomberg reported. The largest tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have all made gigantic bets on artificial intelligence, throwing billions of dollars and the best engineers to develop AI models and build products for their users. Those four firms are all among the top 20 of the Global 2000. South Korean conglomerate Samsung is the only tech giant based overseas in the top 20, moving up to 19th this year. One new AI beneficiary to watch is CoreWeave, which rents cloud computing power to customers and went public in March. It’s making its first appearance on the list at 1,799th this year and is likely to move up fast. It’s not profitable yet, but after the data was compiled for this year’s Global 2000 on April 25, it reported $982 million in first quarter revenue, a 420% increase compared with the first quarter last year, and its stock price has surged 250%.

Title: The Diplomat, The Oligarch, The FBI Agent: Russian-American Faces Trial In Deripaska Sanctions Case
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2025/06/russia-250612-rferl01.htm
Time Published: 2025-06-12T09:13:47Z
Full Content:
By Mike Eckel June 12, 2025 When one of the FBI's top counterintelligence agents was arrested in January 2023, charged with doing illegal work for sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, the US national security community was stunned. Retired by then, Charles McGonigal, who had spent the latter part of his career investigating Russian spies and oligarchs, ultimately pleaded guilty, and was sentenced that December to more than four years in prison. He wasn't the only person implicated by US authorities in the Deripaska case. After more than 16 months of delays and postponements, Sergei Shestakov, a former Soviet and Russian diplomat who became a naturalized US citizen and later worked as an authorized US court interpreter, is set to go on trial on June 17, on charges similar to those McGonigal faced. Like McGonigal, Shestakov is accused of conspiring to help Deripaska evade US sanctions imposed on him in 2018, as well as conspiring to commit money laundering. Shestakov, who was arrested at the same time as McGonigal, is also accused of lying to FBI agents. The trial, and the pretrial legal wrangling, have drawn less attention, mainly because Shestakov is less well known than McGonigal. Until his retirement in 2018 from the FBI's New York office, McGonigal was at the vanguard of the bureau's efforts to track Russian spies and oligarchs, including Deripaska. In addition to being business partners, Shestakov and McGonigal, along with another Russian man, are linked to another former Russian tycoon, Vladimir Gusinsky, who for many years spent most of his time at a Connecticut mansion. Gusinsky has not been implicated in the criminal case against Shestakov and McGonigal. However, he has drawn the interest of the FBI, with agents twice questioning his now estranged wife and employees of the couple's Connecticut household about his relationship to them. Gusinsky was introduced to McGonigal by Shestakov and socialized with them both. Shestakov has pleaded innocent to the charges. According to extensive filings in US federal court in Manhattan, Shestakov's defense hinges in part on the question of whether the work he and McGonigal did was for the benefit of Deripaska or for his massive holding conglomerate, EN+ Group, which controls one of the world's largest aluminum companies, Rusal. Key to that defense is an EN+ employee named Yevgeny Fokin, who the FBI alleges is an agent with Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service. Shestakov's defense lawyer, Rita Glavin, has said in court filings that Fokin can provide evidence that the work Shestakov and McGonigal were hired to do was on behalf of EN+ and involved lobbying to help advocate for the Deripaska companies, which is largely allowed under US law. Glavin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors have alleged Fokin was an "unindicted co-conspirator" with Shestakov and McGonigal. The FBI surveilled, photographed, and secretly recorded him beginning in July 2019, according to court records, and his US visa was revoked in 2022 at the behest of the bureau. Prosecutors have skirmished with Glavin over deposing Fokin, who lives in Russia, where he works as a top adviser to Deripaska at EN+. He has refused to travel to the United States for any reason, according to court filings, fearing possible arrest. After negotiations on whether to depose Fokin in Turkey or Dubai, the two sides agreed that Fokin will testify by videoconference during the trial. Fokin did not respond to e-mails from RFE/RL seeking comment. Among some Russian-speaking circles in the New York City region, Shestakov was known as a fixer, a troubleshooter, and a charmer. A naturalized US citizen who previously worked for the Soviet and Russian foreign ministries, Shestakov retired to the New York area in 1993. In the 2010s, he worked as an authorized interpreter for US federal courts and for the US attorneys' offices for Manhattan and Brooklyn. Shestakov's relationship with Fokin dates back to the 1980s, and both have been employed by Gusinsky. As recently as 2019, Shestakov had a credit card under Gusinsky's name that he used to buy, among other things, thousands of dollars' worth of tickets to professional ice hockey games. Gusinsky did not respond to e-mails seeking comment. Shestakov introduced McGonigal to Fokin sometime in 2018, according to the indictment. That April, Deripaska was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department "for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation." EN+ and Rusal were designated for sanctions at the same time. One of Russia's wealthiest men, Deripaska minted his fortunes in the chaotic 1990s, when insider businessmen fought pitched and often bloody battles for control over the country's industrial giants, such as aluminum production. He's considered a textbook example of an oligarch: a businessman with vast wealth who also has close ties to President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. He's also been on the radar screen of US law enforcement for decades, going back at least as far as 2006, when he was denied a visa to enter the United States. The visa difficulties led him to enlist Republican-linked lobbying firms, and in the late 2010s, he invested in projects with Paul Manafort, the Republican operative who briefly managed President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In September 2022, Deripaska was indicted on charges of trying to evade US sanctions. The charges include allegations that he arranged for his pregnant girlfriend to travel to the United States to give birth so that their child would be a US citizen. Sanctions against EN+ Group and Rusal were lifted in 2019 after Deripaska agreed to distance himself from ownership of the companies. He remains under sanction. US authorities allege Fokin hired McGonigal and Shestakov to research compromising information on Vladimir Potanin, another Russian oligarch and metals tycoon who is a rival of Deripaska. McGonigal, who retired from the FBI in late 2018, also sought to secure an internship for Fokin's daughter at the New York City Police Department, something that raised eyebrows in the department. McGonigal told authorities he was trying to cultivate Fokin as a possible double agent, according to court papers. In late November 2021, FBI agents seized Shestakov's electronic devices. Days earlier, he was questioned about his relationship with Fokin and asked about whether he had ever done any business with him. "No, no business," he told the FBI, according to court documents.

Title: Musk Pins Tesla’s Comeback on Robotaxis After Retreat From Feud

Tesla Inc. already had a lot riding on its highly anticipated robotaxi launch long before Elon Musk decided to swing a wrecking ball through his alliance with President Donald Trump — and the company’s share price. Now investors are looking for a win that can help repair the brand damage and shift Tesla back into growth mode. Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22, as part of the EV maker’s big bet on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. While Tesla gave the city an outline of its tentative plans, the company hadn’t disclosed a launch date — either publicly or directly to Austin officials — until late on Tuesday, when Musk warned the service’s debut could shift because it was “super paranoid about safety.” The proclamation came as part of an all-night series of social media messages by Musk, which included a near-apology that “I regret some of my posts” about the president, which “went too far.” The comments helped push shares up about 3% Wednesday by investors who have been urging Musk to refocus on his business empire. The billionaire has said the rollout would start slowly, with 10 to 20 vehicles, and a testing area verified by Bloomberg News suggests the initial contours of the debut resemble more of a souped-up demo than a full-fledged launch. That may not matter to Tesla’s biggest fans, or the stock price. Investors generally have been willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt in the short term as they believe in his long-term vision. For the moment, Tesla sales are tumbling around the world, its stock is down around 20% this year and analysts have lowered their expectations for the company’s performance. While Musk tries to undo some of the damage from his meltdown with Trump, the immediate impact to Tesla’s shares and Musk’s own wealth shows just how delicate the whole balance is. The government has outsized influence over his businesses, from billion-dollar contracts to the regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles and Tesla’s robotaxi network. “He needs to dial down the rhetoric and the drama and get back to the business of Optimus and robotaxi and Full Self Driving,” Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, told Bloomberg Television. “That is what people own the stock for — and for his brilliance and genius of course — but not for the histrionics.” Musk has promised to establish a ride-hailing network that is part “Airbnb, part Uber.” The company wants the fleet to built on its Full Self-Driving technology and eventually feature both purpose-built Cybercabs without pedals or steering wheels, as well as Teslas owned by the company and individual drivers. Musk predicts hundreds of thousands of the vehicles on the road by late 2026. The robotaxi launch is the first step in showing investors he can deliver. Tesla will be the fourth robotaxi service to launch in Austin in the past several years. While Tesla can operate its standard consumer models in Texas with no driver, it needs federal exemptions to use the Cybercab in its fleet. In other states, including California, Tesla faces a patchwork of regulations. Representatives for Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. There have been signs of the company’s preparation in Austin. Model Y vehicles with manufacturer’s plates have become a frequent sight around town in the south and southeast portions of the city that are studded with residential neighborhoods and retail shopping centers and a few minutes drive from downtown. In some cases, the vehicles drive around in what appear to be circular routes. The initial operation area will likely cover only a few square miles, according to a person familiar with the plan who was not authorized to speak publicly on it. The zone could change before launch or be amended quickly after the service begins. The rules governing driverless vehicles in Texas are notably light. While rideshare companies with human drivers must obtain a license to operate in Texas, a legal loophole means robotaxis like those operated by Tesla don’t need the same approvals, according to the Texas Department of Licensing and Registration. That makes the statea popular choice for companies in the early stages of autonomous service. Waymo, the driverless-rideshare business owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., currently has about 100 robotaxis in Austin in partnership with Uber and plans to ramp up to hundreds over time. Volkswagen ADMT and Amazon.com Inc.’s Zoox are testing their vehicles there. A number of autonomous trucking companies are also testing elsewhere in the state. Tesla has embraced a different approach to autonomy, favoring a camera-only system rather than a combination of lidar, radar and pre-mapping that competitors use. Musk has long claimed such an approach will allow the company to scale up sooner than rivals including Waymo, which he considers too expensive. According to some estimates, Tesla’s system of sensors costs about $400 per vehicle; Waymo’s fleet, which totals 1,500 vehicles in California, Arizona and Texas, runs roughly $9,300 per car. Critics have said Tesla’s vision-only system is riskier as it’s more limited in certain conditions with less visibility, such as sun glare, fog or dust. Regardless of the vehicles’ specifications, autonomous vehicle testing in Austin and elsewhere has brought challenges. General Motors Co.’s now-defunct Cruise dragged a person along a street in San Francisco in a gruesome incident that left the pedestrian in critical condition. Driverless rideshare cars have caused viral traffic jams in Austin and last week, Waymo drove into a flooded area following a storm. “Safety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and those with whom we share the streets. We remain committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience,” a Waymo spokesperson said. In preparation for its launch, Tesla has been in touch with Austin city officials and first responders to discuss safety expectations, according to emails seen by Bloomberg News that date back to at least May 2024. Tesla has said robotaxis will be remotely monitored initially. But several key aspects of Tesla’s plan are yet to be finalized with the city’s autonomous vehicle working group, which communicates with AV companies operating in Austin. Tesla has only shown officials a draft of an expected first responder guide, and an emergency training is still outstanding, according to Andre Jordan, division chief of homeland security and special operations for the Austin Fire Department, and a member of the city’s working group. “Autonomous vehicles are required to follow the law, but what happens when the law and directions of first responders conflict? It’s a complicated world,” said Jordan. It’s also a complicated moment for Musk to pitch Tesla as a trusted brand to take passengers, many of whom aren’t accustomed to riding in self-driving cars, where they need to go. Thanks to months wading through the political fracas in Washington, the billionaire and his cars have never been more polarizing. Although Musk has sought to dial down the hostility with the president, the billionaire’s public spat with Trump threatens to alienate even more customers. “Tesla at this moment is a brand with all sorts of mixed associations,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “If people have negative feelings about Elon Musk and they spill onto robotaxi, I don’t think they’ll be eager to take a ride. There’s lots of alternatives.” Driverless vehicles require an extra element of trust and critics will be ready to amplify any mishaps, said Mike Paul, president of crisis consultancy Reputation Doctor LLC. “When you’re starting from a deficit currently, from a trust in branding perspective, with all things Elon,” Paul said, “it’s going to be very difficult to show success.” Musk has been building expectations for this launch for years. While some investors are willing to lend him some leniency on timing and the exact details, many want concrete signs of progress. Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Tesla to neutral, citing, in part, overhyped expectations from Musk around the robotaxi launch and intensifying competition in the space. Kallo also said that Musk’s deteriorating relationship with Trump has led to more uncertainty. “The valuation has gotten ahead of itself around the robotaxi,” Kallo told Bloomberg Television. “I do think the rollout will take longer. At first it will require more people, so people in control centers making sure that the cars do not get into accidents something like that.” For that reason, Kallo said there will likely be some short-term pain. “Rolling this out will be very difficult.” Topics Tesla

June 12, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: PayPoint plc PayPoint plc PayPoint PlcResults for the year ended 31 March 2025 Further progress towards £100m EBITDA by end of FY26 New targets established for the Group for the next three years, including share buyback programme increased and extended to at least £30 million per annum till the end of FY28 GROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Nick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint Plc, said: “This has been another year of progress for PayPoint where we have delivered a resilient financial performance and made further significant steps towards delivering £100m EBITDA by the end of FY26. These results reflect both the resilience of our businesses in the current challenging economic environment and the impact of our growing capabilities as we unlock further opportunities and growth across our four business divisions. Looking ahead, in addition to our existing target of £100m EBITDA for the current year, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, underlining our confidence in the future growth prospects of the business: achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group; establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our plan; and delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital through an enhanced share buyback programme, consistent with a prudent capital structure and leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x. We have had an encouraging start to the current financial year in each of our business divisions and have already secured a number of important new contract wins, particularly within the Housing sector. In addition to our focus on the organic building blocks for growth, significant energy is being directed into: building strong new business pipelines, particularly in Love2shop Business, Housing and Charities; successful delivery of our Local Banking service, with at least two banks due to go live in H1; continued parcels growth, driving volume opportunities with each carrier and growing Out of Home consumer adoption; optimising our retailer network performance, through better adoption of services, our new Store Growth Specialist team and further site growth; and the further upselling of our enhanced payment capabilities into our existing client base, including utilities. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and the execution of our plan to deliver strong earnings growth and cash flow generation, combined with a sustainable dividend policy, provide a robust platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns through an increased and extended share buyback programme of at least £30 million per annum till the end of March 2028, all underpinned by our confidence and clear operational plans to deliver further progress in the current year and our £100m EBITDA target.” SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME INCREASED AND EXTENDED Today the Group announces its intention to increase and extend its 3-year share buyback programme (the “Buyback Programme”). This enhanced Buyback Programme reflects the strong cash generative nature of the Group, along with the Board’s confidence in delivering on our growth targets for FY26-FY28 and in-line with our commitment to enhance shareholder returns. The Buyback Programme will be increased with a plan to return at least £30 million per annum to shareholders and will be extended until the end of March 2028, with the target of reducing our equity base by at least 20% over that period. We will continue to review the Buyback Programme based on business performance, market conditions, cash generation and the overall capital needs of the business. Throughout this period, we will continue to increase dividends at a nominal rate and, as a result of our continued financial performance, grow our cover ratio from the current 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings range to over 2.0 times earnings by FY28. Combined with the increased and extended Buyback Programme, this dividend policy will enhance shareholder returns and ensure the business continues to maintain an efficient capital structure, balancing an appropriate leverage ratio of around 1.2 to 1.5 times net debt/EBITDA with the overall capital needs of the business. DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Shopping divisional net revenue increased by 1.2% to £65.2 million (FY24: £64.4 million) E-commerce divisional net revenue increased strongly by 39.0% to £16.4 million (FY24: £11.8 million) Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 1.7% to £54.4 million (FY24: £53.5 million) Love2shop divisional net revenue increased by 0.8% to £51.7 million (FY24: £51.3 million) BUILDING BLOCKS FOR GROWTH In the current financial year, the Group remains focused on executing against the seven building blocks for growth to the end of FY28: RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NUMBERS BUSINESS DIVISION NET REVENUE AND MIX A presentation for analysts is being held at 9.30am today (12 June 2025) via webcast. This announcement, along with details for the webcast, is available on the PayPoint Plc website: paypointbusiness.com/corporate CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW GROUP UPDATE Resilient financial performance with further progress towards delivering £100m EBITDA by the end of FY26 This has been another year of progress for PayPoint where we have delivered a resilient financial performance and made further significant steps towards delivering £100m EBITDA by the end of FY26. These results reflect both the resilience of our businesses in the current challenging economic environment and the impact of our growing capabilities as we unlock further opportunities and growth across our four business divisions. Targets for the Group to the end of FY28 While we remain focused on the delivery of our current target of £100m EBITDA by the end of FY26, looking further ahead, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, reflecting our confidence in the growth prospects of the business and our continued commitment to delivering enhanced returns for our shareholders: 1. Achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the GroupOur strategy over the past five years to transform the business and its capabilities from our legacy cash bill payments history has created a more robust and higher organic growth platform. We believe a combination of our business mix today and the opportunities in each of our key building blocks for growth supports a consistent, underlying net revenue growth rate in the range of 5-8% per annum. 2. Establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our planAn important next step to support the delivery of this growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, we have sought the support of Nile, an independent consultancy, in a project to review our operational structure and business processes today and develop a plan to deliver greater automation and business agility in the future to support the delivery of our plan. 3. Delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital, with scope for leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5xThe actions we are taking to deliver sustained organic growth across the business in a more efficient and agile business structure will further enhance the core cash generative characteristics of the business, enabling an accelerated share buyback programme over the next three years within a prudent capital structure of leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x REVIEW BY DIVISION SHOPPING DIVISION In Retail Services, our core focus is to continue the growth of our retailer estate and to drive a consistently higher level of adoption of our service proposition. We remain committed to supporting our retailer partners drive more revenue and to maximising the opportunities from our unparalleled portfolio of community services. The next stage of that commitment is the recent rollout of a Store Growth Specialist team, dedicated to supporting retailers to unlocking more commission opportunities and enabled by targeted data and analytics to ensure we are focusing our efforts in the right locations. Early indications from this rollout have been very positive in terms of demonstrable performance optimisation and services adoption. In addition, we continue to drive further engagement with our Retailer Rewards scheme, launched in September 2024, giving retailers additional commission for scanning goods in store. Our next generation device, PayPoint Mini, continues to rollout across our estate with 2,898 now live, along with our integrated third-party EPoS solution, PayPoint Connect. We also now have structured plans in place to support our multiple retailer partners in maximising the value of our wide portfolio of services in their stores, including the rollout of additional Collect+ sites, FMCG campaigns, Love2shop gift cards and our new Local Banking service. Our FMCG consumer engagement proposition, PayPoint Engage, continues to gain good traction delivering campaigns for major consumer brands, leveraging our PayPoint One platform, advertising screens and vouchering capability. Over 18 campaigns have been delivered in the year, including an award-winning campaign for Spar during Euro 2024, with a building pipeline of further brand campaigns for delivery over the next 12 months. In Cards, we have focused in the year on delivering a successful transition to Lloyds Bank Cardnet as an acquiring partner across the wider Group, with the partnership launching in December 2024 into our Handepay business. The partnership has enhanced our merchant proposition, including earlier in the day settlement, and delivered an enhanced and faster onboarding for our merchants. Additionally, we have launched our Merchant Mobile App, enabling merchants to access transaction data and insights about their business, with over 3,000 merchants already signed up and plans in place for further growth over the current year. Over the course of the next 12 months, we will be adding further features and functionality to the app, including real-time transaction data and the integration of our Rewards scheme. In the period, we have also improved participation in our Handepay Rewards Scheme, with over 3,500 merchants registered, and continued to drive further enhancements to our core proposition, with the launch of a new AI-driven statement reader to further speed up and enhance the merchant sales experience, strengthened pricing governance and time to transact drastically reduced from 14.7 days to 2.2 days, driven by our welcome call programme and an improved customer onboarding process with the new Lloyds Bank Cardnet partnership. All of these actions are focused on driving an improved retention performance in the current year, with a target reduction of churn to 25%. Our Business Finance product, via YouLend, continues to grow with over £23.8m of funding delivered to merchants across the Group in FY25, an increase of 23% versus the prior year, and with plans in place to pilot an Asset Finance product with merchants in H1 FY26. In our Community Cash Access and Banking network, while progress continues to be frustrating, a detailed ATM recovery plan is now underway to improve performance in the current year, including the enablement of Mastercard and Visa throughout the network in H1 FY26, an improved support and maintenance model with Notemachine to drive ATM uptime and service, individual site performance optimisation visits and further network expansion opportunities in progress with new partners. Our Counter Cash service, offering withdrawals and balance enquiries over the counter, is now live in 2,993 locations, and we have processed over £475 million of consumer deposits for our neobank clients in the year. We are also well advanced with the launch of the first two major High St Banks delivering consumer deposits across our extensive network in H1 FY26, which will be followed by an SME deposit solution for High St Banks in development for pilot in H2 FY26. E-COMMERCE DIVISION In E-commerce, we have delivered a record year, with net revenue +39.0% at £16.4 million and parcel transactions growing to 133.4 million. This performance reflects the strong positioning of our growing Collect+ network for Out of Home (OOH) fulfilment with both consumers and carriers and a continuing market shift towards OOH delivery. Our partnership with Royal Mail launched earlier in the financial year, with over 7,500 sites rolled out across the UK and store to store and click and collect services now live. Our longstanding Yodel/Vinted partnership has continued to deliver strong volumes through our Store-to-Store service, with growing adoption by consumers and our carrier partners. We have also expanded our Zebra printer technology to over 93% of our network, underlining our continuing commitment to invest in improving the consumer experience in store and driving further adoption of Out of Home (OOH) with our carrier partners. As referred to in our interim results in November 2024, we made a strategic investment in Yodel alongside other investors, including InPost in June 2024. As we indicated at the time, our investment was in support of the Yodel management team as they planned to further automate and modernise the Yodel business. Since this initial investment, InPost has provided Yodel with significant additional funding and announced their acquisition of Yodel on 17 April 2025, resulting in a significant dilution of our original investment to a 4.5% minority stake in the business and a write down of the investment to £2.2 million. An expansion of InPost PUDO locations has also recently been announced, growing to over 6,000 sites, which harmonises locations, parcel volumes and opening up the opportunity for further expansion and parcel volume growth across our extensive network for both InPost and Yodel. We have now established new partnerships with Chinese and South Asian marketplaces, with the initial rollout of 26 stores with SFExpress, the leading integrated logistics service provider with an extensive PUDO network in China, focused on enabling our services in Chinese communities across the UK. We continue to explore further opportunities to build increased momentum and drive further volume into our network, with the primary focus to establish Collect+ as the first-choice partner for Pick Up Drop Off (PUDO) with these marketplaces. We have successfully grown the Collect+ network to 14,213 sites in new locations and demographics, including increasing our presence with major multiple retailers like One Stop, Spar NI owned by Henderson Group and a pilot with Asda, rolling out further sites for the Royal Mail, InPost and UPS, and growing our student presence working with 19 of the top universities and student unions across the UK (Strathclyde, Aberdeen, Sunderland and Open University added in the year). We will continue to identify opportunities to grow the Collect+ network across a number of new and existing channels, in partnership with our carriers and consistent with developing consumer behaviours and needs in the Out of Home market. PAYMENTS & BANKING DIVISION In Payments & Banking, our integrated digital payments platform, MultiPay, continues to establish itself as a comprehensive payment solution for clients across card processing, Open Banking, direct debit and cash, with net revenue growth of 4.5% year on year. We have secured further strong wins in the Housing sector, with Guinness Housing, Sovereign and Thirteen, and in the Charity sector with several Citizen’s Advice regional offices, Alzheimer’s Society, Shelter and Wiltshire and Bath Air Ambulance. A major focus for the current year is on increasing opportunities to cross-sell payments services within our existing client base, leveraging our wider multichannel payments platform and Open Banking capabilities. We have also completed our first full year of delivering the DVLA International Driving Permit service, which went live on 1 April 2024, marking another key central government service fulfilled via our extensive retailer network. In our cash through to digital category, we have made the key decision to build on our success and market positioning in the cash through to digital sector, by combining our leading portfolio of consumer brands, including Amazon, Netflix, Deliveroo and Uber, with physical Love2shop gift cards in store. This creates a strong consumer proposition, offering the choice of specific cash through to digital brands and our Love2shop multi-retailer redemption card, which is expected to generate meaningful additional card load and revenue opportunities for retailer partners. The strength of this proposition is evidenced by the sales momentum built with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, establishing an annual run rate of circa £1m of value processed, and the early success of our partnership with InComm Payments offering Love2shop gift cards into a range of major retailers. Following the completion of our majority investment in obconnect in October 2024, we are now making strong progress executing on our strategy in Open Banking. In PayPoint, we are focused on winning business with both new and existing clients delivering Open Banking services and payments channels, all enabled by obconnect and Aperidata, with 28 further clients live in the year for our services, including the Crown Commercial Service. In the year, the BBC also went live for Confirmation of Payee. In obconnect, the focus is on providing the necessary support and expertise to deliver data sharing ecosystems for major banks and jurisdictions, as demonstrated by the major contract win to deliver the Confirmation of Payee ecosystem for the New Zealand Banking Association which went live successfully in December 2024, including major banks like ANZ, Kiwibank and Westpac. In addition, a major focus for the current year is developing the next generation of Open Banking technology and capability, which will support future pipeline opportunities in this rapidly evolving market. As we indicated at the time of the announcement of the investment in obconnect on 1 August 2024, we have recognised a modest net revenue contribution in H2 FY25 of £1.8 million, in the expectation of a more meaningful contribution in FY26 and thereafter, driven by further pipeline opportunities in Confirmation of Payee, Verification of Payee in Europe and ecosystems in additional jurisdictions. In Cash, legacy energy bill payments net revenue decreased by 6.5% for the year consistent with our expectations, with this part of the business continuing to be resilient, both in transaction volumes, rates and the renewal of a number of key contracts including Scottish Power. We expect this pattern and moderation in the rate of decline to continue into the current year. Over the year, the energy price cap, updated by Ofgem on a quarterly basis, was set for pre-pay customers at £1,643 for April to June 2024, £1,522 for July to September 2024, £1,669 for October to December 2024 and £1,690 for January to March 2025. However, the price cap has increased in the current financial year to £1,803 for pre-pay customers for April to June 2025. LOVE2SHOP DIVISION Overall, the Love2shop division had an excellent year, delivering growth in Love2shop Business, a resilient performance in Park Christmas Savings and strong progress in a number of key initiatives to develop new sales channels and partnerships. In Love2shop Business, we delivered a positive year with £172.2 million of billings delivered (FY24: £162.8 million), benefiting from the excellent planning and preparation by the Love2shop team well in advance of the peak trading period, and the growing benefits from corporate API integrations launched into major clients last year, delivering increased billings and improved customer experience. For our top 10 clients, we saw sales volumes grow by 17% YOY as we continue to develop our relationships, with ourmanaged client portfolio billings retention at 91% and major clients retention at 107%. During our peak trading month of December, we saw a YOY increase in AOV by 11% to £11.5k. Highstreetvouchers.com performance was strong with billings +12.8% ahead of plan, reflecting the benefits of the actions taken at the beginning of the financial year to our online strategy. This positive outcome has been driven by a more efficient use of paid media spend driving a higher Average Order Value (AOV) of £320 vs £92 previously, improved customer journeys optimised for business customers transacting online or wishing to speak to our sales team, and an improved digital product and participation enabling larger bulk orders which has also increased AOV from £400 to £1500. Our expanded distribution partnership with InComm Payments launched successfully on 20 October 2024 and has delivered a strong first six months with over £2.9 million of billings. The partnership has seen a significant expansion of physical Love2shop gift cards into major grocers and High St retailers, with plans already underway to build on this positive start and gain further momentum in FY26. Our sales momentum has also continued to build with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, establishing an annual run rate of circa £1m of value processed. New redemption partners onboarded in the year for Love2shop included Dobbies Garden Centres, Foyles Bookstores, Blackwells, Frankie & Bennys, Las Iguanas and Wilko. Together these initiatives launched over the year have further enhanced consumer recognition of the Love2shop brand through our online and physical in store channels. Park Christmas Savings delivered a solid outcome to the Christmas 2024 campaign with final billings of £162.2m, consistent with the previous year, with average saver value increased by 2.5% versus the prior year and customer retention strong at 91% of value retained from the prior season, all against the backdrop of tighter consumer spending and fluctuating consumer confidence over the year. A key focus in the year has been improving payment to conversion for new customers, which increased by 5% vs prior year delivering an improvement in the number of ‘nil paid’ and ‘off track’ customers. All of this has been achieved by focused saver activity and engagement campaigns leveraging Group capabilities via PayPoint’s PayByLink payment solution. The 2025 savings season has started positively, with gross accounts +18,000 versus the prior year, and the paid order book and cash collected +2% in the season to date. In addition, a new Agent App was launched to support savers and new digital gift cards added to the extensive product portfolio, with ongoing campaigns focused on driving payment to conversion. This again reinforces the enduring appeal and vital role this service plays in helping consumers budget for big occasions and avoid debt, with a Trustpilot rating of 4.6/5 and over £2 million of value delivered to savers each year. We continue to explore new expansion opportunities with a number of potential partners, in which to support further growth of our prepaid savings platform and leverage the strength of this capability. MBL, the leading gift card technology platform that was acquired by Love2shop in 2022, processed £123.2 million in gift card value in in the year (FY24: £59.7 million), reflecting continued momentum as a gift card service provider for Greggs, B&M, New Look, Tapi, and Schuh, and as a key distributor for over 150 UK retailers' gift cards. We continue to expand the range of MBL solutions that we offer to our corporate clients and grow gift card management services with more retailers. UPDATE ON CLAIMS AGAINST PAYPOINT In FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received two claims relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem’s concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. The first claim was served by Utilita Energy Limited and Utilita Services Limited (subsequently renamed Luxion Sales Limited) (“Utilita”) on 16 June 2023. The second claim was served by Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (“Global 365”) on 18 July 2023. On 14 May 2025, PayPoint and Utilita came to a settlement such that Utilita has withdrawn its claim against PayPoint. As part of this settlement, the two parties have agreed to a new 5-year contract for over-the-counter prepayment services. PayPoint is looking forward to the opportunity to build a more collaborative and mutually supportive relationship with Utilita going forward. PayPoint remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365 at trial. The claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, started on 10 June 2025. OUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND The continued progress and momentum established across the Group, particularly with the seven key building blocks, underpins our confidence in delivering our newly established targets for the next three year period to the end of FY28: achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group; establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our plan; and delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital through an enhanced share buyback programme, consistent with a prudent capital structure and leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x. We have had an encouraging start to the current financial year in each of our business divisions and have already secured a number of important new contract wins, particularly within the housing sector. In addition to our focus on the organic building blocks for growth, significant energy is being directed into: building strong new business pipelines, particularly in Love2shop Business, Housing and Charities; successful delivery of our Local Banking service, with at least two banks due to go live in H1; continued parcels growth, driving volume opportunities with each carrier and growing Out of Home consumer adoption; optimising our retailer network performance, through better adoption of services, our new Store Growth Specialist team and further site growth; and the further upselling of our enhanced payment capabilities into our existing client base, including utilities. Our commitment to an increased and extended share buyback programme will enhance shareholder returns and is reflective of our long-term confidence in the business and our underlying cash flow. The Board has declared a final dividend of 19.6p per share, an increase of 2.1% vs the prior year final dividend of 19.2p per share, consistent with our dividend policy and target cover range of 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings excluding exceptional items. We remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year, meeting expectations and achieving our financial goals to FY28. Nick WilesChief Executive 11 June 2025 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS PayPoint Group has identified the following KPIs to measure progress of business performance: FINANCIAL REVIEW OVERVIEW Current year total statutory revenue of £310.7 million is reported after an exceptional deduction of £14.2 million related to a claim settlement. Underlying revenue, excluding this deduction, increased by £18.5 million (6.0%) to £324.9 million. Net revenue increased by £6.7 million (3.7%) to £187.7 million (2024: £181.0 million). Net revenue from the PayPoint segment increased by £6.3 million to £136.0 million (2024: £129.7 million) predominately driven by the growth in e-commerce, with parcel transactions exceeding 130 million in the year, and the 5 months of net revenue contribution from obconnect partially offset by the cash payments decline in Payments & Banking. Total costs increased by £0.4 million to £119.7 million (2024: £119.3 million). The increase in costs includes £1.5 million additional costs from 5 months of contribution of obconnect, together with increases in transactional costs of revenue and depreciation of terminals and devices used to drive revenue in the business, these increases have been partially offset by savings in overheads following the organisational restructure earlier in the year. Exceptional costs of £23.4 million, which are one-off, non-recurring and do not reflect current operational performance, comprises settlement and legal fees incurred as a result of the Group’s defence of claims served against it, costs associated with early exit of a property lease in Love2shop and accelerated amortisation on certain modules of Love2shop ERP systems following the commencement to re-platform key systems. The prior year costs comprise the same legal fees as noted in the current year, restructuring costs and costs associated with refinancing for the Group. During the year the Group remeasured its investments and convertible loan notes resulting in a net charge of £9.6 million in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss for the current year, reported within adjusting items (see note 14). The underlying profit before tax for the Group increased by £6.3 million (10.2%) to £68.0 million (2024: £61.7 million). Profit before tax of £26.3 million (2024: £48.2 million) decreased by £21.9 million (45.4%). Underlying EBITDA increased by £8.7 million to £90.0 million (2024: £81.3 million), which comprises £21.0 million for the L2s segment and £69.0 million for the PayPoint segment. Cash generation increased by £11.1 million to £69.0 million (2024: £57.9 million), delivered from profit before tax of £26.3 million (2024: £48.2 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £10.3 million (2024: £11.8 million) with trade receivables and inventory levels increasing as the Group grows its revenue and supports new revenue generating initiatives which requires increases in working capital. Net corporate debt increased by £29.9 million to £97.4 million (2024: £67.5 million), with cash generation of £69.0 million offset by tax payments, capital expenditure, share buyback, investments and dividends. At 31 March 2025 loans and borrowings were £102.3 million (2024: £93.9 million) PAYPOINT SEGMENT Revenue of £163.6 million includes a £14.2 million exceptional deduction, excluding this underlying revenue increased by £8.1 million to £177.8 million (4.8%). Shopping net revenue increased by £0.8 million (1.2%) to £65.2 million (2024: £64.4 million). Service fees net revenue increased by £2.1 million (10.7%) driven by the implementation of the annual RPI increase and additional PayPoint sites. Cards net revenue decreased by £0.3 million (0.9%), with site growth delivered in the PayPoint retailer estate and a reduction in the Handepay SME partners as we strengthen the field sales team and align to the strong and consistent progress already achieved in the Telesales teams. Lower than anticipated consumer spending has impacted the total value processed through the network which is down 4.2%. ATM and Counter Cash net revenue decreased by £1.0 million (11.4%) due to a reduction in transactions driven by the continuing trend of reduced demand for cash across the economy. E-commerce net revenue increased by £4.6 million (39.0%) to £16.4 million (2024: £11.8 million), driven by strong growth in parcel transactions which increased by 33.3%. This was due to the growing strength in partnerships with InPost and Royal Mail, the investment in the in-store experience with Zebra label printers over the past 18 months and the continued expansion from new services and carrier partners. Payments & Banking net revenue increased by £0.9 million (1.7%) to £54.4 million (2024: £53.5 million). Cash bill payments and top ups revenue decreased by £1.9 million (6.8%) to £25.9 million (2024: £27.8 million) driven by a 18.9% reduction in transactions following the reduced usage of cash and the continued switch to digital payments. Digital net revenue increased by £1.7 million (12.3%) to £15.5 million (2024: £13.8 million) with the current year including 5 months contribution from obconnect partially offset by a reduction in cashout transactions. In addition there was an increase in other Payments & Banking income received from a number of items which are non-recurring in nature. The cost of commission to PayPoint retailers increased by £1.8 million (4.5%) to £41.7 million (2024: £39.9 million). This increase in payment to our retailer partners reflects an increase in the number of E-commerce transactions processed as well as more with higher commission rates per transaction. Total costs (excluding adjusting items) increased by £3.4 million (4.3%) to £82.6 million (2024: £79.2 million), primarily as a result of the depreciation and amortisation impact of investment software and devices and the further investment in our people and field sales team to support growth in sales. SECTOR ANALYSIS SHOPPING Shopping consists of services provided to retailer and SME partners, which contain two sub divisions, Card Services and Retail Services. Services include providing the PayPoint terminal to retailer partners, ATMs and Counter Cash and FMCG vouchering. Net revenue increased by £0.8 million (1.2%) to £65.2 million (2024: £64.4 million) due to the growth in service fees driven by growth in sites and an annual RPI increase . The net revenue of each of our key products is separately addressed below. As at 31 March 2025, PayPoint had a live terminal in 30,712 UK sites, an increase of 5.4% primarily as a result of new PayPoint Mini sales. Service fees: This is a core growth area and consists of service fees from PayPoint terminals. Service fee net revenue increased by £2.1 million (10.7%) to £21.8 million driven by the additional revenue generating sites compared to the prior year. Card services: Card acquiring services generated £21.0 million net revenue in the year, a reduction of £2.3 million from the previous year (2024: £23.3 million). Transaction values overall have decreased by 4.2% to £6,868 million (2024 £7,173 million) following lower than anticipated consumer spending. During the year unprofitable legacy RSM2000 sites have been removed which has reduced revenue and reduced costs. Revenue from terminal rentals has increased by £1.8 million to £10.6 million (2024: £8.8 million) mainly as a result of a change in the sales mix of operating leases compared to finance leases. Operating leases also have associated costs included in the profit and loss account. ATMs and Counter Cash: Net revenue reduced by £1.0 million (11.4%) to £7.8 million (2024: £8.8 million) as transactions reduced by 14.0% to 24.5 million. This is attributable to the continued reduced demand for cash across the economy. ATM and Counter Cash live sites decreased 33.7% to 6,365 following a review to remove non transacting counter cash sites. Other: Other shopping services remained flat at £3.2 million (2024: £3.2 million) E-COMMERCE E-commerce net revenue increased by £4.6 million (39.0%) to £16.4 million following a record year for Collect+ as parcel transactions grew strongly by 33.3% to 133.4 million. This was due to the growing strength in partnerships with InPost and Royal Mail, the investment in the in-store experience with Zebra label printers over the past 18 months . There has been continued expansion from new services, Yodel store to store and Amazon returns, and new carrier partnerships with Royal Mail. Parcel sites increased by 20.6% to 14,213 sites. PAYMENTS & BANKING Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 1.7% to £54.4 million following 5 months of contribution from obconnect included within Digital and higher non-recurring other income. This has been partially offset by fewer cash bill payments and top up transactions. Cash net revenue decreased by £1.9 million (6.8%) to £25.9 million. This is due to a reduction in transactions as consumers move to different payment methods. Digital (obconnect, MultiPay, Cash Out, Open banking) net revenue increased by £1.7 million (12.3%) to £15.5 million. This is mainly due to including £1.8 million revenue from the first 5 months of trading from obconnect. Digital transactions excluding obconnect decreased by 1.9 million (4.1%) to 45.0 million. MultiPay net revenue increased by £0.3 million to £6.7 million (2024: £6.4 million). The DWP Payment Exception Service contributed £3.5 million net revenue in the year (2024: £3.9 million) following the expected decrease in customers. Cashout revenue decreased by £0.4 million (14.0%) to £2.7 million (2024: £3.0 million). Open banking and other revenue increase by £0.3 million (60.0%) to £0.8 million (2024: £0.5 million). Cash through to digital (eMoney) net revenue remained flat at £6.8 million (2024: £6.8 million) and transactions decreased by 0.3 million (3.7%) to 7.9 million (2024: 8.2 million). Other payments & banking net revenue includes interest income from client balances, SIM sales and other ad-hoc items which contributed £6.2 million (2024: £5.1 million) net revenue. The year on year increase is driven by a number of items which are non-recurring in nature. LOVE2SHOP SEGMENT Love2shop (L2s) Segment has generated £367.5 million of total billings in the year (2024: £359.3 million). Net revenue for the year increased £0.4 million to £51.7 million (2024: £51.3 million) as a result of higher interest income and the product mix, partially offset by changing product mix in Prepaid Christmas Savings to drive customer retention and a reduction in prepaid media on lower margin billings which has led to an increased profit contribution. Love2shop achieved £204.5 million of billings in the year, an increase on prior year of £7.9 million (2024: £196.7 million). This increase reflects improved performance in our corporate area, with our established client base achieving record retention and an increase in client order value of 11% during our key peak trading month of December. Included in Love2shop are billings from the distribution partnership with Incomm payments, this went live in October 2024 with a phased rollout. During this phased rollout Love2shop gift cards were sold in over 3,100 unique locations, including leading UK grocers and high street stores for the first time. Through this partnership and our distribution across the PayPoint multiple retailer network gift cards were sold in over 6,000 unique locations in FY25. Park Christmas Savings achieved billings of £163.0 million (2024: £162.6 million), building on prior year channel improvements. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION The income tax charge of £7.0 million (2024: £12.5 million) on profit before tax of £26.3 million (2024: £48.2 million) represents an effective tax rate of 26.6% (2024: 25.9%). This is higher than the UK statutory rate of 25% mainly due to the impact of prior year adjustments. GROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Net assets of £97.3 million (2024: £121.2 million) decreased by £23.9 million reflecting the first year impact of the share buyback programme, the claim settlement and fair value investment adjustments, partially offset by underlying profit after tax. Current assets decreased by £26.0 million to £270.6 million (2024: £296.6 million) due to a reduction in corporate cash and a decrease in the balance for items in the course of collection, an equal but opposite decrease in the settlement payables is included in current liabilities. Non-current assets of £237.8 million (2024: £222.5 million) increased by £15.3 million reflecting the acquisition of obconnect. Total liabilities increased by £13.0 million to £411.0 million (2024: £398.0 million) following an increase in loans and borrowings, offset by a reduction in settlement payables, as noted above. Net corporate debt was £97.4 million (2024: £67.5 million) and has increased by £29.9 million from the previous year. Positive cash generation from trading has been offset by £14.9 million on the share buyback programme, investments in obconnect and Yodel and working capital requirements in the year, along with tax payments, capital expenditure and dividend requirements. Total loans and borrowings were £102.3 million at the year end, increasing by £8.4 million from 31 March 2024. These consisted of a £45.0 million non-amortising term loan, £58.0 million drawdown of the £90.0 million revolving credit facility and £0.3 million of accrued interest less £1.0 million arrangement fees (2024: £36.0 million of amortising term loans, £57.5 million drawdown from the revolving credit facility, and £0.4 million of accrued interest). GROUP CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY The following table summarises the cash flow and net debt movements during the year. Cash generation increased £11.1 million to £69.0 million (2024: £57.9 million) delivered from profit before tax of £26.3 million (2024: £48.2 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £10.3 million (2024: £11.8 million) with trade receivables and inventory levels increasing as the Group grows its revenue and supports new revenue generating initiatives which requires increases in working capital. Taxation payments on account of £11.4 million (2024: £8.4 million) were higher than the prior year, with payments based on a higher estimated profit before tax. Dividend payments were higher compared to the prior year following an increased interim and final ordinary dividend per share from the prior year ended 31 March 2024. The 3-year share buyback programme commenced on 1 July 2024 and returned £14.9 million cash during the year (2024: £nil). Capital expenditure of £18.8 million (2024: £16.2 million) was £2.6 million higher than the prior year. Capital expenditure primarily consists of payment terminals including Zebra printers, IT hardware, card terminals and other software development. The increase in capital expenditure is primarily the result of software development investment to modernise heritage systems. DIVIDENDS We have declared an increase of 2.1% in the final dividend to 19.6 pence per share (2024: 19.2 pence per share) payable in equal instalments of 9.8 pence per share (2024: 9.6 pence per share) on 11 August 2025 and 26 September 2025 to shareholders on the register on 4 July 2025 and 29 August 2025 respectively. The final dividend is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 6 August 2025. The final dividend will result in £13.8 million (2024: £14.0 million) being paid to shareholders from the standalone statement of financial position of the Company which, as at 31 March 2025, had approximately £67.2 million (2024: £102.2 million) of distributable reserves. CAPITAL ALLOCATION The Group maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term that allows a healthy mix of returns to shareholders and cash for investments. The Group’s capital allocation priorities have been updated as follows: GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having regard to the identified principal risks and uncertainties and the viability statement on page 22. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group including dividends. Rob HardingChief Financial Officer 11 June 2025 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Continuous development and review, whilst maintaining a dynamic and effective risk management process, is vital to support the business in achievement of its strategy and business objectives. Risk management continues to be an essential part of PayPoint’s Corporate Governance. Changes to principal risks New risks and disclosures PayPoint’s risk appetite is determined by the Board and aligns the level of risk considered acceptable in achieving our strategic objectives, increasing financial returns and adhering to statutory requirements. Our risk appetite remains the same as last year. It is defined as: Changing risks Credit and Liquidity/Treasury Management – The name of this risk has been updated to reflect the increasing importance of Counter Party Risk Management to the Group which is now included within the risk profile. This risk is considered to be increasing following recent investment activities aligned to our strategic objectives. Operational Model – this risk has been renamed as Client Services to more accurately reflect the composition of this risk and its associated risk management strategy. Other principal risks have remained similar to last year, although they reflect current trends and our risk appetite for each area. Emerging Risks ESG and Climate Risk remains an emerging risk. Whilst we recognise the impact climate change is having globally, we continue to be a low-carbon producing company and, as such, these risks do not pose an immediate risk to our operations. We have embedded a strategy of reducing our carbon emissions, with a goal of becoming fully net-zero by 2040 (2030 for our own operations). Details of how we plan to achieve are set out in our annual report. In 2022 we implemented The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which provides companies with a framework to improve reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities. Risks caused by climate change have been embedded into our enterprise risk management framework including our financial planning processes, business case development and our overall risk identification and management processes are set out in our annual report. The table on pages 18 to 21 sets out our principal and emerging risks and includes: details of the potential impact; mitigation strategies; status of each risk; risk appetite; and exposure trend. They do not comprise all risks faced by the Group and are not set out in order of priority. VIABILITY STATEMENT In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period, taking account of the Group’s current financial and trading position, the principal risks and uncertainties (as set out on pages 18 to 21) and the strategic plans that are reviewed at least annually by the Board. Assessment periodThe Directors have determined that the Group’s strategic planning period of three years remains an appropriate timeframe over which to assess viability. This broadly aligns to average client renewal terms, new client prospecting and onboarding cycles and the development-through-to-maturity evolution of new products and service lines. The current financing facilities are in place until 2029 broadly in line with this period. Assessment of prospectsThe Directors assess the Group’s prospects through the annual strategy day in September 2024 and review of the Group’s three-year Plan in March 2025. The planning process forecasts the Group’s financial performance that include cash flows which allow the Directors to assess both the Group’s liquidity and adequacy of funding. In its assessment of the Group’s prospects, the Directors have considered the following: — The Group’s strategy and how it addresses changing economic environments in the context of our clients, parcel partnerships, merchants, prepay savers and retailer requirements. In each of our business divisions, we evolve our proposition to specifically address the requirements of our clients and merchants. In the e-Commerce division, we continue to extend our network and offer online customers greater convenience driven by the developing partnerships with carriers. In our Shopping division, our partnership with Lloyds Bank is providing a market-leading banking and card services proposition. In Payments and Banking, leveraging our open banking capabilities (obconnect) to cross- and up-sell our multi-channel payment capabilities, bringing innovation to our targeted sectors. In Love2shop, we continue to integrate our products into new channels (Incomm) and extend adoption of the PayPoint OpenPay service enabling consumers the choice of cash or vouchers. Finally, we are expanding our community cash banking solutions across the UK providing much needed access to cash for consumers, through our retailer partners. The Group’s inherent resilience to risk. The Group has an inherent resilience to risk from its diversified proposition across many sectors. This means there are substantial opportunities to continue to provide more key services across all our customers (Retailers, SMEs, Clients, prepay savers and Parcel partnerships). This will ensure we are more integral to all our customers. The business remains highly cash generative, enabling continued investment in key areas of growth to support the Group’s longer-term viability. Expectations of the future economic environment. The economic environment remains uncertain. Higher inflation and cost of borrowing have and continue to impact consumer behaviours and confidence. The diversity and necessity of our proposition ensures the business can adapt to ongoing and unexpected changes. A good example of this is the Yodel/Vinted partnership which supports many value seeking consumers with purchases in the previously loved clothing market. The Group’s financial position. As at 31 May 2025 the Group had £105.7 million of net debt, split £8.7m cash and £114.4 utilised facilities. Compared to the total facility of £165m means the group has substantial headroom of £59.3m. This level of liquidity is sufficient for all viability scenarios. Furthermore, the Group has proven, robust performance and cash generation in previous economic downturns. Assessment of viability To assess our viability, we modelled different scenarios identified by considering the potential impact of the principal risks (as shown in the table on pages 18 to 21). Our development of scenarios included reviewing the risks of PayPoint Group, and where appropriate we have made adjustments. Risks are broadly unchanged, the additional investments required to realise our integration and plan targets are included in the plan financial projections. We have reassessed the group’s scenarios to reflect the progress made in delivering our strategy. All ten principal risks were used in our modelling. They were chosen because they combine to represent plausible scenarios covering a range of different operational and financial impacts on the business.In total, three severe but plausible individual scenarios have been modelled, with a fourth reverse stress test scenario. These scenarios and the assumptions within are detailed in the table below. Theoretically all these scenarios, with differing causes could occur together, with varying levels of impact. However, we have not included a combined scenario of scenarios A to C.None of the separate scenarios modelled was found to impact the long-term viability of the Group over the assessment period. In assessing each of the scenarios, we have taken account of the mitigating actions available to us, including, but not limited to reducing discretionary operating spend, reducing non-committed capital expenditure. repricing our products and services, freezing recruitment, reducing variable incentives and temporary suspension of dividend payments. ConclusionHaving assessed the Group’s current position, potential impacts of principal risks, managing adverse conditions in the past, potential mitigating actions and prospects of the Group, the Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation over the next three years and there are no indications that impact the Group’s longer term prospects. Consolidated statement of profit or loss Consolidated statement of comprehensive income Consolidated statement of financial position These financial statements on pages [24] to [43] were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 11 June 2025 and were signed on behalf of the Board of Directors. Nick WilesChief Executive 11 June 2025 Consolidated statement of changes in equity Consolidated statement of cash flows Note to the consolidated statement of cash flows - reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents Notes to the consolidated financial statements Basis of preparation PayPoint Plc (‘PayPoint’ or the ‘Company’) is a public limited company limited by shares and is incorporated, domiciled and registered in England in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (“UK-adopted IFRS”) and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The financial information for the year ended 31 March 2025 set out in this document does not constitute the Group’s financial statements for that financial year but is derived from those financial statements. Those financial statements have been reported on by the Group’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in due course. The report of the auditor (i) was unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to thousands (£’000). The Pound Sterling is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Adoption of standards and policiesNew and amended standards adopted by the Group The Group has adopted the following amendments to standards for the first time in the year ended 31 March 2025: The accounting policies adopted by the Group in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 are otherwise consistent with those applied to all other years set out in these group financial statements. New and revised IFRS in issue but not yet effective No new standards or interpretations have been adopted in the Group’s accounting policies in the year ended 31 March 2025. At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the new and revised standards issued but not yet effective are set out below: It is anticipated that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future years will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, with the exception of IFRS18. IFRS18 will replace IAS1 Presentation of financial statements and will have an impact on the presentation of the Group’s Consolidated statement of profit or loss, with new statutory profit or loss sub-totals and income and expenditure classified into Operating, Investing and Financing categories. Going concernThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt-to-equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group. At 31 March 2025, the Group had corporate cash of £4.9 million. The Group carried out a refinancing, completed on 6 June 2024, following which its borrowing facilities consisted of: On 11 June 2025, the Group completed an amendment to the above arrangement, to manage its working capital requirements and capital allocation. Its borrowing facilities now consist of: At 31 March 2025, £58.0 million (2024: £57.5 million) was drawn down from the £90.0 million revolving credit facility and the outstanding balance of the non-amortising term loan was £45.0 million. The Group’s statement of financial position shows net assets of £97.3 million as at 31 March 2025 (£121.2 million as at 31 March 2024), having made a profit after tax for the year of £19.3 million (2024: £35.7 million) and generated cash from operations of £74.7 million for the year then ended (2024: £65.7 million). The Group had net current liabilities of £14.0 million (2024: £4.4 million). The Directors consider the going concern period as twelve months from the date of signing of these financial statements and have reviewed detailed monthly cash flow forecasts from the Group over this period. In this ‘base case’ scenario, the cash flow forecasts show considerable liquidity headroom and debt covenants will be met throughout the period. In addition, the Directors have considered and confirm there are no significant or material events that have been identified beyond the going concern period that may cast significant doubt upon the continuing use of the going concern basis. Additionally, the Directors have carried out an assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties and applied severe but plausible scenarios, together with a reverse stress test, to test further the Group going concern assumption. These scenarios included a reduction in the volume of transactions caused by a severe economic downturn, transformation and growth plans not delivering intended benefits and material one-off impacts of regulatory, IT or credit loss events. As mitigating actions, we have assumed achievable reductions in expenditure and a reduction in the level of future dividends following the payment of the final dividend of 19.6 pence per share declared in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2025. The cash flow forecasts included an analysis and stress test for the above scenarios to ensure working capital movements within a reporting year do not trigger a covenant breach. Based on this assessment the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. Use of judgements and estimatesIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years. Critical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds held on depositThe nature of payments and banking services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and retains retailer partners’ deposits as security for those collections. Love2shop also holds, in trust, gift card voucher deposits on behalf of agents, cardholders and redeemers and prepay savers’ cash on behalf of savers. A critical judgement in this area is whether each of the above categories of funds, and restricted funds held on deposit, are recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position, and whether they are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of consolidated cash flows. This includes evaluating: (a) the existence of a binding agreement, such as a legal trust, clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds;(b) the identification of funds, ability to allocate and separability of funds;(c) the identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time, and;(d) whether the Group bears the credit risk. Where there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee) and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash (referred to as ‘Clients’ own funds’) and the related liability are not included on the consolidated statement of financial position. In all other cases, the Group has access to the interest on such monies and can, having met certain conditions, withdraw the funds. The cash and corresponding liability are therefore recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position. Corporate cash and cash equivalents consists of cash freely available to the Group for use in its daily operations and is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position from non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, which is not freely available to the Group, either because of self-regulation and segregation or due to contractual or regulatory requirements. Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents comprises: Both corporate cash and non-corporate cash are included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of cash flows.Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate), comprises gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash. However, unlike the gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash included in non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) may only be accessed after a minimum of three months. Consequently, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of financial position and the Consolidated statement of cash flows. The amounts recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2025 are as follows: Critical judgement: assessment of the Group’s Cards division cash generating units (CGUs)Management reassessed its CGUs during the prior period, prompted by the signing of a new partnership with Lloyds Banking Group’s “Cardnet” division in March 2024. This resulted in the creation of a new Cards CGU in the prior period, comprising the former Handepay CGU and Merchant Rentals CGU plus the pre-existing PayPoint cards business. Consequently, the Group now tests for impairment the aggregate goodwill of £45.2 million which arose on the acquisitions of Handepay and Merchant Rentals, by comparing the enlarged Cards CGU’s recoverable amount to its carrying value. Prior to this CGU reassessment, the Group performed separate impairment tests on the goodwill which arose on the Handepay and Merchant Rentals acquisitions (£35.6 million and £9.6 million respectively) by comparing the recoverable amounts to the carrying values for each of the Handepay and Merchant Rentals CGUs. The consolidation of the former Handepay CGU, Merchant Rentals CGU and PayPoint cards business into a single Cards CGU remains a critical judgement. Critical estimate: Valuation of acquired intangible assets on acquisition of obconnect LtdThe fair value of acquired intangible assets (customer relationships, brand and developed technology) recognised on the acquisition of obconnect Ltd amounted to £11.0 million, with a related deferred tax liability of £2.7 million. Together with other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, this resulted in goodwill of £12.2 million. The estimate of fair value measurement of acquired customer relationships is considered by management a critical estimate due to a significant risk of material adjustment in the measurement period. The fair value of customer relationships is derived from assumptions, changes to which would have a material impact on its fair value. The table below summarises the fair value of customer relationships recognised, the assumptions used in deriving the fair value and the range of fair values obtained by changing one or more of the assumptions: Given that the acquired customer relationships were not purchased in separate transactions, but rather as part of the wider obconnect Ltd business combination, the ‘market participant’ perspective is hypothetical. Therefore, in measuring the acquired customer relationships at fair value, management considered the types of potential market participants (e.g. competitors and comparable companies) to apply assumptions that were consistent with the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the intangible assets. Given that the acquired customer relationships are not traded on an active market, have no recent market transactions and are unique to obconnect, management valued them using a multi-period excess earnings (MEEM) method, which reflects market participant fair value by including forecast lifetime earnings which were specifically attributable only to the customer relationships existing at the acquisition date. The discount rate applied to the MEEM incorporates general market rates of return at the acquisition date as well as industry risks and the risks of the asset to typical market participant, based on an analysis of comparable companies. The residual £12.2 million goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from the acquisition that were not individually identified and separately recognised at the acquisition date. The buyer-specific synergies subsumed into goodwill did not exist at the market-participant level at the acquisition date because i) they result from combining PayPoint and obconnect Ltd, enabling PayPoint to cross-sell to the obconnect Ltd customer base and ii) the new customer relationships and sectors are anticipated to arise post-acquisition but these were not identifiable at the acquisition date. The workforce and operating expertise are not separately identifiable intangible assets and are also included in goodwill. Critical estimate: Valuation of the investments in Judge Logistics Ltd Convertible loan notesAs explained in note 7, the Company held a convertible loan note in Judge Logistics Ltd (“Judge”) at 31 March 2025, which it had purchased for consideration of £15 million during the current period. In accordance with IAS32 Financial Instruments the Company is required to re-measure the loan note at fair value at the end of each reporting period, using an appropriate valuation method. Management used the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (“PWERM”), valuing the instrument under each of the different outcomes it identified, and assigning a relative probability to each such outcome. Management exercised judgement in assigning the relative probabilities. It assigned the highest probability to the scenario which transpired on 17 April 2025, namely the conversion of the Company’s loan note into a 3.6% equity investment in Judge, triggered by InPost spa z.o.o.’s (“InPost’s”) acquisition of Judge. Management assigned lower probabilities to other feasible scenarios. Management also exercised judgement in estimating the fair value of a 3.6% equity investment. The amount paid by InPost to purchase convertible loan notes in Judge, prior to acquiring 95.5% of it, provided management with observable market information to assist in estimating the fair value of a 3.6% share. The re-measurement of the Company’s loan note in Judge, from £15.0 million to £2.2 million, resulted in a charge of £12.8 million in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss for the current year, reported within adjusting items (see note 7). Equity investmentIn addition to the convertible loan note, the Company purchased for £100 an equity investment in Judge in the current year. This investment represented a 0.9% share in Judge following conversion of the Company’s and InPost’s loan notes on 17 April 2025. With reference to the valuation of £2.2 million derived by the PWERM method for its loan note and the estimated relative probabilities of the possible scenarios, management re-measured the Company’s equity investment in Judge at £0.5 million, resulting in a gain of £0.5 million in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss, reported within adjusting items (see note 7). Future impactWith the conversion of the Company’s loan note into equity on 17 April 2025, the element of uncertainty relating to the relative probabilities of the scenarios existing at 31 March 2025 was removed. However, the fair value attributable to the Company’s investments in Judge remains subject to estimation. It is reasonably possible that changes to assumptions used by management to estimate the fair value of its investments could give rise to further material adjusting items in the following financial year. Alternative performance measures Non-IFRS measures or alternative performance measures are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting purposes. They have remained consistent with the prior year. These measures are included in these financial statements to provide additional useful information on performance and trends to shareholders. These measures are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures. Underlying performance measures (non-IFRS measures)Underlying performance measures allow shareholders to understand the operational performance in the year, to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess trends in financial performance. They exclude the impact of one-off, non-recurring and exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, such as brands and customer relationships. The adjusting items between the Group’s statutory and underlying performance measures are as follows: Love2shop billings (non-IFRS measure relating solely to the Love2shop segment)Billings represents the value of goods and services shipped and invoiced to customers during the year and is recorded net of VAT, rebates and discounts. Billings is an alternative performance measure, which the directors believe provides an additional measure of the level of activity other than total revenue. This is due to revenue from multi-retailer redemption products being reported on a ‘net’ basis, whilst revenue from single-retailer redemption products and other goods are reported on a ‘gross’ basis. Net revenue (non-IFRS measure)Net revenue is total revenue less commissions paid (to retailer partners and Park Christmas Savings agents) and the cost of revenue for items where the Group acts in the capacity as principal (including single-retailer vouchers and SIM cards). This reflects the benefit attributable to the Group’s performance, eliminating pass-through costs to create comparability of performance under both the agent and principal revenue models. It is a key consistent measure of the overall success of the Group’s strategy. A reconciliation from total underlying revenue to net revenue is included in note 4. Total costs (non-IFRS measure)Total costs comprise other costs of revenue, administrative expenses, finance income and finance costs. Total costs exclude adjusting items, being exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and net movement on investment fair values. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group presents EBITDA as it is widely used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate profitability of companies. This measures earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. See page 11 for a reconciliation from profit before tax to EBITDA. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Underlying EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group also presents adjusted EBITDA, which comprises EBITDA, as defined above, excluding exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments. See page 11 for a reconciliation from profit before tax to adjusted EBITDA. Underlying earnings per share (non-IFRS measure)Underlying earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit before adjusting items attributable to equity holders of the parent by the basic or diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. Underlying profit before tax (non-IFRS measure)Underlying profit before tax represents statutory profit before tax excluding adjusting items. Net corporate debt (non-IFRS measure)Net corporate debt represents corporate cash and cash equivalents less bank overdraft and amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities). The reconciliation of corporate cash and cash equivalents to net corporate debt is as follows: 2. Segmental reporting Segmental information The Group considers its Love2shop business to be separate segments from its legacy PayPoint business, since discrete financial information is prepared for Love2shop and PayPoint and they offer different products and services. Furthermore, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews separate monthly internal management reports (including financial information) for Love2shop and PayPoint to allocate resources and assess performance. The material products and services offered by each segment are as follows: PayPoint Love2shop Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment profit / (loss) before tax and adjusting items is used to measure performance because management believes that this information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate in the same industries. A business division analysis of revenue has been provided in note 3. The £310.7 million (2024: £306.4 million) total revenue and £237.8 million (2024: £222.5 million) non-current assets at 31 March 2025 are geographically located within the UK. 3. Revenue Disaggregation of revenue Service fee revenue of £21.8 million (2024: £19.7 million) and management fees, set-up fees and upfront lump sum payments of £1.1 million (2024: £1.3 million) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. Card terminal leasing revenue of £10.6 million (2024: £8.7 million) is recognised over the expected lease term using the sum of digits method for finance leases and on a straight-line basis for operating leases. Multi-retailer voucher, card and e-code service fee revenue is recognised on redemption by the customer. The remainder of revenue is recognised at the point in time when each transaction is processed. The usual timing of payment by PayPoint customers is on 14-day terms. The usual timing of Love2shop’s corporate customers is 15-day terms; its consumer customers pay on ordering. Revenue subject to variable consideration of £14.1 million (2024: £13.6 million) exists where the consideration to which the Group is entitled varies according to transaction volumes processed and rate per transaction. Management estimates the total transaction price using the expected value method at contract inception, which is reassessed at the end of each reporting year, by applying a blended rate per transaction to estimated transaction volumes. Any required adjustment is made against the transaction price in the year to which it relates. The revenue is recognised at the constrained amount to the extent that it is highly probable that the inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, with the estimates based on projected transaction volumes and historical experience. The potential range in outcomes for revenue subject to variable consideration resulting from changes in these estimates is not material. Love2shop revenue is recorded net of corporate discounts. Other revenue comprises: 4. Alternative performance measures Net revenue The reconciliation between total underlying revenue and net revenue is as follows: Total costs Total costs, excluding adjusting items, comprises: 5. Exceptional items The tax impact of the exceptional items is £5,859,000 (2024: £1,305,000). Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement categories to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group, as they do not form part of the underlying business. Claim settlementThe current year deduction against revenue relates to the Group’s settlement of a claim brought against it by Utilita, as disclosed in note 12. The claim was settled after the year-end date and has been treated as an adjusting event in accordance with IAS10 Events after the reporting period. Legal feesThe current year charge relates to the Group’s defence of two claims served on a number of its companies in connection with the issue disclosed in note 12. The Group remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim served by Global-365. Chapel St. The costs arise from the Group’s decision to vacate part of its leased Chapel Street, Liverpool premises in February 2025. Following the decision, the Group will continue to pay rent until June 2029, five years short of the original lease termination date. Consequently, the lease liability and associated right of use asset were remeasured in the current year and the reduced right of use asset fully impaired, along with other assets in the vacated space. In addition, the Group has recognised an onerous contract provision for unavoidable costs related to the vacated space. ERP system amortisationThe current year accelerated amortisation costs relate to Love2shop’s ERP system. As part of an e-commerce project initiated in the current period, certain modules of that system will be replaced by 31 March 2025, earlier than the previously expected date. Restructuring costsThe prior year restructuring costs relate to the organisational design of the Group communicated by management to all staff on 6 March 2024. Refinancing costsThe prior year refinancing costs comprise legal and professional fees incurred by the Group in respect of its borrowing facilities referred to in note 1 and the write-off of the unamortised balance of capitalised costs arising on the previous refinancing exercise. 6. Tax The income tax charge is based on the UK statutory rate of corporation tax for the year of 25% (2024: 25%). Deferred tax has been calculated using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply when the liability is settled, or the asset realised. Deferred tax has been calculated based on the rate applicable at the date timing differences are expected to reverse. The income tax charge of £7.0 million (2024: £12.5 million) on profit before tax of £26.3 million (2024: £48.2 million) represents an effective tax rate1 of 26.6% (2024: 25.9%). This is higher than the UK statutory rate of 25% due to adjustments in respect of disallowable expenses, share-based payments and prior year adjustments. The tax charge for the year is reconciled to profit before tax, as set out in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, as follows: 1Effective tax rate is the tax cost as a percentage of profit before tax. Given the Group’s effective tax rate, its annual revenue and that it has no overseas operations, the Group assesses that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Pillar Two tax regime will have no impact on it. 7. Investments Convertible loan notes The movements in the fair values of the convertible loan note investments in the prior and current years are as follows: Judge Logistics LtdThe Group’s £15 million investment in Judge Logistics Ltd was purchased in three stages (£10 million on 21 June 2024, £3 million on 31 July 2024 and £2 million on 30 September 2024). Judge Logistics Ltd is the parent company of Yodel Ltd, a customer in the Group’s e-commerce parcel business. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investment to fair value in accordance with IAS32 Financial Instruments. It elected to use the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (“PWERM”), under which the Directors identified various future scenarios for its investment and assigned a relative probability and valuation for each such scenario. They considered the most probable outcome to be that which transpired on 17 April 2025, namely the conversion of the Company’s loan note into equity, following the acquisition of Judge Logistics Limited by InPost sp z.o.o. The fair value derived from the above valuation method was £2.2 million, with the £12.8 million loss recorded within adjusting items . obconnect LtdThe Company purchased a convertible loan note of nominal amount £3.0 million on 7 July 2022 from obconnect Ltd, which provides open banking services to banks and other financial institutions. Based on the key terms of the convertible loan note and investment agreement, the investment was recognised at fair value, with any gains or losses recognised through the statement of profit or loss. The fair value as at 31 March 2024 determined using the discounted cash flow method was £3,689,000. Management therefore recognised a £689,000 gain in the statement of profit or loss in the prior year, reported within adjusting items. The loan converted into a 22.5% equity stake in obconnect Ltd’s ordinary shares on the Company’s acquisition of a majority shareholding in obconnect Ltd on 30 October 2024 (see note 8). On that date, the fair value of the convertible loan note was £6,117,000, the increase of £2,428,000 reflecting the continued trading improvements of obconnect Ltd in the seven months since 31 March 2024 and an observable market price provided by the price per share paid by the Company to acquire control of obconnect Ltd. Aperidata LtdThe Company purchased a convertible loan note in Aperidata Ltd in May 2024 for consideration of £1.0 million. Aperidata Ltd provides credit reporting and open banking services to consumers and businesses. The loan converts into an equity stake in Aperidata Ltd’s ordinary shares on 23 May 2027, such that the Company’s aggregate equity stake in Aperidata Ltd following conversion will be 42.97%, including its diluted, direct equity investment referred to below. The current year discounted cash flow valuation is based on a 5-year forecast extrapolated to perpetuity, using the following financial assumptions. The discount rate reflects management’s view of the level of risk associated with the business: The fair value derived from the above valuation method was £1.0 million. Other investmentsThe movements in the fair values of the equity investments in the prior and current years are as follows: Judge Logistics LtdDuring the year the Company acquired 17.3% of the ordinary share capital of Judge Logistics Ltd for consideration of £100, in addition to the convertible loan note in Judge Logistics Ltd referred to above. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investment to fair value in accordance with IAS32 Financial Instruments. It elected to use the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (“PWERM”), under which the Directors identified two future scenarios for its investment and assigned a relative probability and valuation for each such scenario. The fair value derived from the above valuation method was £0.5 million, with the £0.5 million gain recorded within adjusting items. obconnect LtdIn the year ended 31 March 2023 the Company acquired 2.5% of the ordinary share capital of obconnect Ltd for consideration of £251,000, in addition to the convertible loan note in obconnect Ltd referred to above. In the current year, the Company increased the fair value of this investment to £516,000, the increase of £265,000 reflecting the continued trading improvements of obconnect Ltd. This 2.5% shareholding ceased to be treated as a separate investment, following the Company’s current year acquisition of obconnect Ltd. Aperidata LtdDuring the year the Company acquired 19.9% of the ordinary share capital of Aperidata Ltd for consideration of £0.2 million, in addition to the convertible loan note in Aperidata Ltd referred to above. The current year discounted cash flow valuation of this investment is £0.2 million. 8. Acquisition of subsidiary On 30 October 2024, PayPoint acquired a further 52.8% of the share capital of obconnect Ltd for consideration of £17.2 million, comprising cash of £10.5 million plus the fair values of its convertible loan note (£6.1 million) and existing 2.5% equity investment (£0.5 million) and stamp duty of £0.1 million. The convertible loan note converted into 22.5% equity as part of the acquisition, within the total 55.3% acquired. The acquisition resulted in a net £8.9 million cash outflow (net of cash acquired) in the current year. The primary reason for the acquisition was to further leverage obconnect Ltd’s technology platform, offering its Open Banking services to both new and existing clients. In accordance with IFRS3 Business Combinations, the Group identified and recognised the following intangible assets as part of the fair value exercise. The assets are being amortised over useful lives as shown: In the period since acquisition, obconnect Ltd contributed revenue of £1.8 million and profit before tax of £0.3 million to the Group’s results. Had the acquisition taken place on the first day of the financial year, obconnect Ltd would have contributed revenue of £4.5 million and profit before tax of £0.2 million. Acquisition costs incurred in the year in relation to obconnect totalled £0.1 million, which are reported within administrative expenses in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. The following table summarises the provisional fair values of the identifiable assets purchased and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities have been recognised at their fair values at acquisition date and in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies: • The acquired customer relationships including order backlogs have been valued using the multi-period excess earnings method (“MEEM approach”) by estimating the total expected income streams from the customer relationship and deducting portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting, or contributory, assets (including workforce). The order backlog is estimated based on the expected revenue to be received, less the costs to deliver the service. The residual income streams are discounted. No tax amortisation benefit is applied. The key inputs to this method are the customer churn rate, revenue growth rate and discount rate applied to future forecasts of the businesses.• Acquired brands have been valued using the relief-from-royalty method.• Acquired software intangible assets have been valued using the depreciated replacement cost method, considering factors including economic and technological obsolescence. • Trade receivables and trade payables have been assessed at fair value on the basis of the contractual terms and economic conditions existing at the acquisition date, reflecting the best estimate at the acquisition date of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected. The following acquired assets and liabilities were valued using management’s best estimates based on information available at the acquisition date, which are therefore subject to adjustment within the measurement period if new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date is obtained and, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities at that date. Of the £12.2 million goodwill acquired during the year, no goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to workforce, synergies, growth from new customers and other assets not separately recognised. A non-controlling interest (NCI) of £4.0 million arose on the acquisition, measured as 44.7% of the £8.9 million fair value of net assets acquired. The NCI’s share of post-acquisition profit in the current year was £0.1 million, resulting in an NCI balance of £4.1 million, reported within total equity in the Consolidated statement of financial position. 9. Provisions In February 2025 the Group decided to vacate part of its Chapel St. premises in Liverpool. Consequently, in accordance with IAS37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, it has recognised a provision for unavoidable costs related to the lease agreement. In May 2025 the Group settled a claim which had been served by Utilita in 2023 (see note 12). The claim settlement is treated as an adjusting event in the year ended 31 March 2025 and consequently the Group has recognised a provision at that date for the full £14.2 million settlement amount. The current year provision utilisation relates to the group-wide review of its organisational structure which PayPoint conducted in the prior year. All related payments were made to the employees impacted by the restructuring between April and October 2024. The prior year Company balance was classified as non-current. 10. Share capital, share premium and merger reserve On 13 June 2024, the Group announced a share buy-back programme of at least £20.0 million over a 12-month period. In accordance with IFRS9, the Group recognised an initial liability for the full £20.0 million, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings. The £14.9 million cost of shares purchased under the programme to 31 March 2025 is recorded against the liability. A total of 2,031,817 shares were purchased, with a nominal value of £6,773. This resulted in a reduction in Share capital of £6,773 and the creation of a corresponding Capital redemption reserve balance. Partly offsetting the impact of the share buy-back programme,146,394 shares (of 1/3p each) were issued in the current year for share awards which vested in the year and 25,910 matching shares (of 1/3p each) were issued under the Employee Share Incentive Plan. The share premium of £1.0 million (2024: £1.0 million) represents the payment of deferred, contingent share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the i-movo acquisition. The merger reserve of £18.2 million (2024: £18.2 million) comprises £1.0 million initial share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued on the initial acquisition of i-movo and £17.2 million share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the Love2shop acquisition. 11. Notes to the statements of cash flow 12. Contingent liability Ofgem’s Statement of ObjectionsIn FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received two claims relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem’s concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. The first claim was served by Utilita Energy Limited and Utilita Services Limited (subsequently renamed Luxion Sales Limited) (“Utilita”) on 16 June 2023. The second claim was served by Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (“Global 365”) on 18 July 2023. On 14 May 2025, PayPoint and Utilita came to a settlement such that Utilita has withdrawn its claim against PayPoint. As part of this settlement, the two parties have agreed to a new 5-year contract for over-the-counter prepayment services. PayPoint is looking forward to the opportunity to build a more collaborative and mutually supportive relationship with Utilita going forward. PayPoint remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365 at trial. The claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, started on 10 June 2025. HMRC assessmentIn February 2024, HMRC raised an assessment on the Group’s tax position for the accounting period ended 31 March 2021. The Group has appealed the assessment on the grounds that it is not valid from a tax technical and administrative perspective and no provision has therefore been recognised. 13. Events after the reporting date Conversion of loan note investment in Judge Logistics LtdOn 17 April 2025 the Company’s £15.0 million convertible loan note investment in Judge Logistics Ltd converted to an 3.6% equity share. The conversion was triggered by InPost spa. z.o.o. acquiring a controlling equity share in Judge Logistics Ltd by converting its loan note investment into equity. See note 7. Share buy-backOn 12 June 2025 the Group announced that the share buy-back programme, which it began on 1 July 2024 for an initial 12-month period, would be extended until the end of March 2028. The Group plans to purchase at least £30 million of shares per annum. It will continue to review the programme based on business performance, market conditions, cash generation and the overall capital needs of the business. This is a non-adjusting event, having no impact on the current year financial statements. Settlement of legal claimOn 13 May 2025 the Group settled the legal claim with Utilita referred to in note 12. The total settlement amount was £14.2 million, recorded in the current year as an exceptional revenue deduction and a provision. See notes 5 and 9. 1 Underlying EBITDA (EBITDA before exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments) is an alternative performance measure. Refer to the Financial Review for a reconciliation to profit before tax.2 Underlying profit before tax (profit before tax excluding adjusting items) is an alternative performance measure. Refer to the Financial Review for a reconciliation to profit before tax.3 Net revenue is an alternative performance measure. Note 4 to the financial information reconciles from total underlying revenue to net revenue. Total underlying revenue of £324.9 million is stated before the £14.2 million exceptional revenue deduction explained in notes 5 and 12 to the financial information.4 Adjusting items comprises exceptional items (£14.2 million claim settlement and £6.4 million for legal costs related to claims against PayPoint, £2.0 million related to lease exit costs in Love2shop and £0.8m accelerated amortisation of intangible assets), £9.6 million net decrease in fair value of the investments held in obconnect and Yodel, and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition (£5.8 million for Love2shop and £2.9 million for PayPoint).

Title: ONDO’s TVL hit new ATH with Ripple partnership – Will prices follow?

Despite the ONDO x Ripple partnership, the two cryptocurrencies did not react instantly. Ondo Finance [ONDO] continued to lead in the Real World Asset space with its recent partnership with Ripple’s XRP Ledger to enable 24/7 access through the RLUSD stablecoin. The partnership of Ondo Finance and Ripple has seen the tokenization of the U.S. Treasuries cross stay at the XRP Ledger with 24/7 get right of entry to and redemption in RLUSD. The mixing was enabled via the BUIDL fund, a BlackRock initiative, making ONDO the hub of institutional DeFi infrastructure. But this was not merely a story game — this was operational capital investment in the quest of scalable income. ONDO sprang a new all-time high on its Total Value Locked of $1.368B. This was more than $20 million in additional growth since the previous milestone. Source: DefiLlama The market cap was equal to $2.824 billion, and the daily volume was $167.02 million. The revenue was less impressive though — annualized fees stood at $54.24 million. The platform revenue was $11.69 million as holders continued to get in revenue share. That was indicative of the growth momentum in ONDO but also indicative of the absence of direct holder returns, which may become an issue as the sector matures. Nevertheless, as the XRPL integration went live and the TVL was increasing, the strategy of ONDO proved to bring results. This was in terms of bringing real-world assets to DeFi rails. The extent to which it can maintain this rate will relate to its success in balancing institutional attractiveness with community incentives. Technically, ONDO kept increasing along the trendline, and the support as it approached the $0.867 area. The price was circling around $0.88 and indication of pressure was seen as price retested trendline. Provided this support beneath ONDO held, it may rebound back to the $0.90 area and even come a second time to challenge the swing high at around $0.98. Nevertheless, a decrease to the levels under $0.867 could result in the pullback to $0.84 or even deeper. The MACD indicated a deteriorating bullish trend, with the MACD line falling below the signal line ($0.0053) and heading into negative territory. This reversal indicated possible near term weakness unless momentum could get restored. Source: Trading View The trend structure was intact in the meantime, though a confirmed break below the rising support would turn the sentiment bearish. The traders may observe $0.867 and $1 as directional validation areas. Meanwhile, the price of XRP on the other hand saw modest gains in the last 24 hours while maintaining its stay around the $2.30 zone. This stressed that the partnership did not have direct impact on prices of the crypto in the short-term but would in the long-term.

Title: XRP Ledger Adds BlackRock-Backed Treasuries In Ripple Deal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-blackrock-backed-treasuries-ripple-deal/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T01:30:20Z
Full Content:
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) moved from theory to production-grade finance today as Ondo Finance switched on its tokenized US Treasury fund, Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG), directly on the network. The launch lets Qualified Purchasers mint or redeem OUSG around the clock by settling with Ripple’s enterprise-grade stablecoin RLUSD, effectively marrying BlackRock-custodied Treasury bills to a 24/7 public chain and its native decentralized exchange. OUSG is no boutique proof-of-concept. The fund already commands more than $670 million in total value locked and sits alongside BlackRock’s own BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX at the top of the rapidly expanding tokenized-Treasury league table. Ondo’s broader real-world-asset (RWA) platform manages roughly $1.3 billion, but this is its first deployment on a non-EVM chain—an endorsement of XRPL’s purpose-built tokenization rails. Institutional investors create or redeem OUSG in a single transaction by delivering or receiving RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin that settles natively on XRPL. Because RLUSD itself moves in finality within three to five seconds, OUSG subscriptions bypass legacy cutoff times and traditional bank wires. Ripple and Ondo have committed liquidity to market-make both legs—RLUSD ↔ USD off-chain and RLUSD ↔ OUSG on-chain—so investors can scale in or out without slipping on spreads. The entire flow remains permissioned at the edges and permissionless in the core. Qualified Purchasers authenticate through Ondo’s compliance portal (leveraging Decentralized Identifiers and verifiable credentials), receive an allow-list flag on-chain, and then interact with the built-in DEX like any other asset pair. Settlement remains atomic: OUSG units burn or mint the moment RLUSD transfers, eliminating the daylight-risk gap that plagues traditional T-plus settlement cycles. XRPL’s deterministic order book, low fees, and native token-issuance primitives spare issuers the need to bolt on smart-contract wrappers for basic custody logic. Forthcoming Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) will allow OUSG to embed cash-flow rights and compliance fences at the protocol level, while the planned lending protocol will let desks rehypothecate OUSG as repo collateral without bridging to another chain. Permissioned Domains will give asset managers namespace-level control over who trades within walled gardens—a prerequisite for regulated liquidity pools. For treasury teams juggling intraday cash buffers, tokenized bills on XRPL unlock immediate redeployment of idle dollars. A fund manager who redeems OUSG at 21:00 ET on a Friday receives RLUSD within seconds and can cycle into overnight reverse-repo, stablecoin liquidity farming, or FX settlement in Asia before traditional markets even open. Conversely, corporates that sweep surplus RLUSD into OUSG every evening now capture US Treasury yield without operational drag. Markus Infanger, SVP of RippleX, framed the launch as a watershed: “Ondo’s OUSG going live on the XRPL demonstrates that tokenized finance is no longer theoretical—it’s maturing in real markets. Institutions can now access high-quality assets like US Treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need. This represents progress in bringing trusted financial assets into a 24/7 market—enabling greater liquidity, operational efficiency, and faster access to capital.” Ripple and Boston Consulting Group’s joint report projects that tokenization will convert $19 trillion of real-world assets into programmable instruments by 2033. Treasuries have emerged as the beachhead: they are low-risk, deeply liquid, and already digitized in the Federal Reserve’s master ledger, making them ideal for the first wave of on-chain replication. Total tokenized-Treasury value has surged past $7 billion this year, more than doubling since January, and is on track to eclipse the entire stablecoin float of 2017 by year-end. OUSG’s migration to XRPL could accelerate that trend. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund—the underlying asset pool into which OUSG deposits—distributes interest daily and permits same-day stablecoin redemptions, giving on-chain holders a money-market-fund experience without bank-hour limitations. By anchoring that mechanism in XRPL’s always-on settlement layer, Ripple and Ondo have effectively created a composable Treasury bill that “plugs and plays” with any XRPL-native application. The immediate roadmap is functional rather than speculative: open a secondary RLUSD-OUSG order book on XRPL’s DEX, integrate OUSG as collateral in XRPL-based lending markets once live, and extend mint-and-burn access to additional Qualified Purchaser jurisdictions as regulators sign off on the identity stack. Longer term, Ripple plans to use RLUSD as the hub currency for other RWAs—starting with commercial paper and municipal notes—turning XRPL into a full-spectrum capital-markets substrate.

Title: NYC taxi financier fined $4M for planting ‘fake news’ to boost his company’s stock price
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/11/business/nyc-taxi-lender-fined-4m-over-fake-news-plants/
Time Published: 2025-06-11T23:45:53Z

A New York financier and his publicly traded firm that bankrolled loans to taxi drivers were ordered to pay $4 million for allegedly planting fake news articles online to boost the company’s stock price. Medallion Financial Corp. — which got hit a decade ago as ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft began to tank the value of taxi medallions — will have to pay $3 million as part of a settlement after a judgment by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the US Southern District of New York. Medallion president Andrew Murstein — who made headlines when he hired Nicki Minaj to perform at his son’s bar mitzvah in 2015 — must fork out $1 million in a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a May 29 securities filing. The SEC complaint contained “more than sufficient allegations to support the claim that Murstein and Medallion Financial misled investors by withholding information material to Medallion Bank’s fair value,” Kaplan wrote in his opinion denying the company’s motion to dismiss a case brought in December 2021 under the agency’s President Biden-appointed chair Gary Gensler, The Post previously reported on Murstein’s alleged brazen scheme to secretly pay for “fake news” stories as the rise of Uber and Lyft caused investors to sour on taxi-related stocks, leaving Medallion’s share price floundering. The top executive hired media strategists to place at least 50 stories from 2014 to 2017 on sites such as HuffPost and Crain’s New York Business, according to the SEC complaint. The taxi medallion lender also failed to disclose that the authors of the bogus blogs were being paid, and that many of the stories had been personally tweaked and edited by Murstein, the complaint said. Instead, the posts were written in a way to make it look as if they had been penned by actual investors who were bullish on Medallion stock, the SEC complaint alleged. According to the SEC complaint, he had gone “opinion-shopping” when one valuation firm refused to ignore his deteriorating medallion portfolio and accept his inflated view of the company’s actual worth of $193 million. It resulted in the value of Medallion’s banking unit jumping to $280 million at the end of 2016, from $166 million just two quarters earlier, even as the price of medallions slumped, the complaint said. California PR agent Lawrence Meyers, one of the main communications specialists hired by Murstein, must also pay a $100,000 fine, according to SEC filings. As part of the settlement deal, all defendants neither admit nor deny the allegations, the judgment said. “Our agreement with the SEC puts this nearly decade-old matter behind us and enables us to apply our full focus to continuing to grow the company,” a Medallion spokesperson told The Post on Wednesday. “It removes the distraction, cost, and uncertainty of continued litigation and is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders.” News of the settlement was first reported by American Banker on Tuesday. The brash boss and his father, Leon, raked in more than $42 million from 2002 to 2014, according to the New York Times. Aside from spending lavishly on the “WAP” singer, Medallion Financial bought up professional lacrosse and NASCAR teams, the paper reported. “One wonders if the SEC is going easy on them a bit, due to the change in administration or lack of staff,” a source close to the situation told The Post. “That should give investors pause for thought if boards and executives can get away with such behavior.” President Trump-nominated SEC Chair Paul Atkins replaced Gensler. Rebecca Fike, a partner at Vinson & Elkins and a former SEC enforcement attorney, added that it shows “a desire to wrap up actions that were initiated under the previous administration.” “I expect the Atkins SEC to favor quicker resolutions and accept much lower civil penalties, particularly where the staff cannot show a corporate benefit from the fraudulent acts,” she told The Post. The company’s stock closed Wednesday at $9.50. By law, there are only 13,587 taxi medallions in New York City, and each yellow cab must have a medallion linked to it. Prices for a prized medallion soared to as much as $1 million under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But they plunged under tougher competition from the ride-sharing apps, leaving the drivers drowning in debt and piling the pressure on Medallion’s profit margins. Medallion went public in 1996. The company had been originally set up by Murstein’s taxi-driving father, a Polish immigrant, who started trading some of the cab medallions. A driver would put up roughly a third of the purchase price when buying the permit, with Medallion financing the rest with interest over a fixed period of time. After years of protests from drivers amid the rise of digital rivals, former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a deal in November 2021 to cap medallion loans at $170,000 and interest repayments at 5%. Medallion has since tried to shift to more traditional consumer and commercial banking over the past few years. Advertisement

By Madalaine Elhabbal Washington, D.C. Newsroom, Jun 11, 2025 / 18:18 pm Allegations of sexual abuse of minors within the Catholic Church in Ireland significantly spiked this past year, a newly published report has found. The total number of allegations rose by more than 50% from 252 in 2023-2024 to 385 in 2024-2025, according to the latest report by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland. The figure represents the highest number since the organization began publishing annual reports on child sexual abuse in the Irish Church in 2009. The majority of these allegations, 73%, date to the period between 1960 and 1989, with only two cases relating to the period after 2000. Forty-seven cases had no time frame attributed to them. According to the report, which covers allegations from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, the increase in allegations took place predominantly in September 2024 immediately following the announcement of a government-sponsored investigation examining historical abuse in religious-run day and boarding schools in Ireland. “These events in September 2024 appear to have given individuals renewed strength to tell of their experiences,” National Board CEO Aidan Gordon said in a June 10 press release. According to the report, 291 of the allegations received by the National Board were categorized as sexual abuse as the primary complaint. The report records 55 additional allegations of physical abuse, four boundary violations, one count of neglect, one emotional abuse, one bullying, and 32 cases where the alleged abuse was not categorized. The report indicates that 385 allegations were made against 376 people, including 318 male religious, 39 diocesan priests, 16 female religious, and three males of unknown affiliation. Of the 39 diocesan priests accused of abuse, 20 (64%) are deceased, three are laicized, three are in prison, four are out of ministry, four are under a management plan, one remains in active ministry, and four are of unknown status. Of the remaining accused, 221 of them are deceased, five are laicized, five are in active ministry, 31 are in prison, 21 are under a management plan, 12 have left the Church, 17 are out of ministry, and 22 are of unknown status. The National Board received 287 requests for advice in relation to safeguarding children from abuse within the Church in 2024-2025. The announcement of the Irish government’s September 2024 investigation came after the government-backed scoping inquiry, published in March 2023. The inquiry was initiated in the aftermath of a 2022 radio documentary called “Blackrock Boys,” which revealed extensive abuse at the Spiritan-run Blackrock College, a boys’ boarding and day school in Dublin. The scoping inquiry revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013, including extensive accounts of sexual abuse, rape, and sexual assault. Bishop Kevin Doran of Elphin described the scoping inquiry as “a tragedy” at the time, lamenting not only the sheer number of allegations in the report but also “that so many of them had to carry their experience alone for so many years before they felt sufficiently free to tell someone else.” (Story continues below) Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church. The Dublin-based Iona Institute for Religion and Society has released a comprehensive report that highlights significant shifts in religious attitudes and practices in Ireland. The announcement comes as a report from the Irish government revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013. A recent Eucharistic procession in Derry, Ireland, highlighted an inspiring revival of Catholic faith in a city synonymous with some dark days in Ireland’s troubled history.

Title: Carbon Capture Comes Crashing Down (Again): A Comedy in Subsidies

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change If you heard a distant wailing this week, don’t worry—it was just The New York Times realizing their beloved carbon capture techno-fantasy is, once again, face-planting in the real world. In a recent Climate Forward newsletter piece titled “Carbon Capture Comes Back Down to Earth”, Times writer David Gelles practically had to mop his keyboard with tears over the news that the carbon removal market—once projected to be a trillion-dollar juggernaut—is now wheezing toward irrelevance. Not that we mind. After all, here at Watts Up With That, we never bought into the carbon panic to begin with. CO2 isn’t a pollutant—it’s plant food. But watching the climate-industrial complex flop around trying to vacuum molecules out of the sky is pure entertainment. From “The Next Big Thing” to Layoff Bingo Just a few months ago, the hype machine was at full throttle. Bill Gates was investing. Google, Amazon, and Airbus were snapping up “carbon credits” like trendy NFTs. McKinsey—ever the oracle of bad ideas—declared carbon capture a $1.2 trillion market by 2050. One venture capitalist even called it “the single greatest opportunity I’ve seen in 20 years.” You almost have to admire the brazenness of the grift. Fast-forward to now: 24 government grants worth $3.7 billion have been scrapped, Climeworks axed 22% of its staff, and permit applications have tanked. The “market” is imploding because—brace yourself—no one wants to fund something that doesn’t work. Meanwhile, Climeworks’ headline-grabbing Iceland plant managed to remove only a sliver of its projected CO2. Naturally, the execs blame “ramp-up issues.” Of course they do. It’s never the technology’s fault—it’s always “early days” or “transitional challenges.” You’d think they were launching a moon mission, not running industrial shop vacs for the atmosphere. The Laws of Physics Want a Word Let’s be crystal clear: carbon capture is a thermodynamic clown show. Pulling CO2 from ambient air—where it exists at a wispy 0.04%—is like trying to find a particular grain of sand on a beach… using tweezers… while blindfolded. It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place. And even then, you still have to compress it, transport it, inject it underground, and pray it doesn’t leak back out. This isn’t cutting-edge climate tech. It’s an energy-intensive Rube Goldberg machine designed to appease green investors, virtue-signaling corporations, and bureaucrats allergic to basic physics. Bonus: It Boosts Oil Production! Now here’s the kicker: the CO2 some of these companies do manage to capture is often used for enhanced oil recovery. That’s right—after spending billions to “fight climate change,” the carbon is injected into wells to squeeze out even more oil. And yes, Occidental Petroleum—the same company running a giant DAC project in Texas—openly touts this as a feature, not a bug. The Times, ever reverent, quotes CEO Vicki Hollub promising that the project will help achieve “energy security” and “produce vital resources and fuels.” Translation: we’re going to burn more hydrocarbons and call it green. The NYT’s Tiny Violin Section What really makes this article sing is the melodramatic tone. The author laments layoffs, canceled subsidies, and a “retrenchment” in the industry like it’s some noble cause under siege. And when the DOE finally did something rational—canceling $3.7 billion in vaporware grants—the Carbon Capture Coalition, which is about as unbiased as a pharma lobby, called it a “major step backward.” For whom? Rent-seeking climatepreneurs? Even Climeworks now admits they’re going into “consolidation mode” and focusing on “efficiency.” Translation: the gravy train is slowing, so it’s time to pretend we’re tightening belts while keeping the PR spigot open. Final Thoughts: Not Our Problem Let’s be honest: the entire carbon capture craze was never about saving the planet. It was about: The NYT can whimper all it wants about Trump pulling the plug, but the real villain here is reality. Physics doesn’t care about good intentions, ESG scores, or narrative arcs. It just keeps tallying the kilowatt-hours. So while The Times continues wringing its hands over CO2 removal dreams deferred, we’ll be here pointing, laughing, and perhaps warming ourselves with the comforting glow of all that wasted taxpayer cash being vaporized in yet another doomed climate gimmick.

What do you think the O2 part of CO2 stands for? Be more curious, George Plant Trees and market them as Natural Carbon Capture Machines Please stop buying into their imaginary CO2 problem. There are lots of reasons why planting trees is a good idea, but capturing CO2 isn’t one of them. But it works. And gives us oxygen in return The oxygen is the important factor. Shade is nice. I like trees. Canada’s disgraced / dumped ex prime minister Justine Trudeau promised to plant 2 billion trees to save the planet. Turned out that all the spare land in Canada was already covered in trees, so nowhere left to plant another 2 billion of the buggers. That darn reality / rationality just keeps smacking ideology down. (Just as it always has) Somebody pointed out that some study said the permafrost line was moving northward 75 km per year causing CO2 and methane release…probable Climageddon. Someone else pointed out that they knew where the permafrost line was because the boreal forest was advancing northwards in unfrozen ground…someone else calculated how many trees must have sprouted to cover the area…Someone else calculated that Canada’s 300 billion trees only had to grow by 1.2 Kg of cellulose and lignin per year per tree to completely offset Canada’s entire anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Pretty soon the room went silent, and they changed the topic to how they could further greenwash getting more carbon taxes out of the oil and gas industry in Western Canada and rewarding their voter base in Ontario and Quebec for using electric heat pumps, and subsidizing electric cars. “Oh what a tangled web we weave When first we practice to deceive” Sounds like some of our democrats have migrated up north. We have plenty of our own greenie weenies, thank you. Our new PM (Carney) is going to sell “decarbonized oil” to Asia. Forests are carbon (dioxide) neutral of course (trees die/burn/rot) It is really hard to come up with a worse idea than downgrading perfectly good electricity into hydrogen through electrolysis, but DAC and CCS (as “climate” mitigation) take the prize. This article is far too kind to CCUS schemes and purposes. There is NO good feature, period. Engineered and built a few AGI systems (acid gas injection) …if you are producing sour natural gas, containing H2S and CO2, sequestering it underground is very good solution in most cases compared to the expense of building and operating a sulfur plant. The earth is geologically active. How do you prevent leaks? Long term. Despite the hype, there is no real evidence that CO2 has any meaursable effect on our global climate system. The AGW hypothesis has been falsified by science. Spending money trying to fight climate change is just a big waste of funds. Climeworks Very close to Slimeworks, home of the famous Slimeburger, the ubiquitous ever miltipling fast food chain in the Craig Shaw Gardner’s Neatherhell novels. I think they knew all along. Every time I see the name, I think Crimeworks. Ha! In the enviro case Crimeworks does. It lines there pockets I just saw an article that exposed the Obama EPA’s refusal to introduce their study on carbon capture and storage because it concluded that process was not a viable technology. The policies implemented required a proven process to mitigate the “pollution” they controlled. This could be a story tip if I could find the article. Dilbert Dude, Scott Adams loves the idea of carbon capture. He’s proud of his economics training. What a tard. Nobody’s perfect. Doesn’t sound like him, either. Story tip. Consider my comments on carbon capture from a Wall Street Journal article below: Subject: Occidental Petroleum’s CO2 Reduction Plan In the April 11, 2023 edition of the Wall Street Journal, an article by Benoit Morenne described a plan by Occidental Petroleum to extract massive amounts of CO2 out of the air. Occidental is spending more than $1 billion to build the first of a planned fleet of plants. The plant will remove 500,000 metric tons of CO2 from the air per year. Occidental intends to build up to 135 more of these plants by the year 2035. Occidental claims that its initial cost to remove a metric tonne of CO2 would be between $400 and $500. Using $400 a metric ton, the total cost by 2035 would be $2,400,000,000, excluding possible cost reductions due to efficiencies of scale, for removing 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2. Tax incentives will subsidize 45% of the initial costs, thanks to Bidens’ climate package that was signed into law last year. Consider how this plan will cut global CO2 levels from now to the year 2035. Assume that all 135 plants are on line and operating today. By 2035, these plants will have removed 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2. The atmosphere weighs 5,500,000,000,000,000 (5.5 quadrillion) metric tons. 810,000,000 metric tons of removed CO2 is 0.0000147% of the atmosphere. CO2 currently constitutes about 0.04 % of the atmosphere. Removing 0.0000147 % of CO2 would reduce atmospheric CO2 levels to 0.03999%, which when rounded to two decimal places yields 0.04%. Ergo, there will be no significant percentage reduction in CO2 levels. Occidental expects to generate between $400 and $630 in revenue per metric ton, which includes a $180 per metric ton tax credit. So, even without the tax credits, Occidental expects to earn between $220 and $450 a metric ton. It should be noted that cost estimates for untested new technologies tend to escalate. Occidental’s projections of costs and potential revenues may be a bit too rosy in my opinion. Time will tell. At 2.4 billion dollars, Occidental’s project may or may not be a technical or financial success. But the anticipated removal of 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2035 from the atmosphere will not measurably change the global percentage of atmospheric CO2. I don’t know what the current price is but in 2022 the water plant I worked at paid $140.60 a ton for Liquid CO2. Unless the price has skyrocketed, $400 to $630 a metric ton doesn’t sound like a bargain. (Our supplier got the CO2 from ethanol production.) How does one generate a revenue from such a system without government funding? “Pulling CO2 from ambient air—where it exists at a wispy 0.04%—is like trying to find a particular grain of sand on a beach… using tweezers… while blindfolded. It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place.” Sounds thermodynamic. But as often, emphasis rather than quantitative. And wrong. The free energy difference between CO2 at 0.04% and 100% is RT*log(.0004)=8,3*290*log(.0004)=-18832 J/mol The heat of combustion of carbon is 393,500 J/mol. Are you talking about the heat of combustion of Carbon Dioxide molecules (CO2), or the heat of combustion of the Carbon (C) element here Nick? CO2 does not burn. It will burn with Fl2 or O3, won’t it? Yeah I get that – fire extinguishers. but why mention anything about Carbon when the subject is Carbon Dioxide? The claim was “It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place.” OK, but the whole exercise was / is an idiotic pursuit in the first place, yes? And a flagrant waste of taxpayers’ dough. Nick, I think you win the battle but not the war. It does take less energy to sequester carbon than is produced by burning fossil fuels. But it takes so much energy, e.g., as a parasitical load in a coal-burning power plant, that sequestration becomes uneconomical. That is how I understood the article. Here in West Virginia AEP did a pilot CO2 sequestration project a decade or so ago and found it just won’t work. Actually, it did work. But the Virginia utility regulators refused to put their share of the costs into the rate base (AEP serves western Virginia). They also refused to pay the for the engineering study for the new 240 MW demonstration project (the pilot was 20 MW). So AEP shut down the project and wiped all of the pilot equipment off the site. What does the free energy difference have to do with extracting the molecules from the atmosphere? It’s the “basic physics” that this WUWT article says people are allergic to, but which WUWT doesn’t seem to have any idea about. So, instead of answering a legitimate question you chose to go with insults. Nick, Your argument will not convince anyone that plucking CO2 molecules from the atmosphere is a great idea. You might better spend your time planting trees. Meanwhile, I have some to cut** and dry for next year’s firewood. Just keeping up with their growth, dying, and decay is exhausting – – growth is relentless. **when I’m not planting little ones Just responding to “Let’s be crystal clear: carbon capture is a thermodynamic clown show.” It is Gelles who can’t get the thermodynamics right. Confusion there – it wasn’t Gelles (NYT), it was the WUWT writer. Your figures seem to assume that the removal process is 100% efficient. What is the actual energy consumption involved in the process? You are correct, Nick. 18.8 kJ/mol is much less than 393,500 J/mol. Billions have been invested wasted in technologies schemes to remove carbon dioxide from the sky in recent years. But Trump’s policies have clouded the outlook ended the farce. There, I fixed it. Very nice, more good news. If CO2 is removed from the air, CO2 will bubble out of all bodies of water, especially the cold polar oceans, to replace the captured CO2 molecules. What were the OXY chemical engineers thinking? Remove CO2 from the atmosphere, all other factors being equal, the oceans and earth will emit CO2 to replace it to maintain equilibrium of the partial pressure. Shoveling against the tide. Comedy is the wrong word. Tragedy is more appropriate. Direct Air Capture vs. a Leaf: Guess Which One Works Better This a loaded question. One works and one doesn’t. To my knowledge, no one has developed technology that has captured more carbon than was released in making the facility to capture the carbon. It is the same thing with wind turbines and solar panels. They do no more than shift the location where the carbon gets burnt. They do not reduce it. HOW? How could anybody be so stupid as to think such a scheme could work? How? Stupid? Maybe. Greedy? Definitely. Correction: “carbon is injected into wells to squeeze out even more oil” No. CO2 is injected. The Iceland plant did not extract even one gram of molecular carbon. It did manage a pissant amount of CO2. MIT researchers a while back came up with a very interesting process. Similar to photosynthesis, they passed are over a chemical element and in the presence of sunlight produced methane. I lost the link. Typo: they passed CO2 over a chemical element…. All of this nonsense is no different than Solyndra. It’s an unsophisticated money laundering operation where left wing politicians use taxpayer money to fund obviously non-viable projects coincidentally run by their friends. Eventually all the taxpayer money vanishes into the pockets of the politicians and their friends. There is no accountability or oversight, just a bunch of truly terrible people getting rich off the taxpayers. How much CO2 “needs” to be captured for “carbon capture” to work? What will be done with it? How much space will all that CO2 take up? Where will it be put? Some of this may have been addressed in posts I’ve missed, but they’re questions I’ve had for a while about this approach. Leaving aside whether it’s actually needed, it seems quite impractical to do at any scale that would make a difference globally. I lived in Iceland where the pictured scrubbers are. I find this very odd. They have geothermal heat everywhere. The Blue Lagoon is a tourist attraction driven by geothermal heat. If the scrubbers aren’t next to a volcano they are useless. I was lucky enough to visit Hekla when it erupted in the early 70’s. An awesome sight. There are lots of volcanoes that spew lots of CO2 in Iceland.

Design software developer Adobe (ADBE) is slated to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday, and investors are expecting a relatively modest share movement to follow. Options pricing suggests traders anticipate Adobe stock to move about 6.6% in either direction the day after its earnings report. A move of that scale would lift shares to roughly $440, their highest level in three months, or drop them to about $386, a one-month low. Adobe shares slipped 0.8% to $412.84 on Wednesday. The stock is down about 7% since the start of the year. Adobe stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 12.6% over the past four quarters, and fell in three of those instances. A 6.6% gain or loss on Friday would represent the stock’s smallest post-earnings move since December 2023. In March, shares dropped nearly 14% the day after Adobe reported record quarterly revenue but issued an outlook that underwhelmed investors. In December, it was a similar story: a worse-than-expected forecast sent shares tumbling more than 13%. Most analysts are bullish on Adobe's long-term outlook. Of the 17 Adobe analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 10 rate the stock a “buy,” six are neutral, and one rates it a “sell.” The average price target of about $477 is more than 15% above the stock’s closing price on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley analysts earlier this week said investor concerns about Adobe's long-term competitiveness and generative AI opportunity should help Adobe "step over a low bar" when results come out Wednesday. The bank assigns the stock an "overweight" rating and an above-consensus price target of $510.

Payments platform Stripe has announced its acquisition of a crypto wallet provider shortly after closing a $1 billion deal to purchase the stablecoin firm Bridge. In a post on the social media platform X, crypto wallet company Privy says it’s been bought out by Stripe, a firm that provides payment infrastructure for businesses. “Today, we’re proud to announce that Stripe is acquiring Privy. We couldn’t be more excited. Privy will continue as an independent product – but now we’ll move faster, ship more, and serve you even better, so you can stay focused on your users.” Earlier this year, Stripe completed its purchase of stablecoin issuer Bridge, the company behind USDB, a programmable dollar-pegged crypto asset backed by a combination of cash and money market funds held by BlackRock. As stated by Zach Abrams, co-founder of Bridge, at the time, “We closed our acquisition with Stripe! Together we’re scaling digital dollars to businesses everywhere. Stablecoins aren’t the future- they’re already transforming how people move money today.” Earlier this month, Stripe reportedly was in talks with unnamed banks regarding their potential use of stablecoins. Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said that banks seem eager to work with dollar-pegged digital assets. “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/DEYASA_346 Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Ivies, Index Funds, And Incarceration: How Universities Became Financial Stakeholders In The Prison Economy

ByMichelle Mbekeani ByMichelle Mbekeani, Contributor. Nashville, Tennessee USA - May 10, 2022: Entrance sign to the private research school Vanderbilt ... More University located in the west end district The private prison industry did not emerge fully formed from a corporate boardroom. It was seeded quietly, often indirectly, by capital from university endowments. American universities, as institutional investors, have long shaped emerging markets by deploying billions through private equity, hedge funds, and index‑tracking portfolios. At the time, these decisions drew minimal public scrutiny, guided by fiduciary responsibility, and framed as financially neutral. But universities’ expanding financial footprints have exposed them, directly and indirectly, to sectors with profound social implications. Now, amid growing demand for transparency and responsible investing, students, faculty, and alumni are asking: What systems have our institutions funded, and at what cost? Seed Money and the Rise of Private Prisons The modern private prison industry traces back to the early 1980s, when governments sought alternatives amid rising incarceration rates. The model: privately operated correctional facilities financed through government contracts. In 1983, Corrections Corporation of America (now CoreCivic) was launched by former Chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Thomas W. Beasley, with formative investments that included Vanderbilt University, the Tennessee Lookout reported. I have reached out to Vanderbilt University for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Three years later, CoreCivic executed its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1986, listing 2 million shares on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol CCAX at an offering price of $9.00 per share. In December 1994, the company transitioned its listing to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began trading under the symbol CXC, signaling its maturation into a more established publicly traded entity. Today the corporation runs over 100 facilities nationwide. According to its 2024 Annual Report, the company reported $2.0 billion in revenue and $68.9 million in net income. CoreCivic continues to derive a significant portion of its revenue from federal contracts, including those with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has expanded to support mass deportation efforts of the Trump administration. Its main competitor, The GEO Group, earned $2.424 billion in revenue and reported $31.97 million in net income in 2024, as detailed in their 2024 Annual Report. ETF Exposure and Indirect Investment Although universities like Vanderbilt have since disavowed direct holdings in private prison companies, some universities may still have indirect exposure within passive index funds. This indirect retention of financial ties stems from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and passive investment vehicles managed by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. An analysis by OpenSecrets highlighted that broad real estate ETFs—like Vanguard’s VNQ and BlackRock’s IYR, include private prison Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), such as CoreCivic in their holdings. ETFs are commonly used by university endowments for low-fee diversification. Because ETFs weight their portfolios based on sector representation, not ethical considerations, private prison companies could be bundled alongside shopping malls, office parks, and senior housing properties. That means universities pursuing passive real estate ETFs can unknowingly gain financial exposure to incarceration-related businesses. While some institutions have moved to ESG-screened portfolios, much of the endowment landscape remains opaque, structured through fund-of-funds vehicles and outsourced managers. According to the 2023 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments, U.S. colleges and universities manage around $839 billion in endowment assets, with a mean immediate return of 7.7%. Procurement: University Purchases from Prison Labor University interactions with the carceral system extend beyond financial markets. Some universities procure goods from prison labor programs—furniture, garments, and institutional supplies made by incarcerated workers. According to a 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, some of the furniture at the University of Virginia was made in prisons, and so was some of the furniture at George Mason University and the University of Mary Washington. This requirement stemmed from a statewide mandate at the time, requiring all public universities in Virginia to purchase furniture from Virginia Correctional Enterprises (VCE), a state-owned entity that employs approximately 1,300 incarcerated individuals, Inside Higher Ed reported. These types of procurement mandates and restrictions tend to be governed by state-level governments and their statutory and administrative codes, as opposed to university-level administration. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Madison, Wisconsin, USA-May 4, 2023: The University of Wisconsin campus in Madison, Wisconsin, USA In some states, public universities have a history of being mandated by their state government to buy prison made furniture. According to the 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, University of Wisconsin campuses have in the past been required to purchase from Badger State Industries, Wisconsin’s prison labor enterprise. According to the ACLU, some incarcerated workers earn as little as $0.13 per hour and many earn nothing at all. The Prison Policy Initiative notes wages range from $0.33 to $1.41 per hour. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Institutional Values Follow the Money Capital is not neutral. Where it flows, systems follow. Universities are not merely academic institutions, they are powerful economic actors. Through investments and procurement, many have become stakeholders in the carceral system, often unintentionally. As debates around racial justice, incarceration, and institutional accountability gain momentum, the financial ties between higher education and the prison industry continue to encounter scrutiny. The pressing question is not whether these ties exist, it is whether universities can redesign their capital frameworks to reflect their values.

As part of the integration, all bridged USDC tokens on World Chain were automatically upgraded to the newly launched native USDC. “We’re excited to announce that native USDC and CCTP V2 are now live on World Chain,” the firm wrote in a blog about the announcement. “This upgrade enhances liquidity, security, and capital efficiency for developers and users across the World Chain ecosystem.” The expansion now puts USDC, the second largest stablecoin, on 21 different blockchains, the announcement says. Circle stock (CRCL) is currently trading above $116, up more than 10% on the day and sitting at a price nearly four times its $31 IPO price. Listed on the Nasdaq, CRCL pumped as high as $138.57 on Monday. After hitting the public market last week, the stock was initially halted multiple times on its first day of trading, jumping to more than three times its IPO price in a matter of minutes. That debut exceeded the initial performance of major publicly traded tech companies like Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb upon their respective listings. The IPO, which raised $1.1 billion for the firm and early shareholders, accelerates a trend of crypto companies going public. In May, trading platform eToro made its debut on public markets. Prior to that, Bitcoin rewards company Fold went public as well. Neither, though, saw as much success upon debut as shares of CRCL, which scored a major victory when compared to the initial listings of other crypto-focused companies, in terms of share price surge after offering. However, another prominent crypto firm may join the race soon, with New York-based exchange Gemini recently filing for its own IPO. Circle, now valued around $28.34 billion, sought to go public as early as 2022. But plans to go public via a merger with a SPAC fell through at the time.

Title: World Bank Agrees with President Trump Position of Unsustainable, Unbalanced Trade Status – Global Trade Taking Advantage of USA

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/11/2025 11:38:45 AM PDT by SoConPubbie This is actually a very surprising development. The World Bank (WB) is a heavily controlled multinational exploit of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Economic Forum assembly (WEF). This could be looked upon as the WTO/WEF taking a knee as they finally accept Godzilla Trump is not going to relent. Remember, the Build Back Better agenda was a construct from the WEF/WTO.Looking a little more deeply at the people behind the latest shift in tone and paying close attention to the wording they are using, there’s an inference the World Bank is telling Europe to stop being intransigent or they will lose U.S. military support. A very unusual shift in WB tone.In my first review opinion, as the legal arbitration system for trade complaints, the WB are trying to mitigate President Trump’s full-frontal assault on the global trade imbalance that brings the global trade wealth back to the USA.NEW YORK POST […] – Top economists at the international institution, which helps finance low and middle-income countries, acknowledged that many nations do not provide reciprocal trade access to the US.“This [situation] could not be sustained indefinitely,” the World Bank’s chief economist, Indermit Gill, said during a news briefing, the Washington Post reported.[Gill] contended that Trump’s actions were merely a response to uneven trade access between other countries and the US.Other experts at the World Bank concurred with that assessment and indicated that Europe, Japan and China should all take steps to reduce trade barriers on the US, while calling for an across-the-board rollback on tariffs on all sides.

Title: Bitcoin Poised For Rally To $1 Million, Says Michael Saylor — Here’s What Will Catalyze The Epic Ascent
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-poised-for-rally-to-1-million-says-michael-saylor-heres-what-will-catalyze-the-epic-ascent/
Time Published: 2025-06-11T18:14:43Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor, cofounder and the executive chairman of Bitcoin-powered giant Strategy, has ruled out the chances of a full-blown crypto winter returning, at least not anytime soon. Crypto winter, as widely known within the cryptosphere, is a period typically characterized by a cruel correction in Bitcoin prices. According to Saylor, BTC is not going to $0 but is headed towards the $1 million per coin coveted milestone based on a number of key factors that he believes will supercharge the price of the oldest cryptocurrency. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Michael Saylor highlighted that roughly 450 Bitcoin (BTC) are minted by miners every day. At current Bitcoin prices of $109,559 as per CoinGecko, that amount is equivalent to around $50 million. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” Saylor posited. The Bitcoin bull further noted that the increasing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is buying “the entire natural supply.” Saylor’s software intelligence-turned Bitcoin Treasury firm Strategy has amassed 582,000 BTC since it started purchasing in 2020, which is valued at around $63.59 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Notably, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin surges to $500,000 or $1 million, it may be more realistic to expect it to fall by about $200,000 a coin. According to Saylor, there are enough confirmations in the wider economy to support his all-or-nothing prediction for Bitcoin. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” the Strategy co-founder quipped. Saylor also pointed out that US President Trump’s backing of Bitcoin and his efforts to create a more friendly regulatory environment will buoy the asset’s uptrend. Meanwhile, traditional banks have started to leverage this improving regulatory scene to foray into the fast-growing market, as they prepare to provide BTC custody services. He further pointed out that demand for the scarce asset is going through the roof. For instance, BlackRock and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and nation states are buying up Bitcoin daily. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s crypto council, recently disclosed that the country is set to create its own United States-esque strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor described the growing demand for Bitcoin as a “digital gold rush,” suggesting the top crypto has “gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” It’s worth mentioning that Saylor is not the only uber-bullish pundit in the crypto market. As ZyCrypto previously reported, asset manager ARK Invest bumped its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, bolstered mainly by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as “digital gold.”

Title: Tell Me About a Recent Deal: Full Guide and Example

Join 307,012+ Monthly Readers Join 307,012+ Monthly Readers We respect your privacy. Please refer to our full privacy policy. If you're new here, please click here to get my FREE 57-page investment banking recruiting guide - plus, get weekly updates so that you can break into investment banking. Thanks for visiting! The “tell me about a recent deal” question in finance interviews is designed to test your genuine interest in the industry. Anyone can copy/paste a “story” based on one of our templates, and plenty of candidates are good at memorizing the technical questions. But it’s much harder to “fake” your way into a solid deal discussion, especially in an in-person setting. Deal discussions are popular for the same reason that assessment centers are widely used in London: They’re a quick/cheap way to assess candidates and provide more accurate results than generic interview questions. If you are changing careers, you can expect to get this question a lot because it’s a great way to assess your motivations and commitment. Are you recruiting for investment banking roles to double your compensation? Or do you have a genuine interest in working on deals? Note that this guide is for discussing deals in the news, not deals you have worked on personally. Discussing your own deals is different, so please refer to the “deal sheet” article for more on that one. I’d summarize the importance of the “tell me about a recent deal” question as follows: If you’re in the “Most Important” category, it’s worth spending a few hours preparing a solid deal discussion. If you’re in one of the other categories, spend less time on it and stay focused on your story and answers to the normal fit and technical questions. I’ll suggest these qualities for any deal you discuss: If you have Capital IQ or FactSet, you can screen transactions based on these criteria and click through to the results to find the description and documents for each deal: If you cannot access these services, you must rely on simple online searches and deal summaries from other sources. There are plenty of finance newsletters from sources/people like Axios, Litquidity, etc., so you can certainly subscribe to one of those and pick a deal listed there. But there are also plenty of lesser-known-but-still-useful sources. As a specific example, the Bocconi Students M&A Circle has write-ups and analysis of deals each year, so that could be a starting point. Another example is that many boutique banks issue market and M&A reports with recent transaction activity and even public comps for the sector. The best reports I’ve seen come from Capstone Partners, which publishes detailed “industry insights” for the most popular industries. These reports are all free and require no login or even an email sign-up. For example, if you go to Capstone’s Food & Beverage M&A report, you can find “notable M&A transactions by subsector” on page 8 of the PDF: They won’t necessarily give the multiples for these deals, but once you have a few names, you can do some quick searches to find the financials. For an M&A deal, you can search for the following information: If you go against my advice and discuss an equity or debt deal instead, you’d have to search for documents like the S-1 for an IPO or a credit rating update issued by the credit rating agencies. To say anything about the valuation, you’d have to use sites like FinViz or BeyondSPX to look up multiples for other companies in the sector (or hope the Capstone reports cover it). I recommend against discussing these deals because of the extra time and effort required. Continuing with the food & beverage industry, I’ll use Celsius’ $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu, announced in February 2025, as an example. There is no Fairness Opinion because Alani Nu was private, but there are shorter and longer investor presentations: The quality of Substack articles varies widely, but it’s always worth searching the site for commentary on specific deals: The details in these posts are not always correct, but you can sometimes use them to stand out in interviews by bringing up more interesting talking points. It’s not like reading the WSJ or FT, where the articles recycle the same points repeatedly (usually from the company’s PR department). You should read enough of the source material to outline the following points: Here’s a sample outline for this Celsius / Alani Nu deal: This is a lengthy outline (over 250 words), so it might be too long for your initial answer. A shorter, ~100-word version might be a better “first response” in this case: “One recent deal I followed was Celsius’ $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu in the energy drink and supplement space. Celsius had weak recent sales growth and did the deal to return to growth and gain more distribution, but the unadjusted multiple was 21x EBITDA, which is very high for this vertical; adjusted for synergies and tax benefits, it was more like 12x. I still think it’s quite an expensive deal in a difficult market, and it might reduce Celsius’ ability to do future deals since it also issued $900 million in Debt to fund it.” When you present your short deal outline, the discussion could go in different directions. If the banker is satisfied and wants to ask about other topics, they might switch to other questions. But if they want to dig deeper or test your knowledge, they might ask follow-up questions to see how much you know. All you can do to “prepare” for these questions is read more of the source material and sketch answers to a few common follow-ups. Common questions include: This information takes more time to find, so budget your time based on the importance of this question (not important for university students, but more important for MBA/experienced hires). Since we first covered deal discussions on this site, a flood of AI tools, chatbots, and AI-powered search engines have been released. Many of these tools claim to “do all the work for you.” So, you might look at this guide and think: “This seems like a lot of work. Can’t I just ask ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Grok to do everything? Then I can memorize the answers.” The short answer is that you can use these tools to speed up your research/prep process, but you should never rely on them 100%. There are several specific problems: The last point is so important that I recommend using pencil and paper to draft deal outlines and even responses to fit/behavioral questions. Yes, it’s 2025, and I am still recommending a stone-age method because it’s still the best way to make details “stick” for in-person interviews. I mentioned in the introduction that the “tell me about a decent deal” question is designed to test your interest and commitment to investment banking, especially for career changers. But it’s also a great example of why banks are old-school and will always conduct in-person interviews, even if the initial rounds are done via HireVue. You could cheat your way through entire interviews if they’re all remote. And even when you go in for an in-person Superday, it’s still possible to “game” standard interview questions with enough memorization. But it’s very difficult to get through an extended deal discussion if you haven’t done the work or don’t understand the metrics and rationale. So, expect this question to become even more important in the future. Just hope the shift happens before banks shift even more of their workload to bots and agents… Brian DeChesare is the Founder of Mergers & Inquisitions and Breaking Into Wall Street.

Title: Allison Transmission: Heavy-Duty Profits And Low Expectations

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Blue bus moving on the road in city in early morning I first made Allison Transmission (ALSN) a Long Idea in June 2020 and most recently reiterated my thesis in August 2024. After the company beat on the bottom-line but missed top-line 1Q25 estimates, my thesis remains intact, and the stock looks poised to outperform further. Allison Transmission runs a well-diversified business, in terms of its revenue-generating segments and customer base. Per Figure 1, in the TTM ended 1Q25, the company’s revenue came from: Further breaking down the largest segment, 30% to 40% of Allison Transmission’s North America on-highway revenue is driven by municipal spending, which the company notes reduces end-market volatility. Figure 1: Allison Transmission’s Revenue by Segment in the TTM ended 1Q25 ALSN Business Segments Allison Transmission holds majority market share in its core addressable market (which includes class 4 through 8 vehicles) within its North America on-highway segment. For example, as of 2024, the company holds a market share of: The North American production in Allison Transmission’s core addressable market is projected to grow 1% compounded annually through 2030. See Figure 2. With its strong expertise, product development, service network, trusted brand name, and leading market share, Allison Transmission is poised to grow alongside the broader industry. Figure 2: North American Production in Allison’s Core Addressable Market: 2014 – 2030E ALSN Projected NA Growth In its 1Q25 presentation, Allison Transmission’s management highlighted four different opportunities that it expected will each generate an additional $100 million incremental annual revenue. These opportunities are in four separate end markets and include: As noted, these opportunities combine to create a potential total $400 million in incremental annual revenue. Allison Transmission is in a great spot to capitalize on the transition to electric vehicles and parts. As noted in my previous report, the company has already demonstrated the viability and success of its electric product offerings, with significant growth opportunities still ahead. While Allison Transmission offers multiple electric/hybrid products, its electric hybrid propulsion system for buses stands out the most. To date, the company has delivered nearly 9,800 of these systems for buses worldwide, which has resulted in an estimated savings of 457 million gallons of fuel and 3.9 billion miles of reliable operation. Since its introduction in 2003, this product line has generated over $1.5 billion in revenue. Additionally, the global electric bus market is projected to grow 14% compounded annually, from 2024 to 2030. Figure 3: Global Electric Bus Market Forecast: 2024 – 2030 ALSN Electric Bus Market Forecast The company also continues to produce zero-emission electric axles for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, which provide a “content per vehicle” opportunity that is three times higher compared to a fully automatic transmission. Allison Transmission’s newest electric product offering is an electric hybrid propulsion system for tracked combat vehicles. The transmission will allow electric hybrid propulsion and electric-only silent maneuverability. Allison will provide American Rheinmetall the next-gen electrified transmission for its Lynx vehicle, which is competing for the U.S. Army’s XM30 combat vehicle program. This program is a ground modernization initiative that could replace nearly 4,000 infantry fighting vehicles. Allison Transmission has a long track record of quality fundamentals. The company has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 4% and 9% compounded annually since 2014. The company’s profit growth has been particularly strong since the COVID induced lows of 2020. See Figure 4. The company improved its NOPAT margin from 15% in 2014 to 25% in the TTM while invested capital turns rose from 0.5 to 0.8 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 8% in 2014 to 19% in the TTM. Additionally, the company’s Core Earnings, a superior and cleaner earnings measure, grew 12% compounded annually from $240 million in 2014 to $745 million in the TTM. Figure 4: Allison Transmission’s Revenue and NOPAT: 2014 – TTM ALSN Revenue & NOPAT 2014-TTM Since 2019, Allison Transmission has paid $506 million (6% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.15/share in 1Q19 to $0.27/share in 1Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.0% yield. Allison Transmission also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. During the first three months of 2025, the company repurchased $150 million worth of shares. In 2024, Allison Transmission repurchased $254 million in shares. The company has $1.4 billion authorized repurchases remaining under its current authorization. Should the company repurchase shares at the 1Q25 pace for the rest of the year, it would buy back $600 million of shares in 2025 and provide a 6.9% repurchase yield. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 7.9%. Even if the company only repurchases shares at its 2024 pace, it would repurchase an additional $104 million of shares in 2025, which would represent 1.2% of the company’s current market cap. Allison Transmission has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) every year since 2013 (earliest data available). Investors should take comfort in knowing Allison Transmission will be able to afford to pay its dividends and repurchase shares due to its large FCF generation. From 2019 through 1Q25, Allison Transmission generated $3.4 billion in FCF, which equals 31% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 5: Allison Transmission’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2019 – 1Q25 ALSN Free Cash Flow 2019-1Q25 Allison Transmission’s $3.4 billion FCF since 2019 is more than enough to cover its $2.6 billion in combined dividend payments ($506 million) and share repurchases ($2.1 billion). Unlike many other riskier stocks, Allison Transmission’s repurchases have also meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 118 million in 2019 to 84 million in 1Q25. See Figure 6. In its 1Q25 investor presentation, the company pointed out it has repurchased nearly 64% of shares outstanding since its IPO. I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of spending it on costly acquisitions or executive bonuses that rarely drive shareholder value creation. Figure 6: Allison Transmission’s Shares Outstanding: 2019 – 1Q25 ALSN Shares Outstanding 2019 - 1Q25 Allison Transmission is not only the leading manufacturer of fully automatic transmissions for the on-highway, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle market in North America, it also has the highest profit margins in the industry. Over the TTM, Allison Transmission has the highest NOPAT margin and third-highest ROIC among competitors, which include Caterpillar (CAT), Dana (DAN), Cummins (CMI), and more. See Figure 7. Figure 7: Allison Transmission’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM ALSN Profitability vs Peers While Allison Transmission’s markets are projected to grow over the long term, the cyclical nature of each industry cannot be avoided. Allison Transmission notes specifically in its 1Q25 earnings presentation that its mining and construction market has “considerable end market cyclicality” even as the company believes there will be less cyclicality in its energy segment. I show the cyclicality in production in its largest segment, North America, in Figure 2. After four straight years of production growth, production is expected to decline YoY in 2025, then fluctuate significantly through in 2026 – 2027, before rising once again through 2030. By diversifying its end markets, Allison Transmission can minimize cyclicality on the overall business. When one segment is in a trough, another can be peaking, thereby allowing the company to generate positive cash flow throughout all economic cycles. The good news for investors, despite a consistent track record of profitability and long-term growth drivers, Allison Transmission’s stock is priced as if the company’s profits will never grow again, as I’ll show below. At its current price of $105/share, ALSN has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s profits to never grow from TTM levels. For context, Allison Transmission has grown NOPAT by 4% compounded annually over the last five years and 9% compounded annually over the last ten years. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for ALSN. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: then the stock would be worth $105/share today – or equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Allison Transmission’s NOPAT would grow <1% through 2034, which is far below historical growth rates. If I instead assume Allison Transmission’s: ALSN would be worth at least $129/share today – a 23% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Allison Transmission’s NOPAT would grow just 2% compounded annually through 2034. Should ALSN grow profits more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. Figure 8 compares ALSN’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios.

Title: What’s Driving AMZN Stock Higher?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Brick facade of Amazon office building with logo, San Francisco, California, May 27, 2025. (Photo by ... More Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Over the last year, Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has appreciated 16%, closely mirroring the NASDAQ’s 14% increase. This year has been rather tumultuous for Amazon stock. After reaching peaks above $240 in January, the stock decreased by over 30% to just below $170 by April. This drop was mainly influenced by President Trump’s vigorous trade policies. Yet, as trade tensions subdued, the stock rebounded 30% from its lowest point. When examining a slightly extended timeframe, AMZN stock has surged 43% since the start of 2024. This notable growth can largely be credited to three major factors: We’ll explore these factors in greater detail. Our dashboard on Why Amazon Stock Moved contains more information. While AMZN stock has seen impressive gains, if you desire growth with a less volatile experience than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since inception. Additionally, check out – QBTS Stock: What’s Next For D-Wave After 1,350% Rally? Amazon’s revenue growth of 13% since 2023 arises from robust long-term trends in e-commerce, streaming, and digital advertising. While sales in North America climbed by 10% and international sales rose by 9% last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) served as the main growth driver, soaring by 19%. This underscores the effectiveness of Amazon’s strategic diversification, with AWS emerging as an exceptionally valuable segment. Looking forward, AWS will remain vital for Amazon’s expansion, although the company faces growing competition in cloud computing from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Microsoft’s strong collaboration with OpenAI and substantial investments in AI, combined with Google’s rapid growth in generative AI cloud services, present significant obstacles. To preserve its market leadership in this dynamic tech environment, Amazon must continue to innovate. Like its rivals, Amazon is allocating tens of billions to AI-related capital projects. AWS has significantly enhanced Amazon’s financial outcomes, primarily by increasing its overall profitability. Since 2023, Amazon’s operating margin has expanded dramatically by 72%, increasing from 6.4% to 11.0%. This improved profitability, alongside strong sales growth and AWS’s strategic development, has favorably altered investor perception. As a result, the company’s price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 30%, from 2.8x trailing revenues in 2023 to the current 3.6x. At its current trading price of $217, Amazon’s stock is priced at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.6x, which is closely aligned with its five-year average of 3.2x. Nevertheless, there are strong reasons to anticipate that the valuation multiple could increase further. Amazon’s strategic investments in AI are expected to drive significant expansion across its various business segments. Within AWS, heightened demand from businesses developing and utilizing AI applications is projected to directly benefit cloud infrastructure sales. Concurrently, AI is set to improve Amazon’s retail functions through enhanced product recommendations, search, and personalized shopping experiences. These developments could result in higher conversion rates, increased average order values, and more effective ad targeting both on its platform and within the broader digital advertising ecosystem. As a result, Amazon anticipates low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with even more notable increases in bottom-line growth expected. This enhanced profitability, in conjunction with ongoing AWS expansion and Amazon’s continued dominance in the e-commerce sector, supports a strong case for a higher valuation multiple. Investors are likely to view these strategic AI initiatives as essential catalysts for future growth and value generation. Amazon stock is not without its risks. During the inflation-driven market downturn in 2022, AMZN fell 52%, dropping from a January peak of $170.40 to $81.82 by December. This decline far exceeded the S&P 500’s 25.4% drop. AMZN did not return to its previous high until February 2024, highlighting both its volatility and resilience. Earlier this year, a similar pattern was observed amid trade war anxieties, where the stock dropped 30%, compared to a 19% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500. In addition to broader market and geopolitical challenges, there are company-specific risks associated with Amazon’s substantial capital expenditures. Since 2023, Amazon has poured an astounding $161 billion into CapEx. A critical question remains: what if these considerable investments fail to deliver the anticipated returns? Indeed, financial risk is just a minor facet of the risk assessment framework we utilize while creating the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. This portfolio encompasses 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. What accounts for this? As a whole, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While AMZN stock appears poised for further appreciation, it is valuable to assess how Amazon’s Peers perform on key metrics.

Title: They made Balatro for stock trading and I fear I may never write another article ever again

All my cards. Gone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There's something alluring about high finance, isn't there? Mostly, I suppose, it's the promise of generating absolutely enormous amounts of money for very little actual work, but it's undeniable that the industry—such as it is—has gone out of its way to cloak itself in a certain mystique. The suits, the jargon, the barking into telephones in smoke-filled rooms: what is ultimately just a building full of boys who did boring degrees and have too much money sure does manage to make itself appealing and mysterious, like they were a cabal of sorcerers or something. All this is to explain why I continue to find myself suckered into any and every game that lets me pretend to be one of these masters of the universe, like the excellent Stonks-9800 and, now, the Steam Next Fest demo for Insider Trading. Much like its namesake, Insider Trading is fun, profitable, and victimless, and I strongly recommend you give it a try. Because it's Balatro. Someone went and made Balatro but stock trading and, friends, I fear for my ability to get anything done ever again. This is a roguelike deckbuilder (as are most games in 2025) with a wobbly, warbly, CRT-style interface that sees you assemble absurd multipliers out of painstakingly composed hands of cards, all while using a meta-currency to amass perks that change the flow of the game, cut away at or add cards to your deck, and to optimise your hand. It's not poker-themed, though. Where Balatro had you assemble real-life poker hands to generate your score, Insider Trading just pulls 10 cards from your deck and triggers them in whatever order you leave them in your hand. The goal is to amass enough money (points) to hit a certain target by the end of a week: $1,200 by Friday, $2,000 by next Friday, that kind of thing. At the start of a turn you can either skip—if you think things will go badly—or trade, at which point you'll buy the maximum number of stocks you can with whatever cash you have and wait for your assembled hand to affect the stock price. Assuming you did your maths right, you'll sell off those stocks for more money than you started with. Though, hopefully you won't increase the stock price to something higher than you can afford. It starts off simple enough. You might pull six cards that increase the stock price by anywhere from 1% to 5% each, and another four that decrease it by the same amount, but things quickly get weirder. For instance: This card will add or subtract 10% to the price only if it's played first, this card will delete other cards of a certain suit if you place it adjacent to them, this card will buff other suits by 1.5x each time it's triggered. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I made full use of that last one. Every time I amassed enough tokens to buy a new perk, I stacked on another 'trigger your first card three times' and let it ride, amassing enough of them to trigger my first card 12x every turn and almost obviating the entire rest of my hand. It worked out pretty well, right up until I triggered an event based around shorting, where suddenly it became necessary to decrease the price rather than increase it to make money. It rather made me and my deck composed entirely around buffing the price up a little bit redundant, and I quickly found myself reduced to penury as my fortune. Sound good? Of course it does. So I definitely recommend checking out Insider Trading's demo while you have a chance. Also, you'll always have a chance, because although its demo is featured in Steam Next Fest, it's not a Next Fest-exclusive demo.

Quantum computing shares are jumping in premarket trading Wednesday after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that the industry is “reaching an inflection point." Huang's comments during his keynote speech at the chipmaker’s GTC Paris developer conference mark more optimistic take by the Nvidia CEO, who said early this year that quantum computing technology is 15 to 30 years away. “Quantum computing is reaching an inflection point,” Huang said in the speech Wednesday. “We are within reach of being able to apply quantum computing, quantum classical computing, in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years.” Quantum computing involves qubits, which can exist in a multidimensional state, unlike a normal computer bit that can be in one state (either 0 or 1), making them capable of much more powerful computations than ordinary computers. Shares in Quantum Computing (QUBT) are jumping more than 14% in premarket trading, Rigetti (RGTI) shares are up 7%, and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) shares are rising 4%. Shares in quantum computing firm IonQ (IONQ), which announced the acquisition of a U.K. rival Monday and has a collaboration with Nvidia, are up 5%. IBM (IBM) shares, which hit an all-time high Tuesday after it showcased a "viable path" to building the world’s first large-scale, "fault-tolerant" quantum computer by the end of the decade, are little changed in premarket trading.

AI.gov site was discovered by researchers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. An apparently leaked GitHub page has revealed the Trump administration is working on a website called ai.gov, set to launch on July 4 with the aim of trying to, “accelerate government innovation with AI” The site was uncovered by 404Media researchers after an early version of the website was posted on GitHub by the General Services Administration (GSA), The Register reports. Now taken down, the page was aimed at serving as a hub for government agencies to enable AI integration into their processes. The GSA department responsible for the website looks to be the Technology Transformation Service (TTS). Headed up by Thomas Shedd, a close associate of Elon Musk, the TTS will seemingly launch the AI website with three key components; a chatbot, an “all-in-one” API that enables connections between existing systems and AI models from Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI, and ‘CONSOLE’ - a "groundbreaking tool to analyze agency-wide implementation," according to the page. The initial staging site suggests that the ai.gov site will serve AI models through Amazon Bedrock, and most of the models listed in the API documentation on the GitHub page are FedRAMP certified for government usage, the researchers confirmed. However, they note that one model identified and listed from AI firm Cohere is not FedRamp certified. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The fact the US government is planning to leverage AI or increase its connections with AI companies probably won’t come as much of a surprise to anyone - with the Trump administration pushing hard for widespread government adoption. Earlier in 2025 it was announced that the IRS could use AI to replace fired workers following mass layoffs at the hands of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Other departments like the SEC and VA are reportedly bracing for ‘restructuring’ as the department investigated whether AI can be used to replace human workers across a range of government departments.

I’m HBR executive editor Alison Beard filling in for Hannah Bates. This month, we’re highlighting some of the best conversations from the 2025 HBR Leadership Summit held in April. In today’s episode, we hear from David Risher, the CEO of Lyft. Since taking the wheel in 2023, figuratively and literally, Risher has led the company through a bold transformation—focusing on customer obsession, technological innovation, and a renewed commitment to drivers and riders alike. Lyft recently reached record bookings and a 31% increase in annual revenue and its first full year of profitability. In this conversation with me, Risher shares how his own experience behind the wheel as a Lyft driver informs product innovation. And why listening deeply—whether to a single passenger or a room of drivers—can lead to breakthrough ideas. He also opens up about navigating layoffs, launching inclusive features, and preparing for an autonomous future while keeping human dignity front and center. If you care about service, leadership, or what it takes to revive a brand in a hyper-competitive space, this episode is for you. Here it is. ALISON BEARD: I want to hear how Lyft evaluates and anticipates what customers want and need. Is it analytic surveys, focus groups, all of the above? DAVID RISHER: It’s kind of all of the above, but in maybe a different order. So I would actually say analytics are the least important, and I’m going to tell you why in a second. The most important, for sure, is lived experience. So we’re really lucky. Lyft gives two million rides a day, obviously a huge volume, 800 million rides a year. And every one of us– we have 3,000 people who work for us. Every one of us can be a rider or a driver. And I actually am a huge, huge believer in lived experiences, one of the best ways to– because then you’re literally putting yourself in the driver’s seat or in the passenger seat. You don’t even have to imagine it. We also do round tables pretty often with drivers in particular where we’ll bring groups of drivers together. I’ve done them in New York. I’ve done them in DC, in Boston, in Seattle, here in San Francisco because people’s interests vary a little bit in different parts of the country, so for sure. Social media is also really important. Of course, you have to filter things out a little bit, but there is a lot of wisdom out there if you can see through the noise and through some of the frustration and extreme stuff that you get. I get email every day and texts all the time from friends and from random people who find my email address online. And so it’s all that. And then analytics is– the reason I say it’s the least important is because it’s so tempting, I think, to sit at your desk and look at the numbers. And while you can use that to size opportunities and maybe prioritize, but you very rarely get the real insight that leads to the breakthrough just by looking at the analytics. ALISON BEARD: I know that you’ve done some Lyft-driving yourself, so is that standard process for all managers so you can better understand the situation on the ground? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, I’d like to say that it is. This sounds maybe a little braggy, but I think I’ve driven more than– I think this is true– than just about anyone else at the company. So we have 1.5 million drivers on the platform. They’re all independent contractors. But in terms of Lyft employees, I might be the first. I’m not sure. I drive about every six weeks, and I never tell people when I’m going to do it. I don’t tell the social media team or anything like that. I do post about it afterwards just with the pictures and experiences I’ve had, and you can see that on LinkedIn. But I take it really seriously, really seriously. And I listen very carefully. I ask, tell me why you chose Lyft today, and also very interested in other things going on in people’s lives. I’ve had these great conversations with people who, for example– I’ll give you an example. So I picked a woman– I live in San Francisco. I picked a woman up– this was last year– in Sausalito. And I said, why did you choose Lyft? And she said, well, look, every day I wake up in the morning at, like, 6 or 7 o’clock in the morning. And I said, why? And she said, well, to check the pricing because sometimes it’s $20. Sometimes it’s $30. Sometimes it’s $40. And it kind of drives me crazy because when it’s $40, that’s too expensive for me, but when it’s $20, I’ll take it. $30, maybe I’ll check the competition. But today is a colleague’s birthday, and so I really wanted to be there. So I was so glad that it was inexpensive. So just that conversation really got me understanding how frustrating what’s called surge pricing is to people. And I can tell you all about this, but we have a feature called Price Lock that really tries to get rid of it. And it was really developed or it was catalyzed because of that conversation I had with her. ALISON BEARD: So when you get these new ideas for features or services, how do you make a decision about which will be worthwhile and value-creating to pursue? And then how quickly can you move to execution? DAVID RISHER: So two very different questions. The answer to the second is it’s never quickly enough, so this is a source of constant– it turns out, as a CEO, you can have all sorts of ideas about how fast things can go, and then just brutal reality gets in your way. I’ll come back to that in a second. The prioritization is– so we have a pretty rigorous process because, again, of course, there are always more ideas than you can possibly do. And so broadly, broadly speaking, we’re always– OK, Lyft’s business model, very simply, is the more people we have taking rides, the better we do. It’s kind of that simple. If our fixed costs are more or less fixed, which they are, then the incremental contribution of every ride– it might be $1, or it might be $2, might be $3, whatever it is– is a certain number. And the more of those we can drive across the platform, the more money we make. We’re now profitable, as you said in your introduction. We spun off about $760 million in cash over the last 12 months. That was up from negative $300 million the year before. So once you really understand the basics of the business model, everything else is just execution. And so that helps you understand then how you evaluate new ideas is, can it– is the product market fit– is the potential for product market fit so good that it could potentially drive hundreds of thousands or millions of more rides on the platform? Now, the economics of them might be different. So for example, with Price Lock, it’s actually a subscription product. You pay $2.99 a month, and then you lock in a price, a cheap price so it doesn’t bounce around. And then we have to do a lot of math to try to figure out whether we can make money on that or not. So you then have to figure out whether you can do it profitably. But the first question is, is it compelling? Is it interesting? Can it touch either, I’ll say– let’s call it millions of people. Or is it something that maybe a smaller group of people care about, but they care about it so much that the impact is outsized? And I think those are two different cases, but they both come up. And I’ll give you just very quickly an example of the latter. This actually came out of another– I mentioned this idea of driver roundtables. We were talking to about 12 different people. This is in New York City. And we were talking about things that they like about the platform and things they don’t, and one of the women said almost offhand– she said, you know, I have a tough time taking breaks to go to the bathroom. And I said, why? And she said, well, some bathrooms– they feel unsafe, or they’re dirty, or whatever. And then she said, the thing that struck with me– that stuck with me the most. She said, and I can’t just pull out a bottle and pee in it. It’s like, OK, that’s a good point. And so we developed as a result of that and some other things we’re doing something called a restroom finder now that allows drivers to indicate where there are safe restrooms and easy-to-access restrooms and maybe what the restroom code is. So anyway, so it might only affect a– it affects all drivers at some point, but it probably only affects a small number of drivers in a deep way. But for those drivers, it’s really important. ALISON BEARD: I love that example because it illustrates how you have customers that are riders, but then your drivers are also your customers. So you have to be equally obsessed with their experience. DAVID RISHER: That’s right. ALISON BEARD: So talk about that execution piece. And sorry for jamming two questions together, but when you decide that that’s a great thing to implement, the restroom finder, how do you ensure that your teams can get it out there quickly enough that it makes an impact? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so it’s such a– it’s a simple question, and there are multitudes within it because of course you have an annual plan that you’ve done. You have certain themes you really want to work through over the course of the year. So as an example, one of the themes we’ve been working on for quite a long time is, how can we increase driver earnings? How can we increase driver earnings? As you say, there are two customers in every car. The rider has a certain price that they’re willing to pay. The driver has a certain price that they’re willing to accept. And we have to figure out how to make those lines cross millions of times every single day. Drivers get very frustrated if they feel that they’re not getting rides that meet a certain threshold for them. In some cases, there’s work we can do at the user interface level to help a driver see how much they’re going to make. This is something we’ve done a lot of work on to make it very clear every time they accept a ride how much money they can expect to make on that on a per-hour basis so it’s easy for them to compare. But we’ve also put in minimum standards. So we used to have no minimum. Now we have a 70% earnings guarantee. That means that at the end of every week a rider will always get– excuse me, a driver will always get at least 70% of what riders pay after insurance and some other fees are taken out. And that’s been a game-changer, very expensive– it costs us millions of dollars to do– very technically complex. And so it took us months and months of work to do. This was last year. But because it fit in a thematic piece that we’d already put out for ourselves over the year, how can we increase driver earnings, we had space for it. So it was a lot of work, but it was kind of straightforward. The trickier ones are ideas that come along the way that you hadn’t necessarily anticipated, or you realize, we’re kind of missing the boat here, or whatever it is. And then, frankly, it’s a lot of my job as CEO– you think of it as an allocation question. Like, how do I reallocate resources periodically in a way that focuses on a combination of what we thought was important at the beginning of the year and what we think is important now without being so disruptive? I know that’s of a generic answer, but it’s the way it goes. ALISON BEARD: No, I think that’s useful. So I’m on the same note, when you discover that there are problems, how do you fix them? I hear you have something called Falcon Mode. DAVID RISHER: I do. [CHUCKLES] I do. I do. Yeah, I do. So Falcon Mode refers to the idea that– so Falcons are unbelievable animals. And I’m not a falconer, by the way. I don’t know that much about them. But what I do know is that they can fly at very, very high altitude for a very long period of time. But then they get hungry, and so they’ve got to dive. And they got to dive 2,000 feet or whatever it is and then pick a fish out of the ocean or whatever it is they actually eat. As I say, I’m not really a falconer. So as a metaphor, I use it sometimes to help people understand, there are going to be times where even I at the level that I operate need to go deep, and I need to go deep fast. I need to understand some problem at some level of detail so that I’m assured myself that I’m making good calls on whether or not to put energy over here or energy over here or what have you. Now, the problem, of course, is that generally people who work for you don’t like this very much. [CHUCKLES] And there’s this word, “micromanagement,” that comes up from time to time. I don’t think I’m that person, but maybe some people have a different opinion. But my point is I’m not trying to solve necessarily the problem. That’s generally not my job. But I do believe that sometimes you have to go very deep to understand the problem and to hang out in that problem space for a while and really get it. So let’s go back to driver earnings for a second. It’s very easy to detect that drivers want to be paid more like anyone who’s doing a job. That’s not complicated. The question becomes then, how do you do it in an economic way? But I think what becomes more interesting is, well, hold on. What else are drivers telling us about their goals and their life besides the obvious, besides the loud thing, which is earnings? And one of the things that we know is that– so the vast majority of people who drive on the Lyft platform do it part time. They’ll do it 20 hours a week or less. Often it’s supplemental income. Sometimes it’s a bridge. They’ve just lost their job, and they need to earn quick money, whatever it is. But it’s always– most of the time– let’s call this 85% of the time– it’s part of a bigger plan. Call it 15% of the time a person might want to be a professional driver. 85% it’s a bigger plan. So how can we support them? How can we– how can we support them in a way that’s going to be economically good for us? So we put together this thing called the driver accomplishment letter, which allows the driver to push a button and get a readout of their accomplishments, an AI-generated readout so they can use that, for example, as a reference letter for another service-oriented job. That’s an example– sorry for going on at some length with this, but that’s an example of moving beyond the transactional and the obvious stuff and trying to understand deeply enough, what do drivers really care about? Not just making more money but setting themselves up for maybe longer-term financial success in a way that if you don’t do those social media readings or focus-groupy-type things– you might not get to. But once you get there, you realize, oh, yeah, this really matters too. ALISON BEARD: Yeah. So in your recent shareholder letter, you recently wrote about a different kind of problem. You have a term for it that I’ll let you share yourself. But it’s basically the slow degradation of a product, of a service that happens over such a long period of time that you’re not really aware of it, until the problem is so bad that it’s more difficult to fix. So how do you protect against that? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so I think you’re referring to enshittification. I appreciate your– [CHUCKLES] I understand. I wrote this letter myself, but of course I have other people who look at it. And I got a lot of– some pushback on the term. But I said, look, this is it’s first of all, it’s not mine. It’s Cory Doctorow’s term. You might know him. He’s an author and a thinker. And one of the things that he recognized some period of time ago is that ideas and businesses, let’s say– they start often with a high-quality, high-bar mode but then over time tend to get worse. And you can see this even within rideshare. Rideshare, for those of you who’ve been paying attention for, let’s say, the last decade– you might remember when you first got in the car it was kind of a magical experience. The driver treated you super well, and maybe it was a very nice car. And it kind of felt amazing. I push a button, and three minutes later, someone pulls up. They take me where I want to go. I don’t have to pay at the end. It seems like magic, all this stuff. Well, rideshare, like many other things– but I’ll use the industry I know the best. I would say, looking at it objectively, it’s gotten worse over time, not better. And we’re in the service industry. That’s crazy. So one of the, let’s say, responsibilities I feel, as a leader in this industry, is to push against that and to say, let’s not just let that be the way. Let’s not let quarterly earnings or what I call additive bias– again, not my term. But there’s always a general mode of, just add more and more stuff to a thing, and make it better, which sometimes is exactly the wrong thing to do. Anyway, let’s actively fight against some of this. And again– I should zoom out– my basic premise in the last two years has been– customer obsession is what’s going to drive profitable growth. Customer obsession will drive profitable growth. And it’s worked right. We used to be not profitable. Now we’re profitable, full stop. And we used to be not growing so much, and now we’re growing a lot. So anyway, so I think all the questions you’re asking get at the same fundamental premise, which is, can you really be a customer-obsessed organization and grow as a result profitably? And we’re trying to demonstrate the answer is yes. ALISON BEARD: So on that note, Shazab is asking, how do you ensure that your 1.5 million driver contractors, who are gig workers– they’re not employed by Lyft– live and embrace your customer experience obsession? DAVID RISHER: Ah, this is a very cool question. This is a very cool question. And I’m going to answer the question, but I’m going to give you– I’m going to tell you you’re in good company for asking this question. So first of all, let me say this– service, of course, doesn’t just mean, what happens when you’re in the car. It means, for example, after I open up the app, what’s the estimate I’m going to get? How fast am I going to get picked up? Let’s start with that. So right now we pick you up about a minute faster, on average, than we did a year ago. That’s about 40 faster than our biggest competitor, which is actually quite an accomplishment. So before I get to the answer, I will just note that “service” means a whole lot of different things. It can mean, for example, does your driver cancel on you, which is quite irritating? And you might– interestingly enough, it’s actually hard to detect in the data how irritating it is because people tend to get rematched, and a car eventually picks them up. But people find it very frustrating. They don’t like the idea of– and you’ve probably seen this yourself. It says, oh, we’re finding a new ride. It’s not a great experience. So anyway, that service experience starts from the second you pick up the app. But now to the center of your question, now you get in the car. The car pulls up, and you get in the car. And I find this a very, very interesting question of how can– we do all kinds of things today. Let’s just start with level set. So we have what’s called a driver education center, a coaching center. I’m a driver myself, as I said. I just got a prompt yesterday to go in and review some videos and stuff. In a week– actually, we haven’t said this publicly yet, but I’ll say it now because why not– we’re actually starting a new driver podcast, which I think will be very cool because drivers, of course, spend time in the car. And it’s actually not– it’s produced by Lyft, but it’s actually drivers talking to– its two drivers, a man and a woman, talking to each other about how to deliver great service and how that connects to great tips. So that’s cool. And then we also have various incentive programs and bonuses and so forth and so on if you do certain things and don’t do certain things. So there’s a whole, as you can imagine, machine behind it. But I still think the question is even more interesting because– and I’ve asked this very same question. I happen to have had the very lucky experience of getting to talk to Thomas Keller a couple months ago, who runs The French Laundry and then just completely coincidentally to Eric Ripert, who runs Le Bernardin in New York, so two three-star Michelin restaurants. And I asked both of them exactly the question you’re asking me. I said, how can we, as a company, coach, cajole, encourage, whatever it is but create a service culture, a service ethic among the 1.5 million drivers that drive on our platform that’s at the same level, same consistency, maybe not five-star, three-star level but a consistent level, that you do in your restaurants? And both of them– it was so interesting. You know the difference in a question you ask, and the person is– they give you a rote answer and like, whatever. But this was the opposite. In both cases, they leaned into this and spent another five or 10 minutes saying, that’s a mind-blowing, mind-blowing idea. Like, how can you get at that level the type of service that we get? So that was a very, very long way of not answering a question. I don’t actually know yet. I can tell you some of the things we’re working on, and some of them I’ve already mentioned. But I think it’s one of the things that’s going to, I hope, set us apart and make us an industry leader in this group, in this area. ALISON BEARD: I’m sure that driver experience, customer experience is going to play a big role in your answer to the next question. But it is a really good one, and it’s certainly one on everyone’s mind. Two people are asking it. Jordan asks, how does Lyft differentiate itself from its biggest competitor to encourage consumers to switch? And an anonymous viewer asks, how did you position your company to compete so well against a robust, name-recognized competitor? And kudos to our very polite audience for not mentioning the name of the competitor. But that’s the question for you. How are you battling this dominant force in your industry? DAVID RISHER: Sure. So again, it is a good question, and it’s quite hard. It’s quite hard, particularly when some of our drivers drive on both platforms. The car is the same. So it’s quite an interesting problem. I’ll go back to the same thesis. So you mentioned also that I was on the board of Lyft for a couple of years before joining the CEO. And it’s quite interesting and, of course, a separate issue of the perception you have of as a company– of a company as a board member versus inside. I will say, as a board member, I believed the company was customer-obsessed, and I was asked to be on the board to push that idea at the board level because boards often think about finance and strategy, not so much customers. But I came to believe over the course of the two years I was on the board before joining as CEO that customers– and then when I joined the company as CEO, I realized, no. Not that we were not but that, gosh, we were a bunch of different things. We were many– we were trying to do too many things all at the same time and maybe not– not maybe not. I’m sorry– definitively not really obsessing over our customers. We were pricing too high. We were paying too little. Our reliability wasn’t so great, on and on and on. And so the answer to your question– again, it comes to the same. Our purpose is to serve and connect. Let me start with those two words, “serve” and “connect.” And I want to serve riders and drivers better than they’ve ever been served before, and I want to connect them with the people and places they love. That’s big, big picture, what I want to do. And that’s what we’re doing. So I’ll give you some evidence that we’re beginning to make some inroads against those other guys. When I joined– let’s look at two statistics. When I joined, our share was about a 26, maybe 27, now, most recent, about a 30, 31. That might not seem like a big change, but it’s a big change. In Canada, we’ve gone from being irrelevant to having our ride volume double and double again. That’s been 100% a street fight against the other guys because we weren’t really there, and then we entered seriously about a year ago. And now we’ve been– And again, so some of it comes from differentiated service, things like Price Lock, Women+ Connect, a product I started, actually, on the first day I was here that lets women drivers and riders choose each other, a product that’s coming out next week. I’ll give you an early preview. It’s called Lyft Silver, which allows old people to have a simplified version of the app, and you can invite them to be part of the app and even pay for their ride if you’re maybe a son or daughter, caregiver. So some of it’s product differentiation. Some of it’s partnerships. We have partnerships with a company called Bilt, for example, or a company called, well, Chase Sapphire Reserve. Many people probably have their credit card or– in the audience. So some of it’s that. We have these sorts of partnerships that give us exclusive or preferential access to certain customer sets in return for certain things. Some of it’s brand, an area, actually, we haven’t actually invested that much in recently, but you’ll see more of that later this year and next year. So again, maybe a little bit of an “all of the above” thing, but the through line through all this is we want to level up the service that you get by far, by far and really redefine it. And here’s where I’ll end. On the driver’s side– and this is probably the area where we’ve made the most progress– because of things like earnings guarantee, because of– and this earnings commitment and a set of tools around that and various other things we’ve done, we now have a 20-point advantage, 20-point advantage over the other guys when drivers are asked the question, which company would you prefer to drive from, 20 points. So step by step by step, by treating them well, by obsessing over drivers and riders, that’s how we’re getting there. ALISON BEARD: So you’ve been a change agent in the company. When you took over as CEO, you wanted to execute a turnaround that included layoffs at the start. How did you make the very difficult decisions in that scenario and then communicate them to the workforce? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so it was very difficult but in a weird way kind of straightforward. And this is what I mean. So my first day was April 17, 2023, and I had actually been coming in for the prior– call it two months, on Thursdays and Fridays. So that my first full-time day. And within the first, say, six weeks, we had announced a couple of very significant things. The first, as you mentioned, was quite a significant layoff. It was 26% of the workforce. Now, that’s devastating. That’s devastating. But– or and, I guess I should say– the framing that I gave was, this is the only way, only way that I know how to pay for the things that we are going to do for our customers, for our riders and drivers, which is to say, lower prices to be competitive and raise pay to be competitive. And I was– and of course it was devastating, of course, for the company and particularly because the company had gone through layoffs in the past. But I will say– and I don’t think this is just people telling me what they thought I wanted to hear– even some people who left the company, who were asked to leave the company or told to leave the company, said, I hate it, but I get it. But I get it. If we want this company to survive, you got to make these types of choices, and it’s the type of choice that maybe we needed to have made in the past that we didn’t make with such clarity of purpose, which was so that we could provide better service to riders and drivers. The second thing, just to walk down that path for a couple more steps, I said is– and remember, you have to put yourself back in 2023. We’re all coming back to work three days a week. Now, this was an interesting decision because at the time it was not obvious that that was maybe the right thing to do. And in fact, the company had in the past said, we’re going to be remote first, as many companies did. Now, obviously, a lot of companies since have also done the same. But I bring this up because I thought of it as a very important cultural moment for us as well, to say, if our purpose is to serve and connect and we’re about getting people out of the house and dealing– all these sorts of things, we can’t just do it remotely, and we’re not going to come up with our best ideas. And we’re not going to– it’s very hard for that– again, you can look at the data screens. But to get that real feel of what drivers and riders really will respond to without the whiteboard sessions and all the rest, so that was a very important second thing. And then the third thing that we announced– it was all right in these first couple of weeks– was a new product called Women+ Connect. This– I mentioned this before briefly– allows women riders and drivers to choose each other. And this was something I actually started on the first day. It was actually 10 o’clock in the morning the first day I was here. And the reason I thought it was so important is because it was an idea that had been kind of floating around for a while, and people had always come up with a way to say no to it. Ah, it’s complicated, or there’s legal issues, or this or that, all sorts of things. And I’m like, yeah, but on the other hand, 25%– excuse me, 50% of our riders are women, roughly, and 25% of our drivers are women. And they’re telling us guys, when we listen, that they’re not always comfortable, particularly late at night or particularly in a new city. They’re not always comfortable. So what are we doing here? So anyway, we pushed through some of those objections and talked about the risks and characterized them in certain ways and did the technical work. And I think it was six months later, in August, they came out with a– came out with the product. And it’s been very popular. It’s actually one of our most popular products, particularly for drivers. Once they turn it on, they never turn it off I go into detail on this because I wanted to say from the beginning, it’s not just about cost-cutting. It’s cost-cutting for a reason– we can do better for riders and drivers as a result. And we’re going to grow too. We’re going to innovate. We’re not going to let this stall us, and we’re going to do it together. ALISON BEARD: That’s good advice for anyone who’s trying to lead a change effort in any-size organization or team. So Martin asked, would you consider onboarding autonomous drivers, i.e., cars without driver, and Wendy asks, how does Lyft view the Waymo disruption, continuing to innovate toward that future trend, while balancing your current business model and offering and assuring support to your current drivers? [00:28:23.75] DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so great questions. So the answer to the first is yes, we will absolutely welcome autonomous vehicles onto our platform. In fact, we’ve already announced an agreement with a company called– with a company called May Mobility that operates or will operate in Atlanta later this year, actually this summer. They operate Toyota Siennas in self-driving mode. And we’ve announced an agreement with Mobileye, which is a technology company that produces autonomous technology that will be installed in a to-be-named OEM, to-be-named car that will also be on our platform. And I think, if I zoom out for just one click, autonomous vehicles, self-driving vehicles are absolutely going to happen. In some places, it’ll happen fast. Here in San Francisco, they’re happening quite quickly. In other places, it’ll be slower. But it’s going to happen. So then the question is, well, how do you really embrace it? How do you bring them onto your platform in a way that hopefully expands the market, which– we’ve actually seen some evidence of that, which is great– is respectful and acknowledges the fact that you’ve got millions of people driving on the platform too? So how do you work with them through this transition period? And then how do you make sure that you’re not accidentally being disrupted out of business? Waymo is a very interesting company. Perhaps at some point they’ll be a partner of ours. Right now you might see them as a competitor, a small-scale competitor. But still, they’re doing stuff that competes directly with us in some of our markets. So it’s no exaggeration to say it’s probably the thing that I’m thinking about the most and our board is the most engaged with, but I’m quite optimistic that under 99 scenarios out of 100 it turns out to be actually quite accretive for the industry because it gets– remember, people take 160 billion rides a year in their own private cars. Rideshare is only three billion between us and the other guys. So there’s so much opportunity for other people driving you and that experience being part of people’s lives that I tend to be much more focused on how to take advantage of that market share expansion than I am about fighting a particular battle with a particular competitor or something like that. ALISON BEARD: OK. This is another anonymous viewer asking. He’s clearly done his research. He says, from your wiki page, an impressive career advancement, Microsoft, Amazon, and now Lyft. It’s clear that your bosses have loved you. What characteristics do you think set you apart from others? DAVID RISHER: Wow. That’s like a– it’s like an Oprah Winfrey-style question. ALISON BEARD: I know. I love it when they get personal. I do love it when they get personal. DAVID RISHER: Honestly, it’s maybe easier for me to turn the question around just a little bit and say what I learned at those places. What I learned from working at Microsoft– and I didn’t work directly for Bill Gates, of course, but I did have enough interaction with him to get a sense of who he was and what his values and focus was. He was a very competitive person, and so I learned how to compete hard. I really did. And that was very important learning. And then I also learned a lot about taking technology, from a guy named Todd Nelson, actually, my boss for a long time at Microsoft, taking technology which can feel a little obscure, particularly back in the ’90s, and making it personal and trying to understand it at a personal level, not just at a technology level. I think I did work directly for Jeff Bezos for quite a long time at Amazon, and customer obsession really did come from him. He understood early on the internet everyone’s a click away from everyone else, and so if you don’t– there’s no such thing as an undifferentiated competition. You have to differentiate in order to compete. Otherwise, people go to something else that’s better, so anyway, that real focus on customer obsession. And then I ran Worldreader for a long time, the nonprofit I founded, and there I was my own boss. I was my– well, my board was boss. But really what I learned there is this idea of leading with purpose and that you can get people– you have so few tools in the nonprofit world. You have small salaries. You don’t have stock. But you do have purpose, and if you lead with purpose, gosh, people are willing to do amazing things. So maybe those are some things I’ve learned over the years. ALISON BEARD: I really like that you turned a question asking about why you’re so amazing to talk about why your bosses were so amazing and what they taught you. And so I think maybe what characteristic is most salient for you is that you’re a learner. You’re curious, and you’re picking up lessons from other people. OK, this last question– and it’s just a one-word answer– what’s your Lyft driver rating? DAVID RISHER: 5. [CHUCKLES] ALISON BEARD: I’m not surprised. All right, David, I’m sorry that we’re out of time. It’s really been a pleasure talking with you today. Thank you so much. DAVID RISHER: Alison, I’ve had a ton of fun. Thanks for the great questions from you and from the whole audience. It was great. ALISON BEARD: That was Lyft CEO David Risher in conversation with me at the 2025 HBR Leadership Summit.

Title: Despite $2M salaries, Meta can't keep AI staff — talent flocks to rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic

I think we're in the wrong industry. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As companies pour billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, demand for AI talent to program and run these AI data centers is also greatly increasing. Deedy Das, a Venture Capitalist at Menlo Ventures and a former Google Search staff member, posted on X that Meta has an over $2 million annual pay package for AI talent, but still keeps losing its people to OpenAI and Anthropic. He said that he’s personally heard three such cases this week alone, which is major news given the size of Meta’s compensation. Statistics say that for every 10.6 from DeepMind, 8.2 from OpenAI, and 2 from Hugging Face that move to Anthropic, it only loses one employee for each company. This movement shows that the startup is quickly growing and that many people from competing AI labs want to work for it. We don’t know how much the company offers, though, but we can safely assume that it’s at least on par or, more likely, substantially larger than what the competition pays. According to the SignalFire research, beyond salary, Anthropic's edge is a unique culture that embraces "unconventional thinkers" and gives employees true autonomy, as well as flexible work options, a lack of title politics and forced management tracks. Furthermore, employees report an embrace of intellectual discourse and researcher autonomy, compared to bureaucracy elsewhere. Meta is currently offering $2M+/yr in offers for AI talent and still losing them to OpenAI and Anthropic. Heard ~3 such cases this week.The AI talent wars are absolutely ridiculous.Today, Anthropic has the highest ~80% retention 2 years in and is the #1 (large) company top AI… pic.twitter.com/YSv5UNV5H2June 10, 2025 Aside from this, Das also mentioned that Anthropic has an unusually high two-year employee retention rate. The tech industry average is around 40% to 50%, with the retention rate dropping over the past couple of years due to layoffs. However, many AI startups’ two-year retention rates vary between 63% and 80%, with Anthropic holding the top spot. Next to it is Google’s DeepMind, which has a retention rate of 78%. Many new employees who work in AI labs also come from major tech giants. It’s estimated that 5.4% of new hires come from Google’s non-AI divisions, while 4.3% are former Meta staffers. A further 3.2% used to work with Microsoft, and another 2.7% are ex-Amazon employees, while 2.1% were previously affiliated with Stripe, and 1.7% came from Apple. This accounts for nearly 20% of new employees in AI labs that have come from tech giants. Massive tech companies used to be the dream job for many people, especially as they offered competitive pay, strong career growth, many opportunities within the industry, and prestige. However, 2024 was a bad year for the tech sector, with many companies laying off thousands of people. Intel was one of the biggest losers, with the company laying off 15% of its workforce (roughly 15,000 employees) after its disastrous August 2024 financial report. However, other companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Dell, and AMD were also hit with workforce reductions. On the other hand, the continued growth in the AI sector is pushing many talented individuals towards these startups, as shown by the data. This will likely continue in the near future, as companies and nations continuously build more and more AI data centers. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

June 11, 2025 06:52 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA PARIS, June 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA GTC Paris at VivaTech — NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk to accelerate drug discovery efforts through innovative AI use cases. The work supports Novo Nordisk’s agreement with DCAI to use the Gefion sovereign AI supercomputer. The companies aim to create customized AI models and agents that Novo Nordisk can use for early research and clinical development and to apply advanced simulation and physical AI technologies. “AI is essential for every industry, and there’s no other field that will benefit more from acceleration than drug discovery,” said Rory Kelleher, senior director of business development for life sciences at NVIDIA. “Working with Novo Nordisk, we’re advancing critical R&D applications with fundamental tools that can harness the full potential of generative and agentic AI to improve pharmaceutical development.” Novo Nordisk Taps Advanced AI to Accelerate InnovationDCAI’s Gefion supercomputer, powered by NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™, provides Novo Nordisk an AI factory for running drug discovery and agentic AI workloads. Novo Nordisk will use NVIDIA BioNeMo™ for generative AI-powered drug discovery, NVIDIA NIM™ and NVIDIA NeMo™ microservices for building customized agentic workflows, and the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform to create physically accurate simulation environments for developing physical AI applications. Novo Nordisk researchers will focus on several AI research programs, including using single-cell models to predict cellular responses to drug candidates and structures, as well as designing models to build molecules with drug-like properties. The companies will also collaborate on tapping Novo Nordisk’s vast global scientific literature to build biomedical large language models, enabling researchers to uncover correlations between genes, proteins and diseases. “By coupling NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform and expertise with Novo’s deep expertise in life sciences research and development, we aim to build custom models that will aid our scientists in developing new medicines faster and more efficiently,” said Mishal Patel, senior vice president, AI and digital innovation at Novo Nordisk. “Gefion will allow us to run experiments at an unprecedented scale.” Advancing Denmark’s Healthcare EcosystemDCAI owns and operates Gefion, Denmark’s flagship AI supercomputer. DCAI is helping lower the barrier for accessing advanced computing capabilities and enabling companies in Denmark to pursue research and development across healthcare and drug discovery. “With Gefion’s computational power, we can tackle the toughest R&D challenges, with the ultimate goal of unlocking new possibilities for pharmaceutical research and development,” said Nadia Carlsten, CEO of DCAI. “By combining Gefion’s capabilities with NVIDIA’s expertise, our customers can accelerate innovation even further.” Gefion has already been used by multiple customers to advance healthcare and drug discovery. Teton, a Danish startup and member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, is tapping into Gefion to accelerate the development of its AI care companion for hospitals, using cameras and sensors installed in patient rooms to create real-time 3D digital twins. This allows nurses to monitor patients remotely and receive alerts about potential health issues. Teton’s technology aims to reduce workload burden on nurses — freeing them up for higher-value tasks — and improve patient care, with early trials showing up to a 25% reduction in nightshift duties. Last month, DCAI announced that one of the first pharma companies to use Gefion will tap the supercomputer to accelerate drug discovery and development in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Another venture-backed company is using Gefion to accelerate the development of oral alternatives to widely used biologics and to target proteins that are currently difficult or impossible to drug with available compounds. Gefion will also be used as part of an effort by Danish health organizations to unite previously siloed health data into a single national analysis platform, which will provide researchers with secure access to interconnected health data. Along with supercomputing resources, this will make it easier to analyze large datasets, identify disease patterns earlier and develop more personalized treatments.

June 11, 2025 05:57 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA PARIS, June 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA GTC Paris at VivaTech -- NVIDIA today announced that it is teaming with model builders and cloud providers across Europe and the Middle East to optimize sovereign large language models (LLMs), providing a springboard to accelerate enterprise AI adoption for the region’s industries. Model builders and AI consortiums Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Bielik.AI, Dicta, H Company, Domyn, LightOn, the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS) together with KBLab at the National Library of Sweden, the Slovak Republic, the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), the University College of London, the University of Ljubljana and UTTER are teaming with NVIDIA to optimize their models with NVIDIA Nemotron™ techniques to maximize cost efficiency and accuracy for enterprise AI workloads, including agentic AI. Model post-training and inference will run on AI infrastructure in Europe from NVIDIA Cloud Partners (NCPs) participating in the NVIDIA DGX Cloud Lepton™ marketplace. The open, sovereign models will provide a foundation for an integrated regional AI ecosystem that reflects local languages and culture. Europe’s enterprises will be able to run the models on Perplexity, an AI-powered answer engine used to answer over 150 million questions per week. Companies will also be able to fine-tune the sovereign models on local NCP infrastructure through a new Hugging Face integration with DGX Cloud Lepton. “Europe’s diversity is its superpower — an engine of creativity and innovation,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Together with Europe’s model builders and cloud providers, we’re building an AI ecosystem where intelligence is developed and served locally to provide a foundation for Europe to thrive in the age of AI — transforming every industry across the region.” Optimizing Model Accuracy and Inference Savings With NVIDIA Nemotron Europe — the world’s third largest economic region — is home to industries spanning manufacturing, robotics, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, finance, energy and creative. To accelerate the region’s AI-driven transformation, NVIDIA partners are delivering their open LLMs with support for Europe’s 24 official languages. Several models also specialize in national language and culture, such as those from H Company and LightOn in France, Dicta in Israel, Domyn in Italy, Bielik.AI in Poland, the University of Ljubljana and the Slovak Republic models, BSC in Spain, NAISS and KBLab in Sweden, TII in the United Arab Emirates and the University College London in the U.K. The LLMs will be distilled with NVIDIA Nemotron model-building techniques — including neural architecture search — as well as reinforcement learning and post-training with NVIDIA-curated synthetic data. These optimizations will reduce operational costs and boost user experiences by generating tokens faster during inference. The Nemotron post-training workloads will run on DGX Cloud Lepton hosted by European NCPs including Nebius, Nscale and Fluidstack. Developers will be able to deploy the sovereign models as NVIDIA NIM™ microservices running on AI factories — on premises and across cloud service provider platforms — using a new NIM microservice that supports more than 100,000 public, private and domain-specialized LLMs hosted on Hugging Face. Adding Europe’s Sovereign AI Insights to PerplexitySupporting AI diversity for enterprises across the region, Perplexity will integrate the sovereign AI models into its answer engine, which is used by European enterprises, publishers and organizations, including telecommunications and media giants. Perplexity uses LLMs to improve accuracy in search queries and AI outputs. The answer engine draws from credible sources in real time to accurately answer questions with in-line citations, perform deep research and complete assistive tasks. “Perplexity’s goal is to provide accurate, trustworthy answers to any question from any person, wherever they are,” said Aravind Srinivas, cofounder and CEO of Perplexity. “Bringing NVIDIA-optimized sovereign AI models to Perplexity empowers innovation in Europe with AI built and running in the region.” AvailabilityThe first distilled models from Europe’s model builders are expected to be available later this year.

NVIDIA is establishing and expanding AI technology centers in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, the U.K. and Finland. These centers build on NVIDIA’s history of collaborating with academic institutions and industry through the NVIDIA AI Technology Center program and NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute to develop the AI workforce and scientific discovery throughout the regions. “Every industrial revolution begins with infrastructure. AI is the essential infrastructure of our time, just as electricity and the internet once were,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With bold leadership from Europe’s governments and industries, AI will drive transformative innovation and prosperity for generations to come.” “France is committed to investing in AI to strengthen our economy, benefit our citizens and uphold our values,” said Emmanuel Macron, president of the French Republic. “By working closely with our nation’s leading technology innovators and NVIDIA, we are equipping researchers, entrepreneurs and public institutions with the tools they need to explore new ideas, tackle complex challenges and help shape the future of AI for France.” “Just as coal and electricity once defined our past, AI is defining our future,” said U.K. Tech Secretary Peter Kyle. “NVIDIA’s expansion of its technology center here in the U.K. will be vital in helping us to deliver on our AI ambitions, and their partnership in building the capabilities that will transform our AI Growth Zones into engines of opportunity. This is our Plan for Change in action, bringing together leading innovators to build the compute infrastructure that will drive growth across every region and secure the U.K.’s place as a global AI leader in the age of AI.” “This agreement represents a strategic step toward strengthening Italy’s technological sovereignty and ensuring that our businesses have secure and competitive access to data management,” said Minister of Enterprise and Made in Italy Adolfo Urso. “The collaboration with top-tier partners such as NVIDIA and Domyn confirms the government’s commitment in supporting high-level alliances to foster innovation and the competitiveness of the national production system.” Building Europe’s Foundation for AI Infrastructure and InnovationBuilding AI infrastructure requires strategic investment in advanced systems, land and facilities, sustainable energy access, skilled experts and partnerships. To accelerate the development of these national resources, NVIDIA is working with leaders across France, the U.K., Germany and Italy. In France, Mistral AI is working with NVIDIA to build an end-to-end cloud platform powered by 18,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell systems in the first phase, with plans to expand across multiple sites in 2026. This infrastructure will enable organizations across Europe to quickly develop and deploy AI using optimized Mistral AI models and validated AI factory designs, accelerating the adoption of agentic AI applications. In the U.K., NVIDIA is collaborating with NVIDIA Cloud Partners Nebius and Nscale to unlock advanced AI capabilities for enterprises and businesses of all sizes. At London Tech Week, the cloud providers announced the first phase of their AI infrastructure development plans to deploy 14,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs to power new data centers, making scalable, secure AI infrastructure widely accessible across the U.K. In Germany, NVIDIA and its partners are building the world’s first industrial AI cloud for European manufacturers. This AI factory will be powered by NVIDIA DGX™ B200 systems and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers featuring 10,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs to enable Europe’s industrial leaders to accelerate every manufacturing application, from design, engineering and simulation to factory digital twins and robotics. In Italy, NVIDIA is working with Domyn and the government to advance the nation’s sovereign AI capabilities. Domyn is developing its Domyn Large Colosseum reasoning model on its supercomputer, Colosseum, with NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchips, in alignment with its mission to support regulated industries in adopting AI. European Telcos Build AI Infrastructure With NVIDIA for Regional EnterprisesNVIDIA is also working with leading European telecommunications providers — including Orange, Fastweb, Swisscom, Telefónica and Telenor — to develop secure, scalable sovereign AI infrastructure across the region. These collaborations enable enterprises to develop and deploy customized AI models and agentic applications at scale, tapping into telcos’ extensive networks and trusted role as critical infrastructure providers. NVIDIA AI Technology Centers Fuel Research, Upskilling and Scientific ProgressNVIDIA is establishing and expanding technology centers in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, the U.K. and Finland to accelerate AI skills development, research and infrastructure for the continent’s enterprises and startups.

Now, let’s get into the show. Hello, everybody, and welcome to another episode of JUST Branding. Today, we are very, very excited because we have the one and only Rory Sutherland on the show. Rory, if you’ve never heard of him before, where have you been? He is the vice chairman of Ogilvy UK, where he spent, I mean, it says down here the last three decades, but he doesn’t look that old, so I’m sure that’s not the case. The last three decades applying behavioral science to some of the world’s biggest brands. You will know Rory from his best-selling book, Alchemy, which I’ve got here, and if you haven’t read that, you definitely need to, his TEDx talks, which have racked up over 15 million views, and his uncanny knack for turning irrational ideas into astonishing commercial results. In our conversation today, we’re going to be focusing in on problem framing and this idea around reframing problems so that constraints become creative springboards that spark different questions and help brands come up with more valuable answers for their consumers. More on that later. Before then, Rory, welcome to the show. Thank you for coming on. Ah, it’s a pleasure. What a joy. Really happy to be here. Firstly, just to give us a snapshot of, for those people that maybe have been living under a rock and have never heard of you, give us a bit of a snapshot of your journey and how you became sort of focused on behavioural science. Very simply, my first job was other than driving a forklift truck at the Ribena factory when I was a student and working for my dad who was self-employed. My first sort of full-time job was in what was then called Ogilvy and Maither Direct, now called Ogilvy One, which was the direct marketing wing of Ogilvy and Maither at the time. That was in 1988. And it was an incredibly lucky and fortunate place at which to start work because, of course, it was that part of advertising which was measurable. By the way, you know, there was a downside to that. And I’ll come to that later, which is the good thing about measurement is you can compare what’s working and what’s not working and what’s working better. The bad thing about measurement is you’re never allowed to do anything you can’t actually measure, which is, if you like, it’s a double-edged sword. However, what we were doing was effectively behavioral economics avant la lettre. We were performing enormous randomized control trials of both creative and media and targeting and measuring the comparative effect of different changes, which very, very quickly caused you to realize that what motivated people to do things, what was important in terms of a marketing communication, wasn’t necessarily either what research would tell you was important or what rational economic models would tell you was important. So you would repeatedly find utterly bizarre effects. One of the earliest ones was a simple test for what was then called British Telecom, where if you sold a product and you allowed people to respond by phone, you got a 2% response rate. If you allowed them only to respond by post, all other things being equal, you got a 4% response rate. And if you gave them the choice of both, you got a 6% response rate. I think I’m 0.1% off on a few of those figures, but I haven’t got the data anymore because this was 1989. But that’s the kind of thing that you’d find. Now, an economist would accept the fact that there’s something called transaction costs. You know, people are happier engaging in one, responding in one medium rather than another. And therefore, that’s not going to be negligible. But that finding that 2 plus 4 equals 6, that effectively every additional channel of response you offer creates more response, is something which has… I always argued then, look, these things… I said, there’s a science here for which we have no name. In other words, really understanding what it is that drives people to change their behavior, as opposed to falling back on rational-seeming theories about what matters. And it was only years later when I discovered accidentally the existence of behavioral economics, nudge theory, Kahneman, Tversky, Arielle, Thaler, et cetera, Sunstein. It was only then that I realized that there were a tiny group of people engaged in this thing, and it did in fact have a name. And I always thought it had a vastly greater importance. David Ogilvy would have been the same. David Ogilvy always said people should start by working in direct response advertising because it gives you a effectively an instinctive feeling for what works. And so that was the thing that really… And of course I was in the right place at the right time. You know, I already knew quite a bit. In fact, when I eventually met Thaler and Kahneman and people like that, what was quite surprising to me is I had interesting things to say to them, and they were interested in what I had to say, because I was party to all kinds of experiments which weren’t in the academic literature because they were in the commercial field. Amazing. Amazing. Well, you’ve sort of touched on it there, this idea of problem framing, because this is something I know that you speak a lot about in your book Alchemy, and it’s kind of a key thing that we want to tuck into with you today. So perhaps before we get into some details, let’s sort of start high level for folks, perhaps, who are just kind of grappling with this for the first time. Well, how would you sort of describe problem framing and specifically, I mean, our audience are all trying to build brands or involved in brand building strategically somehow. How is problem framing helpful for, say, somebody who’s trying to build a brand to think through? Okay, I’ll reframe this, which is only appropriate. Go for it. Which is to say that how is not problem framing an issue in business and indeed governmental and institutional decision making. In other words, if you don’t spend time, famously, I think Einstein said, if I had something like an hour left to save the world, I’d spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute solving it. It’s understood in mathematics, obviously. Mathematicians would understand this instinctively, that if you can redefine the question, you’ve given yourself a second chance at solving it. And not doing that by effectively saying, we have to solve every problem through brute force methods. And if you rewrite the brief or redefine the problem, you’re cheating. That is hugely problematic because I think that’s an instinctive thing which has come to us through our educational system, which is, I’ve been given a problem, the problem contains all the information that I need to solve the problem, and there’s a single right answer. That’s your typical high school multiple choice maths question. All right? I mean, interestingly, by the way, a few people I know have had an issue with IQ tests because they say an IQ test to make it easy to mark is multiple choice, and when you have multiple choice answers, by definition, the questions can only have one right answer. And so there is this fundamental tendency where I think we take the problem as it is currently defined, we work on it using the approved sequential logical methods for proceeding from that definition of the problem. And whatever is our best shot at it following that process, we then deem to be not only right or interesting or worth testing or worth exploring, we deem it to be the only right answer. And the point I’m making there is that actually, in many cases, the problem isn’t as currently defined, or by describing the problem in a different way, you arrive at a completely different avenue for exploration. Okay? So two things that are problematic there. One, people have this instinctive feeling that if I redefine the problem or rewrite the question I’ve been given, I’m cheating. Okay? That’s true in a maths exam or whatever. You’re not allowed to do this in, you know, history 101. I don’t really like that question about the Norman Conquest. So I’m going to answer a question about the Roman invasion. Okay? That’s obviously a con. But actually, in real life problem solving, that’s exactly what you often need to do. That’s the first part. The second point is, and this is a really important one, particularly in any institutional setting, okay, is that if you want to signal that you care about a problem, you naturally want to tackle the problem head on in the most obvious way possible, okay? We have a problem with not enough luggage going through X-ray machines in airports. Therefore, we must hire more security staff. And it’s a very, very fashionable belief, which, you know, and generally it involves the trade off or there’s a cost attached. And it’s a very, very logical way to solve that problem, okay? Because you’re doing what effectively is a direct head-to-head conflict, with the problem as currently defined. With all the parameters that are already in place. So I’m going to give you this example. When you go through airport X-ray machines, one of the most common problems that happens, and it’s interesting who notices this and who doesn’t, is that people start taking their jackets and belts out of the trays as soon as they emerge from the X-ray machine, okay? The problem that creates is that they’re effectively holding up their tray so that no future trays can be scanned. Now, what you’ll occasionally notice is that there’s a shrewd person who understands the sort of systems thinking who stands close to the X-ray machine and whizzes the trays along the conveyor belt to the far end, so that there’s the maximum buffer available for trays to come through and be scanned, and then five people can be removing their belts and jackets and bags in parallel, rather than one person doing it in series. Okay? Now, the way, you know, before you hire more X-ray staff or spend another two million pounds on an amazing scanning machine, maybe you ought to be just instructing the staff who are currently there to actually whizz the trays along to the end, so that the retrieval process can happen in parallel rather than in series, so the throughput of the X-ray machine without any expenditure on money or staff can be trebled. Okay? And so, that will be the typical example I’d give, where it’s very, very easy. One, people think they’re cheating if they change the question, but actually the only thing that matters is the objective, not really the question, and even the objective is open to debate. Okay? When you have a proxy objective, generally, it’s quite arbitrary. Okay? You know, we need to make this brand appeal more to young people. Well, you know, it would be an absolutely, you know, almost stereotypical form of client paranoia. And therefore, the natural thing to do is to do ads which very explicitly say, hey, young people, you love this brand. Quite frequently, because of the fibles of human psychology, what that creates is a kind of reactance. Okay, which is you’re trying too hard, disco, vicar, you know what I mean? You know, it’s the whole thing of, you know, you don’t look now, but your strategy is showing. Yeah. Now, there may be lots of ways you can appeal more to young people. I once had this thing where we noticed, you know, we don’t, you know, we’re not selling that much to the young. And I said, young people have yet less money than old people. Why don’t you just try offering Klarner? So, you know, what I’m saying is that, and I think it’s really important, because one of the things that really bothers me about this whole business is, ever since the advertising business was paid by the hour, it lost something, which was, first of all, clients didn’t engage you very early on because they didn’t want the meter to start running. Whereas when you were paid on commission, they got in touch with you day one because after all, you were free until they actually bought some media. All right? The second thing is that consequently, because of that general impatience and the idea that efficiency is on time and in budget, that’s the kind of goal. We’ve lost what I call the exploratory phase, and we’re more and more inclined to rush into dumb execution. One of the daft things I think we’ve also done is create a planning department, which instead of working in parallel with the creative department, works in advance of it. Howell-Henry spotted that this was a fault, and they created a kind of five-person team that worked on the whole problem from soup to nuts, which always struck me as a fundamentally useful idea, which produced, by the way, very, very interesting advertising. You know, it was empirically quite a successful approach. But for whatever reason, nobody’s actually, you know, nobody’s really replicated this. sponsored message Yeah, it’s funny, isn’t it? Because one of the things that I like as a sort of a solo consultant is that I get to do that. You know, I kind of, people will approach with, as you get this idea that we have this problem. And I always say to my clients, look, you know, it may well be that we have, that is the problem that you’ve discussed. But before I just take that and start trying to solve for that, can I interrogate it a bit? I want to go talk to some customers, talk to your staff, talk to your leadership team. And then we’ll settle on that, you know, and then we’ll explore a solution further once we verify that that is a problem to attack. So Roger L. Martin talks about this sort of very narrow island of factual data surrounded by a sea of uncertainty. And for some reason, we feel we have to start the journey from that island, even though it’s a very restrictive and narrow place from which to start. The analogy I use, which is where I think people get it right, and where I think people, sometimes highly intelligent people get it wrong, is if you look at police work, they accept if you’ve got a criminal you’re trying to catch, they accept that there are two phases to the investigation. There’s the investigative phase, and then there’s the evidential phase. Eventually, you’ve got to prove the guy’s guilty, right, in a court of law. And to prove the guy’s guilty, you’re not allowed to use anecdotes, you’re not allowed to use entirely circumstantial information. But you are allowed to use that information in the investigative phase. So the standard police question would be, if someone’s weirdly found dead in a downstairs basement flat, would be to go next door and to ask the neighbors, did you notice anything unusual between the hours of, you know, 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. on, you know, on the third of whatever. Now that’s a totally open-ended question, okay? The answer could be literally anything. And it’s almost certainly not going to have any evidential value. I heard a scream at 11.30. Well, that narrows down your time of day, possibly, if you believe they’re telling the truth. I saw a strange man in a white van drive up repeatedly, and he kept driving back dozens again. You can’t imprison someone for life for driving a white van in a funny way, although, probabilistically, it wouldn’t be a bad approach, actually, given the serial killer’s love of the white van. But you can’t reasonably, you know, imprison someone for that. That has no evidential value, it has a minor evidential value. But it really tells you, let’s look at the CCTV and see if we can see any white vans that re-appear more than once and find out if the person driving said van is somehow a bit iffy. Now, again, we’re not yet in the evidential phase, we’re just in the exploratory investigative phase, but we’re allowed to use information there which isn’t entirely robust. And that’s only correct. And similarly, you know, what you will probably do in the course of investigation is you will redefine what you’re trying to do several times in the course of that investigation. You know, first of all, it’s find something unusual. Secondly, there’s a line of inquiry around white vans, okay? Thirdly, you would probably, if budget allows, you’d also say, let’s also proceed on the basis that the white vans are relevant, because we could be missing something here. Okay? That could be coincidence and it could be meaningful. And so the whole thing is an iterative process. And what we’ve tried to do is turn it into a linear process because, and I’ve got a theory about this, which is one of the reasons why ad agencies don’t experiment very much with their process, is because we’ve got to justify our activities to some procurement department, who want to know what we’re doing for every second the meter’s ticking. And we have to maintain the pretense that every single step of this journey is a sequential stepping stone towards this somehow singular and miraculously perfect solution. Consequently, if you come up with an interesting approach like Howell-Henry, with five people working in parallel, procurement probably won’t accept that because they’ll say, we need to be able to compare your costs on a like-for-like basis with every other agency that’s pitching for this count. So innovation is not allowed because it destroys our ability to compare on very narrow cost metrics. It strikes me that a lot of these supposedly well-intentioned parts of business actually have extraordinary dangerous unintended consequences because when you take a business and you optimize for only part of it, and you do so basically with the aim of self-justification, it’s highly likely that you’re over-optimizing what you need to lay claim to and under-optimizing other important facets in any decision. There’s a great book now by Margaret Heffernan, which is called Uncertainty, I think. And it’s basically a plea for people and organizations to accept existing in a state of uncertainty. Because what we do is a large number of people find being in a state of indecision or uncertainty deeply painful. Yeah, it’s like a psychological… It is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I desperately need to pretend I know what’s going on here. Or I desperately need to pretend I can make a plausible story up to explain what on earth happened here. And therefore, we rush to kind of what you might call pre-rationalization. Yeah. I once heard it. It’s like, you know, in the ancient maps, where, you know, they sort of hadn’t explored areas, they would like just draw a little dragon in the corner. Here be dragons. Here be dragons. It’s that sort of idea, isn’t it? It’s like we don’t like being in the dragon pit. Like we want to be in a land where we know for sure where we are. So, yeah. Jacob, do you have a question to lead the conversation forward? Yeah, Rory. So, hi, Jacob here. I want to jump into some practical tools and examples that we could use. So, if a team is feeling boxed in by a brief, like what’s an exercise or something you would do to shift their mindset? Is it like a question or a template or how do you start that shift? Well, it doesn’t have to shift their mindset at all. You could shift their behavior and then their mindset will follow. So, actually, we know this from quite a lot of evidence in brain science that quite often attitudinal change actually lags behavioral change. In other words, I like this because I do it as opposed to I do this because I liked it in advance. And by the way, there are rational reasons for this, which is once we have experience of something, we often like it more than we expected. Okay. And the classic case of behavioral change versus attitudinal change, which I think is relevant to the electric car industry as well, is I don’t know how this applies in Australia, probably exactly the same way. British people for years were hugely resistant to automatic transmission in cars. Oh, no, no, no. I like, I like that. The sense of control, that’s something Americans have. No, no, no. I can’t stand the idea of an automatic car. Okay. No, no, no. I like the feeling that I can change, you know, da-da-da-da-da-da. And they all came up with these after, and you couldn’t change their minds, really. Okay. Until they drove an automatic car, at which point nobody ever went back. Okay. Don’t get me wrong. Okay. If I moved to the north of Scotland and I lived sort of half a mile from the A9, and I had rolling highland roads with no traffic on, and I had the joy of double-D clutching, okay, I might, might go back to a manual car. But for all practical day-to-day purposes, once you’ve had an automatic, you never go back. And once you’ve had one pedal driving in an electric car, you never go back. Driving a car is just mildly irritating. So it isn’t necessarily the job of assuming you have to change someone’s attitude to something in order to get them to do it. Sometimes you get them to do it in order to change their attitude to it. Now that strikes me as hugely important. And I’ll give you another example of this. So one of the things that does is it does actually change our attitude to sales promotion. Not necessarily to boring money off sales promotion, which I think can be good, can be bad. It’s not inherently bad, but it should be the, the last resort should be bribing your people to buy your product, okay? But it does, for example, when we talk to Great British Railways, one of the things we’d say is, look, there are something like 70% of the population are what’s called rail rejectors. Some of them have good reasons. They live in a part of the country which is totally all served by rail, for example. Okay, fine. But there’s this huge percentage of people who don’t like railways because they never use it, okay? And there’s a famous joke line about Guinness, I’ve never tried it because I don’t like it, okay, right? And in a sense, those people are caught in a kind of mental loop of they don’t use the railways, so therefore they’ve never had any incentive. Why would I have an incentive to have an opinion that conflicts with my existing behavior? So in Denmark, what they do is they give everybody free rail travel on their birthday. Now, I would argue there’s a whole chunk of people. One of my ideas was increased car tax by 100 pounds a year, but give every person who taxes their car 150 pounds worth of off-peak rail vouchers to use whenever they like on any off-peak train, i.e. train that isn’t already crowded. I mean, those journeys are more or less free anyway, because you’re moving trains around the country full of fresh air. And so the incremental, the marginal cost of an extra passenger is zero. And my argument for doing this is that if you make four train journeys a year, next time you have to make a journey, at least rail is in your repertoire. It’s in your consideration set. Not saying you’ll go, I’m not suggesting people will go, oh, this is total epiphany. I’ve seen the lights. I’m selling my car and I’m going to go everywhere by train. It’s simply the fact that they will now consider the train as an option because they’ve had experience of using it under reasonably benign circumstances. They can see the benefits of the train and they can see the downsides of the train. Whereas people who only use a car just have imagined downsides of the railway. Also, the first time you use a train is a painful experience because everything is unfamiliar and you need to work out where to park and where you buy a ticket and how much it costs and where you stand and all that stuff, which when you’ve used a train five or six times, then becomes system one rather than system two. It becomes then relatively instinctive and a bit painless. So I wouldn’t even start from the assumption that you’re trying to change someone’s attitude. I’d just say there is somewhere there is a behavioral bottleneck in the system, which we need to use whatever tools are available to address. Then you have to ask your secondary question, which is, is that the real bottleneck? Which is there’s no point in getting people to think differently about something if it doesn’t translate into behavior. So if the real bottleneck is, you know, so this is really important, by the way, because you can identify what appears to be a pinch point in your business. But if there’s an even worse pinch point upstream or downstream, I’m a big fan of that book by Eli Goldratt called The Goal, which is all about bottleneck theory effectively, which says that in any system, that the performance of the system is usually constrained by its narrowest point. Now, that originated in what you might call manufacturing processes or chemical processes. He’s a, Goldratt was a hard-hitting physicist, you know, a serious guy, right? And then people realized that actually also applies upstream to demand. It’s not just a question of manufacturing and production. There is probably one thing, which is the single point at which it pays you most to intervene. Now, at which point, if you free up that bottleneck, a bottleneck may appear somewhere else. So you have a very weird thing which happens in, I think, the electric car market, which is the first bottleneck was there was huge demand for electric cars in the very early days from earlier doctors, techno geeks, etc. The bottleneck was you couldn’t produce enough cars, and so there were waiting lists. Then about 10 electric car companies came on stream with massive production of electric cars simultaneously, and the problem was there was a glut. Okay? So, you know, you literally have those issues where, at any one time, where the bottleneck lies may actually change. And therefore, framing the problem, because it’s important to consistently kind of evolve as you are sort of solving one bit or reframing one bit. It might pop open another bottleneck somewhere else, I guess, is what we’re saying. sponsored message Absolutely, yeah. So what I’m saying is there’s no point in widening a road if there’s a badly phased set of traffic lights 200 yards further on. All you do is you move the traffic jam somewhere else on the road, and you don’t actually increase the throughput of cars at all. So Rory, let me ask you a question. So let’s bring this down into your world in Ogilvy or in terms of what you’re doing. Can you give us an example or just sort of maybe it would help if you could kind of show us, say maybe where you got a brief through or something through where there seemed to be problem A, but by reframing it, re-exploring it, it changed the outlook and changed the outcome of the project. So Say Mate to a Mate, which is a campaign for the Mayor of London, which created a lot of controversy. And actually the controversy was interesting because a lot of people said that by proposing a relatively small intervention, we were making light of a problem. Okay, but let me explain the logic here. We did huge numbers of interviews with people in the kind of target audience. And what we found is that it was designed to effectively diminish or provide a reasonable solution to what you might call male-on-female misogynistic bullying. Okay. Now, what emerged from that is that that kind of behavior where people are casually misogynistic, either in the presence of women or in their absence in some cases. Okay. Most men don’t like it, but they didn’t have a mechanism for criticizing it in their friends without coming across as holier than that. Without coming across as patronizing, because what you can’t do if your friend engages in casual sexism, some shape or form, most men don’t support it, don’t agree and regard it as bad behavior, but you can’t suddenly read out a Guardian editorial, okay, to your friend because your friendship has an inherent value. Quite often, we tolerate quite a lot from our friends because that’s what friendship means. And so the whole idea which embraced, for example, comedians talking about it, it embraced a whole lot of a poster campaign, it embraced every form of medium suitable was actually involved in this. Okay. Now, I think it’s particularly important because you could argue it’s a version of broken windows theory. Look, it’s not going to stop. This campaign is not going to stop Fred West, okay? It’s not going to stop Peter Sutcliffe in his tracks, okay? But you could argue that those behaviors start somewhere and they start small before becoming bigger and bigger. And so the whole point about MATE is it’s a form of censure or criticism, which doesn’t actually make the person you’re criticizing. It doesn’t actually, effectively, it’s a corrective. It’s an internal corrective from a group of friends who would prevent that. Because some of that misogyny is probably performed for bravado, okay? They think they’re impressing their friends and their friends aren’t actually impressed. And so it’s interesting because some people said, no, no, no, we need to spend the money on street lighting. Well, arguably, everything starts somewhere. But secondly, the whole point was, it was very interesting that two people who supported it, I think, were, interestingly, Piers Morgan and Caitlin Moran, were two people who said, I get it, that works to me, that makes sense. And actually, two people who, whether you like them or not, I think are astute. You can say whatever you like about those two people. But they’re highly astute and they’re not formulaic thinkers. They will actually take a completely kind of a bleak opinion on things. They were two people who actually supported the campaign. The people who disliked the campaign were people who effectively felt that the only solution to any problem had to be head-on. And actually, human psychology, in many cases, keep off the grass is not a very effective communication. You know my story about, please turn off your mobile phone on entering the restaurant. We immediately think of reasons why it shouldn’t apply to us. Whereas the brilliant restaurant in Santimedia, which had a sign ostensibly aimed at people leaving the restaurant, but actually visible to everybody walking in, which said, please remember to turn your mobile phone back on when leaving the restaurant. By effectively suggesting a social norm rather than by imposing a rule, okay? The emotional response to that message, although both of them are in service of the same aim, the emotional response to the message is completely different. Now, you know, if you’re a hardcore person who says the only way to stop people turning their mobile phones on, okay, is by a direct instruction. Or an economist would say you have to fine people, okay, for using mobile phones. But actually, there’s a perfectly gentle way of doing this, which is just to say that if your mobile phone goes off during the meal, you know, in this fancy restaurant, or, you know, it might be considered a bit of a faux pas by the rest of the diners. And therefore, it’s a question that you’re actually, the notice is saving you from embarrassment rather than issuing an edict. And consequently, our emotional response is very, very different, even if the ultimate intent of the message is exactly the same. So going back to that brief for the mayor of London, then, how did that go then? You know, I know it was controversially received, but like, do you know of the data of the outcome of that campaign? I will seek to find out. It will take time because that’s, that’s one of my criticisms I will make about one of the problems working in direct marketing and one of the problems about this false claim of quantification we’ve made about marketing is a lot of the value of marketing takes time to emerge. Definitely. It’s exponential. The value of fame, for example, is really a compounding effect. It’s more like a pension. You know, as you become more famous, it becomes easier to become more famous. Okay. So these things are not linear and they’re not immediate, but we will measure it as far as we possibly can. By the way, I mean, you know, we ought to remember that there are some things which are very difficult to measure. If you obsess about the speed of measurement, and it’s worth remembering there’s a double problem there. Things you can measure very fast tend to be acquisition focused, bottom of the funnel. Okay. And because you can measure them fast, you get results very fast and the level of attribution is very precise. Any investment in customer service is likely to be slow and less attributable. Consequently, one consequence of this is that almost all companies, I would argue, that are obsessed with justifying their own existence in the marketing department are over invested in acquisition and under invested in customer experience, loyalty and retention and repeat purchase. Right. Because it goes back to that point you were making earlier that if you’ve experienced a train ride and you’ve know that that’s going to take some time. So, you know, yeah, absolutely right. It takes time for them me to get on the train and then have a couple of turns on that. I have a good experience. Then I, you know, tell someone else about it and then start actually planning that into my behavior going forwards. It does take behavior change takes time. Yeah, absolutely right. Yeah. And so it’s slow, you know. And so if you think about it, any significant behavioral change involves someone, A, in the early days, it involves people breaking with a habit and doing something altogether unfamiliar. And B, doing something which other people aren’t doing. Now, there is an interesting issue, which is sometimes called crossing the chasm, which is there is a group of people in any particular field who love doing things that other people aren’t doing. But there are a minority of people and they aren’t necessarily where the market value lies. And so you could argue that this very early group of people who are obsessed with buying electric cars, who were both novelty seekers and very high on openness, and to some extent perhaps slightly more individualistic. They want to stand out rather than fit in. Okay. Those people create an early ground swell of uptake for electric cars, which then doesn’t cross the chasm into the mainstream in part sometimes because the user imagery of early adopters might be quite strange. Okay. So a classic case of that was you had early people who bought Apple Vision Pro, okay, who then started walking around the streets of Manhattan wearing an enormous pair of goggles. It happened apparently famously with Google Glass. They only gave Google Glass out to developers. So the earlier adopters became known as glass holes. And what you need to do is you need to mainstream something. And sometimes the enthusiasts who are your first customers are actually in some ways almost negative ambassadors. Interesting. So how do we do that then, Rory? How do you mainstream something in that regard? I suppose you’ve got to normalize it somehow, haven’t you? Yeah. I mean, okay, with electric cars, one of the things I’ve made this point repeatedly in the hope that the industry picks it up, it’s a lot easier to reduce anxiety than it is to increase range. You know, increasing range, you’re dealing with the laws of physics, which are quite difficult to, I mean, there are wonderful ideas in chemistry and battery chemistry, which I’m sure can further increase the energy density of batteries. I’ve got no doubt about that. And indeed, it’s worth spending billions and billions of dollars looking for exactly those ideas. But at the same time, it’s a lot cheaper and quicker just to make people with a car with a range of 170 miles, say, or even 120 miles, stop feeling so goddamn anxious. So how do you do that? Well, two obvious ones. There are more, okay? One of them is you reduce any legal restrictions within reason on signage directing people to electric car chargers. So if you need planning permission to put up a sign that says car charging, okay? That’s a problem because electric car chargers are literally only 5 percent as visible as petrol stations are. There are actually more rapid chargers. By the way, Jacob, slight apologies for this because I accept the fact that in Australia, or in certain parts of Australia, this situation is different, okay? Because Australia is what geographers technically call very, very big. In fact, I think you’re in the 30 countries in the world with the lowest population density, aren’t you, in Australia. So you have massive cities separated by enormous distances. You know, that’s like the US similarly, Canada similarly, okay? I accept the fact that what I’m saying, so I’m just going to, you know, but in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, okay? High density population countries that are, you know, relatively small in size. Range anxiety is, I think, a virus we’ve caught from the United States, where it’s a rational fear out there. It’s not really a very rational fear in the UK at all. Because, I mean, apart from the else, in the US, they need 100 and I think that the statistics I went and found is, in the UK, we’ve got eight and a half thousand gas stations to serve a population of 60 million. And in the US, they’ve got about 350 million people, which is five times as many. They actually have 116,000 gas stations. And the reason is they need gas stations to serve a geography, not just a population. With the possible exception of the far north of Scotland, there’s no where really in Britain where you’re 50 miles from a place of major habitation. Okay, I mean, literally, there’s, you know, there are still black spots, by the way. I mean, those need to be ironed out. But one of the things would be you can just go to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay and just say, can you just add for anybody driving an electric car, a little panel that says nearest high-speed charging five miles ahead. Next, three available out of five, you know? Okay, just continue to reassure people. The other thing is you don’t need the bloody battery to say, your battery charge is 87%. Okay, I do need, when I get down to 11% charge, I need individual digits. 80% plus would be fine. I don’t need to be made conscious of the fact that I’ve lost a bit of juice when I’m at 80% already and I’ve just taken the kids to school. I don’t need that to factor into my thinking any more than I did when I had a petrol gauge. Yeah, because petrol gauges don’t give you the percentage, do they? No, it’s just three-quarters full, full, half full, eight full, the light’s gone on. That was it. That was the level of granularity we needed. There are lots of ways in which you can stop. The other one, by the way, is very simply, I hate to say it, but if you have extended test drives for electric cars, people can basically get addicted because once you’ve driven one, you’d have going back to petrol field stupid in a weird way. Nothing to do with environmentalism, by the way. In fact, I think the environmental message might have actually set back electric cars by five to 10 years because a lot of people interpreted them as an unfortunate compromise that was being forced on them by tree huggers, rather than the first major step forward in automotive traction in 90 years.

Get on the waitlist now at joinbba.com. Now back to the show. Yeah, Rory, everything you said here resonates because I bought an electric car a couple of years ago and have experienced all of these things, just the… What did you buy, by the way? What did you get? It was a Polestar. So, yeah. They’re very good. I hired one of those in Italy. I thought they were excellent. We had a good fun. And yeah, we have a petrol car as well. And going back to that, it’s like you don’t want to go back. And it’s just sluggish, loud. It’s like, why would you? I mean, the thing that happened was interesting, is the intention was always, I’ll get an electric car, my wife will get a petrol car, so we’ve got one of each. And then basically, once I got the electric car, we liked it so much, we ended up with two electric cars. Her car is Mini, it’s a Mini Cooper electric. It’s only got a range of, it’s one of the earlier ones, so it’s only got a range of about 110 miles, slightly less in cold weather. But actually, for all practical intents and purposes, it has proved that has been an issue, i.e. the need to recharge en route happens about once every, twice a year, something like that, no more than that. Yeah, I’ve only charged it once on the road and I’ve had it for a couple of years. I’ve never really experienced it. But actually, by the way, I think the government and various people unfairly vilified hybrid cars, because they didn’t understand the fact that the hybrid, for someone who’s an Australian, the plug-in hybrid, I mean, is not a bad thing because 99 percent of your journeys are taken care of by plugging in and getting 50 miles, 60 miles of range. I mean, sometimes the great is the enemy of the good. That’s another issue I’d raise with things like, an example of that would be heat pumps. People come to you and say, we’re going to have a perfect heat pump solution. Now, and I go, well, look, if I can reduce my gas consumption by 70 percent, and it costs me 4,000 pounds and I can do it one stage at a time. Okay, that’s pretty good. Okay, I’m not Greta Thunberg, but I’m doing a bit and it’s all in the right direction. What that probably means is I install four air conditioning units, which you mostly use as air to air heat pumps. I don’t know if you do that in Sydney. If it gets cold in Sydney, do you reverse your air-con so it warms the house? Yeah, we do. Yeah. Now, it’s actually a super-efficient fan heater, probably when it’s super hot outside, sorry, when it’s super, actually in Sydney, it’s going to be perfect. It’s not going to be that cold outside, right? It’s not like Canada, okay? Actually, it’s like a five times efficiency fan heater. So it probably takes in two kilowatts, it could be producing eight, okay? Something like that, okay? When you reverse your air-con. Now, in the UK, we don’t get any subsidies for installing air-con, even though my father, in his nineties, he was a bit frightened of a heat wave, understandably, because they kill you in your nineties. You know, if you can’t cool off, it’s really, really risky. So we bought him, my brother and I bought him an air conditioning unit for his main room. He didn’t want one for his bedroom or anything like that. Actually, because he’s actually in very hot weather, he’d sleep downstairs where the air-con was, right? One air conditioning unit. Now, you don’t get a subsidy for that because they go, oh, no, because you might use it for air conditioning and it’s actually creating new energy consumption. Mate, he lives in Wales, right? Okay. Heat waves in Wales are going to be about five days of the year at most, maybe 10, 95 percent of the time, my dad was using that air conditioning unit as an incredibly efficient way to heat his main room. As a consequence, he had a gas heater in the room, which he never used. Great. Well done, dad, okay? But no, because it’s not perfect, and because for five days of the year, he was committing the absolute sin of being a 90-year-old using air conditioning to stay alive. Okay? Right? So these people are not looking at this problem holistically. And so you have this problem. I think there are some areas of activity where we should be increasing carbon consumption. For example, if you can produce steel using coal to produce the blades for a bloody, you know, obviously, they’re not steel. Okay. But, you know, what I mean is to produce the blades for wind power. And that’s the best way of producing wind turbines or the belt, you know. There are cases where we should be perfectly happy with carbon use. Okay. The UK has already done really quite well. I mean, I think we’re just beating ourselves up now. We do have a major problem with this, don’t we, in the UK? We do beat ourselves up loads. And this is a major topic for international listeners in the UK around steel, because all are still working on closing down in the name of green energy. But the problem is, is then we still we haven’t all agreed to not still use steel. So we’re importing it, which therefore is actually, I mean, I’m not an economist by any stretch of the imagination. But my understanding is, it’s actually causing more of a problem with the carbon footprint, importing it all. So we kind of shot ourselves in the foot kind of thing with this. Also, the legislation is such a blunt instrument compared to marketing, because the great thing about persuasion is that you’ve got a good reason not to be persuaded. You can ignore it, right? Legislation or economic incentives impose themselves on people who should not be affected by them. This is my great argument for marketing as the first port of call for problem solving. So let me give you an example of this. If you are a retired person who’s got an 11-year-old petrol car, which is reasonably economical, okay? And about three times a week, you drive to the shops, and once a year or twice a year, you drive to see your cousin at Christmas, you know, or whatever, you know, 120 miles away. But your annual mileage is like 1500, 2000 miles. You should not be in any way encouraged to buy an electric car. Because a battery that could be used by someone who’s actually driving 10,000 miles a year, namely me, is now sitting outside a cottage somewhere in the middle of the country. Okay? Doing absolutely soddle for 99% of the time. So the fundamental point is that, I’ll give you an example of this. It’s a good idea to put, for people to put their tumble dryers, washing machines on late at night, because there’s less pressure on the grid. So the electricity produced at 11 o’clock at night is probably cleaner. Although there are other arguments, it can be Sunday lunchtime. But let’s not worry about that. Okay? Now, if you say it’s a good idea to do that, do that if you can. Lots of people who find it easy to do can do it. Everybody else goes, well, as it happens, I can’t do that. Now, the first thing, if you create like really expensive, becomes really expensive to use your tumble dryer, okay, until 10 p.m. or 9 p.m., okay? The first call you’ll get if you instigate that legislation is from the London Fire Brigade, who will say, people who work nights will now feel compelled to put their tumble dryer on and leave it in an unoccupied house, where they are a not irrelevant fire risk, okay? Tumble dryers catch fire, particularly old ones, particularly the least economical ones, okay? They catch fire. Secondly, you’ll be encouraging people who live upstairs, their kitchens upstairs from their next door neighbors’ bedroom, to put their washing machine on at 11 o’clock at night, so it hits the spin cycle at two o’clock in the morning and their neighbors come and beat them up, okay? The great thing about persuasion is if you’ve got a good reason not to be persuaded, you ignore it, okay? That’s why persuasion is organic and legislation and economics tends to be physics, okay? Right? One of them is organic change, the other one is kind of what you might call Newtonian change. Input here, output there. And actually the only way we’re going to solve this problem is organic change unless you’re happy to live in a country which is literally so oppressive that you spend 30% of your time doing utterly stupid things because you’ve got no choice. This is what you’re talking about, unintended consequences, isn’t it? You know, in all of these things, you’ve got to think that through across everything. And I think this is really important, because I think there’s an awful lot people can do voluntarily. I mean, there are a whole lot of things about solar panels, okay? Okay, now, I imagine you’re in Sydney. Someone in Germany has obviously got this right in some way, because Germans are using solar panels all over the place. Okay? Now, one of the things you could simply do, okay, is simply describe the value of solar panels to people who have investments using the language of APR. Okay? Now, admittedly, it’s not a compound effect, but if you spend a thousand pounds on solar panels, and they save you 18% of the amount you spend is saved on an electricity bill every year, there’s not much in the stock market at the moment that’s going to give me a guaranteed 18% return in terms of a dividend, right? Okay? So if you basically say this is an investment with a really good dividend, and actually a lot of pensioners who can, now in the UK, you can take a lump sum out of your pension tax-free, and arguably 10% of this, one of the things I say is actually you can take a further 10% out of your pension tax-free if you spend it on renewable energy. And then you’ll get a load of oldsters, often in big houses, which they are effectively saying, okay, that’s actually a way I can make my pension go further, is basically by not having to spend very much on electricity, on heating. Right. And they do that voluntarily, you’d imagine, rather than by… Yeah, but it’s still voluntary. So incentives, by the way, incentives can be voluntary. We’ve got to be careful about that. Okay. Because an example would be, nobody… We’ve got a housing crisis. There’s a very reliable bit of data which shows that nobody downsizes voluntarily, unless they do it by the age of about 72, 73. Once people hit 73, they just stick in their house, for whatever reason. Even if their house is much too big for them, even if logically they know they should move. And I think there’s a reason for that. I think when you’re 73, you’re not confident enough in your future health to say, well, if I move now, I’ve definitely got another eight years in my smaller house. You think, oh, I might spend all this cost of moving, all the cost of moving, and then I’ve got to move into sheltered accommodation three years later. I can’t be bothered. I’m going to eek it out as long as I can. Okay. Now, probably what you should say is that if you have a couple with nobody else living in the house and they downsize when both of them are below the age of 74, you should say, no stamp duty, okay? If you’re buying a less expensive house and you’re selling a more expensive house, then basically you’re excused stamp duty on the new house you’re buying. And then you say, but there’s a window of opportunity, which is if you leave it until you’re both 74, windows closed. Now, that’s an acceptable, okay, it’s not a nudge because it is actually an economic incentive, okay? But it’s an economic incentive being used to its maximum psychological effect. Rory, can we switch gears and talk about the future a little bit? You know, AI is a hot topic, so let’s dive into that. So like AI and data-driven tools, they’re taking over marketing is like heavy lifting. So where do you see human reframing adding the most value brands? Okay, this is the first time I’ve said this, but I’ve been thinking about this a bit over the last few weeks. Now, this already happened in the UK in the 18th century with the Industrial Revolution and the capability to mass produce things at scale at vastly low expense. So the pottery industry, for example, or operated historically a bit like Fabergé eggs. You went along, you said, I’m an immensely rich person, and I would like to commission an egg. And Fabergé would go and produce an egg, and hopefully you said, ooh, Carl, that’s a really lovely egg, and then you pay him a stack of money for it. Or you might argue about the egg for ages and go, no, that’s not the egg I meant at all, go and make another fucking egg. Right? Now, when Wedgwood, and it’s worth noting that the Industrial Revolution sort of started in things like pottery and textiles, you know, in other words, you know, but the mass production of both furniture and pottery. So Chippendale, in the case of furniture probably, Wedgwood, that was when modern marketing was invented because you suddenly said, well, we can produce so many effing plates. There’s no point in us waiting to be asked. What we have to do is produce a load of plates in advance and go out and find if anybody wants them. Okay? You reverse the direction of travel. Now, it occurs to me that in creative agencies, what we should do if we’re using AI correctly is we say, we can now generate interesting interventions and ideas and effectively mock them up to a high level of finish, much, much faster than we could previously. Now, we will still need judgment. It wasn’t that Wedgewood just produced random plates. Okay? They had very, very good designers who went and produced a very good plate design, usually based on some Chinese theme. Okay? And then bang them out in huge quantities. And then you made more of the ones people liked and less of the ones people didn’t. I would argue that the ad agency, the creative agency is still operating like Carl Fabergé. They’re waiting to be asked. They’re waiting for a client to come along with an RFP. They’re waiting for clients. And the reason I partly started the behavioral science practice is I said, look, the fundamental problem of this business is nobody’s got a budget for a problem they didn’t realize they had. And so a large part of what we do in Ogilvy Consulting, I would argue, is diagnostic. And actually, in nearly every case, we find something a business is doing, that if they just stopped doing it or did more of something else, they would be much better off. I think we’ve got to change the whole way the ad industry works, so that you actually produce advertising campaigns and ideas and ads and everything else. You produce them and then you find a market for them. I think we’ve got to reverse the direction of travel, because otherwise, if we’re still waiting to be asked, all we’ve done is commodify ourselves, okay? No one’s going to pay us any more money because they go, well, look, we know you can do this in three days, so why should we pay you for 15 days work, okay? It’s going to be a fucking disaster unless we actually reinvent what we do, and that requires a fundamental creation of a different kind of ad agency. Now, that’s one possibility. The second possibility is even more extreme, which is that when everybody you’ve ever met or had any commercial contact with can generate enormous amounts of sort of mere content at almost nil cost, then the competition for individual human attention, when you remove that level of friction that was involved in content creation, simply becomes intolerable to all consumers. The only way you do it is you do an advertising agency backwards, which is the consumer appoints an advertising agency to keep them informed of interesting and stimulating things. And so you reverse the direction of travel, which is it’s the consumer appointing an agent on agentic AI to go and look for goods and services, rather than the goods and services looking for the consumer. Love that. And I can see now that that actually, to some extent, goes back to the early days of the Internet when it was predicted, but never happened, OK, with things like the Clutrain Manifesto, written by Doc Searles, markets the conversations, OK, was one of the, was effectively one of the sort of axiomatic points made in, in the Clutrain Manifesto. And there was a prediction a long, long time ago, using a phrase which I haven’t read in print or pixels for 5 or 10, 15 years, the infomediary. In other words, it’s an agent, an informational agent operating at the behest of the buyer, effectively, looking for people who might sell to it, rather than the seller looking for people who might buy from it. That reminds me of something, Rory. So these days, there’s agents on job boards. So you’d hire an AI agent to go find an agent. So it’s getting quite meta rather than a person. It’s kind of what it reminds me of. They will be having conversations with other agents, I suspect. And then the whole question. I mean, it’s a strange thing if you think about it with the property market, that the property market only works in one direction. Typically, there are exceptions. You can appoint a buyer’s agent, and that happens at the level of very rich people. Okay. Just before we close, Rory, question. If somebody is building brands, thinking through a problem and listening to this podcast, what would your top three tips be to somebody in that state where they’re grappling with something? What would you recommend for folks to think about? I’m thinking three quick fire tips from Rory on problem reframing. The first thing is stop talking about what a brand is and talking instead start talking about what it can do. Because one of the problems I think and one of the reasons I think we undervalue brands. And Matt Johnson, who wrote a book called Brands Mean Business, a fantastic book, he’s a neuroscientist. His phrase is, having a great brand means you get to play the game of capitalism on easy mode. In other words, people inherently trust you more, people are happier basically making an impulse purchase from a brand than they are from someone they’ve never heard of. People are happier working for that company, people work longer and probably for less money for that company, that company that embellishes people’s CVs. When the company CEO rings somebody else up, they return his call. So a brand has an effect in lots and lots of ways, which I think grow, by the way, exponentially with brand fame. Okay, and we shouldn’t be afraid of simply saying a large part of branding is being famous. It can be being niche famous or it can be being broadly famous. Depends on what kind of business the brand exists to serve. But the first point I make is that one of the things I think we tend to do is we tend to have a very Newtonian approach to investment in brands, which is we define what the brand activity is supposed to do very narrowly, and we then measure the value of that activity only to the extent that it obtains the objective we defined in advance. So all other positive spinoff benefits of that investment in branding, of which I would argue there are almost certainly many, okay, all of those get lost because we’re defining in advance what we want that this thing to do. We also, I would argue, also tend to measure the value of a brand relative to competing brands, okay, Samsung versus LG, okay, when the real value of a brand consists in having a brand at all, okay. So all of you, both of you, I think, if you went to buy a television and there was a television from Samsung or LG, you would pay a couple of hundred bucks more for that television than you would from a television from a brand you’d never heard of, right? Equity, yeah. Just because they’ve got reputational skin in the game, you know, they have more to lose from selling a bad product. They have, you know, they are reputational fragile. There’s a limit to how bad any of their products can be. You know, I bought lots of things from Samsung. Some of them are good. Some of them are very good. Never bought anything from Samsung that’s terrible, right? Okay. Now, all of those things effectively allow you to command a fairly significant premium in the marketplace. But what we’re doing is you’re often comparing one brand versus another competitor brand, whereas, of course, the real value of the brand consists in the fact that you are actually famous, okay? A lot of that is hard. It’s harder to measure the effect that a brand has on price premium versus sales. So, you know, in many cases, we’re looking for brand value and completely the wrong place. But the other thing is, don’t ask what a brand is, ask what it can do. And actually, then you realize that you can use your brand in multiple ways, okay? And I would actually argue, there’s a very, very astute guy who is called Dale Harrison on LinkedIn, who’s a B2B marketer and an absolute genius, in my opinion. And one of his points is, it’s completely wrong to measure marketing investment on the basis of ROI. Yeah. He says, there are lots of areas of business expenditure which you engage in. So he said, if you were building a factory and someone said, we need to put a roof on the factory to stop the machinery getting wet, nobody would say, I need you to give me the ROI on the roof, okay? It is just a necessary component of whatever it is you do. Okay. And consequently, this ROI thing, we effectively thought, wouldn’t it be great? Wouldn’t it make our lives so much easier as marketers if we could actually quantify the value of everything we did? Well, unfortunately, the downside of this is that in the act of quantification, we’re almost certainly undervaluing or misrepresenting the value of everything we do. And we made it impossible to do anything that you can’t measure. Back to my initial point about direct marketing, you’re never allowed to do anything you couldn’t quantify. Yeah. And so you go, hey, I think it would be great. Okay. I think it would be great if we sent our customers a birthday card or a Christmas card. How will we measure the effect on that? Well, you could measure the effect on it. Obviously, you could take 50% of your customers and not send them a birthday card and see if there was any. One very interesting thing, which I don’t think has been experimented with nearly enough, by the way, is there’s a small business I buy from in Kent, occasionally buy clothes from. And I suppose I’m quite a regular customer of theirs. And at Christmas, they literally sent me just a box of goodies. It was probably 20 or 30 pounds worth of goodies. Now, to be honest, if I’m being really cynical, it might have been stuff they weren’t going to sell or they weren’t going to sell very quickly or whatever. But it was nice stuff like water bottles. And actually, you know, I gave some of it to my kids. I kept some of it myself. Now, it occurred to me that I don’t know if they’re testing that to see what effect it has. But it’s interesting to me that one thing I would like to test for a lot of brands is an act of fairly extreme generosity. Now, obviously, it has to make economic sense over time, okay? But if that means I order four times from that brand every year rather than twice from that brand every year, they’re in quite a high margin business, to be honest, okay? It’s sort of relatively expensive clothing or things of that kind. Then actually, that 30-pound investment, which to me was the most amazing bit of marketing I’ve received in about, you know, 10 years, is actually not particularly expensive. You know, it occurs to me that the finance people are going to hate this idea. I think there are a whole load of things in marketing which we’ve never tested that might really, really work. And the reason we’ve never tested them is not because they don’t work, because it’s too hard to prove that they do, or too slow to prove that they do. Yeah, yeah, it’s a major… We are obsessed with ROI, aren’t we? Absolutely, in this game. Okay, the other thing is we’re obsessed with data, but as Roger Martin says, there’s no data about the future. And strategy fundamentally is about the future. Definitely. There’s data which is indicative of possible futures, okay? But there’s no data about the future. And so this quest for certainty and our obsession with avoiding ambiguity and avoiding being in a state of uncertainty and ambiguity is really, really critical because everybody effectively in business now is involved in an arse-covering exercise under the guise of rigor, to be honest. We’re back with the dragons. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah. Brilliant. Well, look, I know time is virtually up, Rory, and I just want to thank you personally for… It was great. We met last year in Manchester, and it’s so kind of you for agreeing to come on on our little show. Final kind of question, if folks want to connect more with you, understand more about your thinking, follow you in any way, like how can we digest Rory Sutherland’s content? Where do we go to? I mean, YouTube appears to be the repository for most things. TikTok is also searchable if you want short form at me. I also write an article, Fortnightly and the Spectator, which I’ve done for about 15 years. So if you go to spectator.co.uk, you can search by author and you’ll have effectively, two hardback books worth of various spectator writings over the last 12 or 13 years, quite heavily on behavioral science and technology. Because the interplay between them obviously fascinates me because when you think about it, okay, the most interesting thing you can imagine about the mysteries of psychology is, a company as rich as Apple and as intelligent as Apple, can produce the Apple Vision Pro, okay, and literally launch it with absolutely no idea whether the thing is going to be popular or not. Now, I would argue that the only answer to that question of what is, you know, and by the way, I have a very, very interesting take on a lot of those technologies, which is, if you read a book by Andy Clarke called The Experience Machine, his hypothesis is that most of what we perceive is a prediction, and we simply use our optic nerves and our auditory function and smell and everything else to revise for prediction error, okay, very much like a JPEG, you have an expectation value for each pixel, and you only use data to the extent the pixel differs from the expectation value, okay? And that means you need much less bandwidth to actually construct a view of the world, okay? Because you don’t have to look at everything in raw mode, afresh every millisecond. You can’t, it’s impossible, right? It’s impossible, impossible. You couldn’t process it, it’d be a totally inefficient use of bandwidth and data, okay? So instead, we’ve got a JPEG, Consciousness is an SNMPG, you know, at some level, okay? By the way, I think that probably explains why magic works, by the way, magic tricks, why they work. It also, there are some other wonderful demonstrations of things which, there’s a particular sort of noise, which is totally like white noise, until you put the text underneath and then you can hear the whole sentence, okay? You know, it explains Mondagreens, you know, how you mishear. Have you ever heard, it’s a Brenda Lee and it’s a Christmas song, and almost everybody British hears the lyrics as, Later, we’ll have some f***ing pie and do some caroling. It’s actually pumpkin pie, but my hunch is that because British people aren’t really familiar with pumpkin pie, we actually hear, I don’t know whether there’s a transatlantic difference in terms of that mishearing, but it’s a prediction, right? What we’re perceiving is a prediction, right? And so sometimes you want, sometimes I would argue, you want to optimize for surprise and sometimes you want to optimize for predictability depending on what you’re trying to do. But what was I going to say there? Oh yeah, that once you understand that, you’ll have to look at what we do differently, fundamentally. The reason I bring that back to Apple Vision Pro is I don’t think 3D vision is actually much of a thing. I think most of the 3D-ness in our environment, if you close one eye, okay, it’s not like you lose that much perception about your environment. I’ve now got my right eye closed. My right eye is a bit f***ed anyway because I had a detached retina. But with my right eye closed, I can perfectly well see where things are placed in relative. I wouldn’t be very good at putting a pen top back on close. And I probably wouldn’t be great at catching certain cricket balls because of that. I’m not saying that 3D vision is irrelevant. I’m saying it doesn’t play that bigger part in our perception. And consequently, actually, I think augmented reality, I think they need to… If you notice, 3D cinema becomes a thing about every 35 years. And that’s because a generation grows up who’s never learned to find it uninteresting. And then it becomes a novelty and then it dies off. And 35 years later, someone else goes, we’ve got to do this 3D. Now, there is an Apple thing called Google Starline, Project Starline, which is 3D video conferencing one-on-one, which is interesting because it may have psychological effects where it’s less tiring, whatever it may be. I don’t know. But my argument is that 3D is just not that big a deal in terms of human perception. And actually in a weird kind of way, we don’t want it. And I think the only way to understand that is understanding Andy Clarke’s notion that it gets into really deep stuff like free energy principle, which I don’t know what to think about. I can’t understand it. But ultimately, I think Andy Clarke’s book is really accessible and it makes its case very, very well. Amazing. Amazing. Brilliant. Well, look, Rory, thank you so much for giving up your time for coming on. We really appreciate you. I would also add to your comment that folks should get this book, Alchemy, which Rory has written and it’s fantastic, full of amazing insights around behavioral science and these sort of weird, quirky things that we all do and, you know, irrationally, but actually there is some rationale behind it. No, no, no, there is. Once you understand what the person is trying to do. Once you get it, yeah. The point is, we don’t always understand what we ourselves are trying to do. So it feels irrational, but there is rationality. Absolutely. So get hold of that book. And Rory, I guess that just leaves us to say thank you and have a lovely rest of your day. Absolutely.

University of South Australia provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage across various industries. From AI-generated art to chatbots in customer service, every sector is seemingly poised for disruption. It’s not just in your news feed every day – venture capital is pouring in, while CEOs are eager to declare their companies “AI-first”. But for those who remember the lofty promises of other technologies that have since faded from memory, there’s an uncanny sense of déjà vu. In 2017, it was blockchain that promised to transform every industry. Companies added “blockchain” to their name and watched stock prices skyrocket, regardless of whether the technology was actually used, or how. Now, a similar trend is emerging with AI. What’s unfolding is not just a wave of innovation, but a textbook example of a tech hype cycle. We’ve been here many times before. The tech hype cycle, first defined by the research firm Gartner, describes how emerging technologies rise on a wave of inflated promises and expectations, crash into disillusionment and, eventually, find a more realistic and useful application. Recognising the signs of this cycle is crucial. It helps in distinguishing between genuine technological shifts and passing fads driven by speculative investment and good marketing. It can also mean the difference between making a good business decision and a very costly mistake. Meta, for example, invested more than US$40 billion into the metaverse idea while seemingly chasing their own manufactured tech hype, only to abandon it later. Read more: Why the metaverse isn't ready to be the future of work just yet In 2017, blockchain was everyone’s focus. Presented as a revolutionary technology, blockchain offered a decentralised way to record and verify transactions, unlike traditional systems that rely on central authorities or databases. US soft drinks company Long Island Iced Tea Corporation became Long Blockchain Corporation and saw its stock rise 400% overnight, despite having no blockchain product. Kodak launched a vague cryptocurrency called KodakCoin, sending its stock price soaring. These developments were less about innovation and more about speculation, chasing short-term gains driven by hype. Most blockchain projects never delivered real value. Companies rushed in, driven by fear of missing out and the promise of technological transformation. But the tech wasn’t ready, and the solutions it supposedly offered were often misaligned with real industry problems. Companies tried everything, from tracking pet food ingredients on blockchain, to launching loyalty programs with crypto tokens, often without clear benefits or better alternatives. In the end, about 90% of enterprise blockchain solutions failed by mid-2019. Fast-forward to 2023, and the same pattern started playing out with AI. Digital media company BuzzFeed saw its stock jump more than 100% after announcing it would use AI to generate quizzes and content. Financial services company Klarna replaced 700 workers with an AI chatbot, claiming it could handle millions of customer queries. The results were mostly negative. Klarna soon saw a decline in customer satisfaction and had to walk back its strategy, rehiring humans for customer support this year. BuzzFeed’s AI content push failed to save its struggling business, and its news division later shut down. Tech media company CNET published AI-generated articles riddled with errors, damaging its credibility. These are not isolated incidents. They’re signals that AI, like blockchain, was being over hyped. There are three main forces at play: inflated expectations, short-term view and flawed implementation. Tech companies, under pressure from investors and media narratives, overpromise what AI can do. Leaders pitch vague and utopian concepts of “transformation” without the infrastructure or planning to back them up. And many rush to implement, riding the hype wave. They are often hindered by a short-term view of what alignment with the new tech hype can do for their company, ignoring the potential downsides. They roll out untested systems, underestimate complexity or even the necessity, and hope that novelty alone will drive the return on investment. The result is often disappointment – not because the technology lacks potential, but because it’s applied too broadly, too soon, and with too little planning and oversight. Like blockchain, AI is a legitimate technological innovation with real, transformative potential. Often, these technologies simply need time to find the right application. While the initial blockchain hype has faded, the technology has found a practical niche in areas like “asset tokenization” within financial markets. This allows assets like real estate or company shares to be represented by digital tokens on the blockchain, enabling easier, faster and cheaper trading. The same pattern can be expected with generative AI. The current AI hype cycle appears to be tapering off, and the consequences of rushed or poorly thought-out implementations will likely become more visible in the coming years. However, this decline in hype doesn’t signal the end of generative AI’s relevance. Rather, it marks the beginning of a more grounded phase where the technology can find the most suitable applications. One of the clearest takeaways so far is that AI should be used to enhance human productivity, not replace it. From people pushing back against the use of AI to replace them, to AI making frequent and costly mistakes, human oversight paired with AI-enhanced productivity is increasingly seen as the most likely path forward. Recognising the patterns of tech hype is essential for making smarter decisions. Instead of rushing to adopt every new innovation based on inflated promises, a measured, problem-driven approach leads to more meaningful outcomes. Long-term success comes from thoughtful experimentation, implementation, and clear purpose, not from chasing trends or short-term gains. Hype should never dictate strategy; real value lies in solving real problems. Write an article and join a growing community of more than 205,500 academics and researchers from 5,226 institutions.

Title: 3 Key Tax Considerations For The $1,000 Trump Savings Accounts

ByNathan Goldman ByNathan Goldman, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 06: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) An important provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the House of Representatives is the creation of the Trump Accounts. According to a Forbes article, these savings accounts will be funded by the federal government and they will provide each baby born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, with $1,000 for investment. This benefit is a unique solution to some of the problems plaguing taxpayers who struggle to invest in their and their children’s future. The Milken Institute estimates that this $1,000 investment would grow to over $8,000 by the time the child reaches the age of 18, providing substantial financial support that can be used for education, starting a business, or property ownership. According to CNBC, business leaders like Michael Dell (Dell Technologies), Dara Khosrowshahi (Uber), and David Solomon (Goldman Sachs) have all pledged significant support for this proposal. Despite the benefits of receiving $1,000 from the federal government, the initial set of rules is complicated, and there are three crucial tax considerations based on the current drafting of this provision. Stock prices go up and down on a continuous basis. Investors do not pay taxes on those fluctuations. When investors dispose of their stock, they recognize a gain or loss on the difference between the purchase price and the sales price. However, if the stock is invested in a retirement fund (i.e., a 401k or IRA), then the gain is deferred until the money is withdrawn from the account. This allows the account to grow tax deferred. Tax deferral is a valuable financial tool since it allows taxpayers to pay current tax liabilities at a future date. Given that inflation typically hovers around a couple of percentage points, time value of money principles suggest that deferring tax liability to a future year can save the taxpayer significant amounts of money. This deferral also applied to the Trump Accounts. Taxpayers’ children will receive this $1,000, and the money will be invested and tax deferred. Once the child turns 18, the money can be withdrawn, and the person can pay taxes on the difference between the current value and the initial amount invested. Built into the rules is a complex treatment for how the gains will be taxed. According to the Tax Foundation, if the funds are withdrawn and used for school tuition, a first-time home purchase, or a small business expense, they will be subject to capital gains tax. In 2025, single taxpayers who earn less than $48,350 pay 0% capital gains tax. As a typical 18-year-old does not make above this amount, these individuals will tend not to face a tax liability if the funds are applied toward one of these qualified activities. However, if the funds are applied toward a non-qualified activity, the individual will pay taxes on the gains at an ordinary rate. Even among the lowest-earning taxpayers, they would face a 10% income tax rate on this income. Even though the program provides a universal and automatic benefit to taxpayers, according to CNN, it is regressive in nature. Being regressive means that due to some of the tax considerations, it has the potential to benefit higher-earning taxpayers relatively more than lower-earning taxpayers. This relative benefit that makes it regressive is twofold. First, higher-earning taxpayers have a larger tax benefit from these funds. For instance, consider a married taxpayer with $1 million in taxable income. If this taxpayer invests $1,000 for their child when born, the high-earning taxpayer would owe 37% tax on the growth in the fund (20% if the growth receives preferential capital gain treatment). Meanwhile, a married taxpayer with a taxable income of $75,000 would only face a 12% ordinary income tax rate and would not owe any taxes if the gain qualifies for the preferential capital treatment. Thus, the tax treatment for this program has a relatively larger benefit for the higher-income taxpayer. Second, while the federal government will provide $1,000 to all children born during the specified time period, the child can have these contributions of up to $5,000 per year. Even though nothing expressly prohibits families from contributing additional funds to their children’s account, this portion of the provision has a clearer benefit for higher-earning families, who are in a better position to provide the additional contributions. Put differently, this provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows taxpayers a vehicle to defer taxes, and this vehicle can be taken advantage of by higher-earning taxpayers generally more easily than lower-earning taxpayers.

Such as Diamond planning for bankruptcy six months before it happened, something lots of publishers might like to have known.

Among the most popular tech products of the last year, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is currently offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of last year -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green-tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. ZDNET senior editor Sabrina Ortiz in her Meta Ray-Bans. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, in 2024, the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: I tested the best AR and MR glasses: Here's how the Meta Ray-Bans stack up If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a solid deal as well at $170 ($79 off) right now. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Based on the 20% savings on offer, ZDNET's rating system gives this a 3/5 Editor's deal rating. However, I've bumped it up to a 4/5, as this is in line with the price cut we saw on the glasses during Cyber Week, typically the biggest sale of the year. These glasses also rarely go on sale, making this an even more enticing offer. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings.

Title: When Diversification Fails: This 11.3% Dividend Has A Huge Hidden Cost

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Business meeting, brainstorming sessions discuss analysis of investment growth graph and market ... More charts in financial reports and business investment strategy planning. The media is still obsessed with the “sell America” trade. That is, in a word, overblown. But there is something valuable here—especially for us income investors. Because even though the US has the world’s most diverse and dynamic economy, bar none, we do need to make sure we’re spreading at least some of our assets beyond a single country or asset class. For maximum safety (both for our portfolio value and our income streams) we also need exposure to alternative asset classes beyond US blue chips, such as global stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and corporate bonds. But here’s where a potential pitfall lies: Important as diversification is, we can not make the common blunder of letting it take over our investment decisions. That way lies “locked-in” ho-hum (or worse!) returns. I think it’s better to be a little overexposed to, say, the US (or one specific asset class) and book greater returns than to suffer through year after year of missed profits. Let’s unpack this more using three high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that show the right and wrong ways to diversify: The first two are US-focused but have completely different portfolios, with one holding blue-chip stocks and the other corporate bonds. Taken together, they’re a great example of diversification done right. And we are, of course, talking income here, so I’ve included a dividend target, as well. In all of the examples we’ll get to, we’re aiming for a $100,000 yearly income stream. With, say, a collection of CEFs yielding 7%—an easy-to-get yield with these funds—you can get that $100K in payouts with just $1.43 million invested. That’s less than a fifth of what you’d have to pile into the typical S&P 500 stock. For the most safety, though, we want to diversify so that when one asset class is down, another will pick up the slack. But again, we do not want to become so fixated on this that we let it drag down our overall returns. Let’s start off with what’s happened so far this year. The Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), a CEF that yields 7.3%, is about flat, including reinvested dividends as I write this. The fund holds all the stocks in the S&P 500, as the name says, and sells call options on its holdings—a low-risk way to support its dividend. Meantime, the 14.1%-yielding PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund (PDI), the biggest corporate-bond CEF out there, has returned 8.7% year to date. Stocks Bonds DIversification PDI (in purple above) is easily covering its payouts this year, so we have no worries there. But if SPXX (in orange) doesn’t recover, it would have to cut payouts or sell stocks—and eat into investors’ capital—to maintain them. But fortunately, SPXX has outearned its payouts, with an 8.2% annualized total return, based on the performance of its underlying portfolio, in the last decade. So there are no worries here, either, for long-term SPXX holders. This combo, in other words, is an example of effective diversification: The stock and bond picks are working in tandem to deliver a strong average return (better than stocks alone for this year)—and we’re getting a 10.7% average dividend, too. Not bad! Now let’s look at a fund that offers “one-click” diversification that sounds great—it may even tempt you to simply buy, call yourself “diversified” and call it a day. But that would be a mistake, since not all diversification is created equal. That would be another CEF called the Clough Global Opportunities Fund (GLO). It holds the bulk of its portfolio in the US but devotes a large slice to the rest of the world, as well. That differs from SPXX’s domestic focus and PDI’s US-dollar-centric investments in bonds and bond derivatives. GLO’s geographic diversification is clever, tilting toward US multinationals with foreign consumer bases while also including high-quality international firms like Airbus and ICICI Bank (IBN). Plus, the fund yields a generous 11.3% as I write this. That gets us our $100,000 income stream on just $884,000 invested. GLO Short Term Above we see GLO (in blue) nearly matching the top-flight run of our bond fund (PDI, in purple). So GLO’s global setup has been a big hit so far this year. That makes sense, as foreign markets have beaten those of the US. So, GLO is a clear winner for income and diversification, right? Well, not so fast. GLO Long Term While SPXX (in orange above) and PDI (in purple) have had strong gains over the last decade, GLO is up a paltry 3.2% annualized, much less than its current yield. To be fair, this performance isn’t entirely the fault of GLO’s management: The rest of the world has lagged SPXX and PDI in the last 10 years. But the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US ETF (VEU), in orange below, has nearly doubled GLO. (VEU is a good benchmark for global stocks.) GLO Underperforms As you can see, GLO (in purple) was a big winner during COVID and after, but in the end couldn’t hold off VEU (in orange). This is why GLO is better avoided, even though it might seem like a good idea in the name of diversification. The bottom line is that when we diversify, we of course want to set ourselves up for long-term price gains and strong yields. Pairing top-quality stock and bond funds like PDI and SPXX can deliver these. But we do not want stocks or funds that will lag others (and particularly their own benchmarks) by wider and wider margins. That’s why I see GLO as a sell.

June 10, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: How a little-known tax change sparked a tech layoff surge
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/108230-how-little-known-tax-change-sparked-tech-layoff.html
Time Published: 2025-06-10T12:03:00Z
Full Content:
The big picture: A subtle but far-reaching shift in US tax law has upended the financial foundation of the technology industry, accelerating a wave of layoffs and reshaping how companies approach innovation. While headlines have pointed to over-hiring, economic volatility, and the rise of artificial intelligence as causes for the mass job losses in tech, a less visible factor has quietly played a pivotal role: a change to Section 174 of the tax code that dramatically altered how research and development costs are treated. For nearly seventy years, US companies could immediately deduct the full cost of their research and development activities, from engineering salaries to software development and contractor fees. This policy, rooted in Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code since 1954, encouraged businesses to invest in innovation and keep R&D operations within the United States. The approach fostered the growth of iconic tech giants and allowed startups and established firms alike to take risks, experiment, and expand rapidly. That landscape changed in 2022, when a provision from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had been delayed, took effect. To offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate, lawmakers required that R&D expenses be spread out, or amortized, over five years for domestic activities and fifteen years for foreign ones, rather than being deducted all at once. This adjustment, designed as a political maneuver to make the tax bill appear fiscally balanced, was largely unknown outside tax and accounting circles until its real-world consequences became impossible to ignore. The impact was immediate and severe. When companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules, they found themselves unable to offset their R&D spending against taxable income fully. For cash-strapped firms and those not yet profitable, the result was a sudden and painful increase in tax bills, just as venture funding was drying up and borrowing costs were rising. The financial pressure forced companies to make tough decisions, and in many cases, the largest and most flexible expense – headcount – was the first to be reduced. Since the start of 2023, the tech industry has shed more than half a million jobs, with some of the biggest names in the industry making substantial cuts. Meta reduced its workforce by nearly a quarter, Microsoft trimmed about 7 percent, and Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce all eliminated thousands of positions, often in product development and engineering – the very teams most affected by the loss of immediate R&D deductions. Smaller firms, lacking the financial cushion of industry giants, faced even harsher realities. Twilio, Shopify, and Coinbase each slashed significant portions of their staff, with reductions of 22 percent, nearly 30 percent, and 36 percent, respectively, over the past two years. R&D operations were particularly hard hit. The effects have not been limited to traditional tech companies. Throughout the 2010s, a wide array of businesses, ranging from retail to logistics and healthcare, relied on the same tax treatment to justify significant investments in software, data analytics, and internal tools. The Section 174 change disrupted this model, pushing many companies from a position of taxable loss to taxable income, even when their actual cash flow had not improved. As a result, the layoffs and cutbacks have rippled through the broader digital economy, which, together with core tech, accounts for about 20 percent of US GDP. The magnitude of the layoffs has been strikingly disproportionate compared to other sectors. While most industries saw job cuts in the low single digits, tech experienced a 60 percent surge in layoffs between 2022 and 2023, with entire divisions – especially in R&D – vanishing almost overnight. The consequences extend beyond the companies themselves, affecting local economies and service industries that rely on high-paid tech workers to sustain demand for everything from housing to restaurants and transportation. As Congress debates whether to reverse the Section 174 change, the politics remain complex. Restoring the old rules would reduce tax revenue and could be seen as favoring large corporations, even as the broader economic fallout continues. For many workers and communities already affected, any relief may come too late.

Title: Now Diamond's New Owner Ad Populum Sues Alliance Entertainment (AENT)

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond Diamond Comic Distributors' new owner Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop is suing Alliance Entertainment (AENT) over trade secrets and staff hiring Ad Populum, under their subsidiary company Sparkle Pop, the new owners of Diamond Comic Distributors, have launched a lawsuit against Alliance Entertainment or AENT. The suit alleges that AENT stole trade secrets from Diamond and poached employees during Diamond's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. This comes after AENT made a winning, if challenged and court-confirmed, bid for Diamond, only to then withdraw their offer, leaving Ad Populum and Universal Distribution as joint back-up winners. Then AENT sued Diamond Comic Distributors, alleging fraud over the bankruptcy auction and sale. And subsequently, AENT hired seven senior former employees of Diamond. Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop accuses Alliance Entertainment/AENT of "brazen disregard of binding non-disclosure and non-solicitation obligations and its theft of valuable trade secrets". That they "abused the bankruptcy process to gain inside access to Diamond Comics employees, trade secrets, and proprietary information, all while delaying the sale of assets to legitimate purchasers." And that "when Sparkle Pop finally closed the sale of Diamond Comics, Alliance pulled the rug out from under both seller and buyer, engaging in a sudden and coordinated raid to poach seven key Diamond Comics sales and marketing employees, effectively hobbling the business. Alliance also exploited its inside knowledge of Diamond Comics' confidential information to usurp key distribution relationships with vendors and customers, further undermining the business." According to the complaint, Alliance signed a non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreement (NDA) in October 2024 to access Diamond Comics' confidential information, including customer lists, vendor relationships, and financial data, as part of the bidding process. This also reveals that the Diamond Comic Distributors bankruptcy process began a lot earlier than had previously been thought, and something that will be of interest to comics publishers and other suppliers who were providing product to Diamond at that time, without that knowledge, until early January 2025. Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop states "Alliance has violated these strictures openly, effectively daring its counterparties and victims to sue if they want any hope of redress. This lawsuit responds to that challenge." The lawsuit claims that Alliance, after initially winning the auction in March 2025, refused to close the deal on "spurious grounds" just one day before the scheduled closing date. This allowed Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop and Universal Distribution to step in, closing the deal on the 15th of May. However, Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop alleges that Alliance exploited its access to Diamond Comics' confidential information to orchestrate a "coordinated raid" on the company's workforce and business relationships. The complaint details how, on the 16th of May, Diamond Comics' head of sales, Mike Schimmel, abruptly resigned, followed by six other key sales and purchasing employees a week later. Bleeding Cool identified them as; These employees, who the suit says had access to critical trade secrets, were allegedly hired by Alliance in violation of the NDA, which prohibited soliciting or hiring Diamond Comic employees until October 2026. Sparkle Pop further claims that Alliance used the confidential information to target Diamond Comics' Amazon distribution channel. According to the Sparkle Pop complaint, one former Diamond employee, Joe Lunday, reportedly urged Amazon to shift its business to Alliance. The lawsuit accuses Alliance of violating the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Maryland Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as well as tortiously interfering with employment contracts and the bankruptcy proceedings. Sparkle Pop is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, statutory double damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief to prevent Alliance from employing the allegedly poached workers, using Diamond Comics trade secrets, or soliciting its business partners, including Amazon. A cease-and-desist letter sent by Diamond Comics' counsel to Alliance on the 2nd of June reportedly went unanswered. Alliance Entertainment, based in Florida, has not yet responded to the lawsuit. It may also be notable that on the infamous Beyond Wednesdays podcast that AENT CEO Bruce Ogilvie appeared on, he stated that he had to reach out to the Raymond James firm, which was running the bankruptcy, and tried to buy Diamond before entering Chapter 11. The court case states that Raymond James reached out to AENT, and they signed the NDA in October, three months before entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It might be worth Bleeding Cool revisiting the timeline for the whole Chapter 11 affair. You can use these Diamond, AENT, and Ad Populum tags to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool.

Last month, Amazon fired 100 people working in its devices and services unit, the group overseeing development of such diverse products as the Kindle, Echo speakers, Alexa voice assistant and Zoox self-driving cars. A couple of days ago Amazon had another round layoffs, which included fewer than 100 people from the Goodreads social book discovery website and the Kindle division. CEO Andy Jassy is undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by reducing the number of managers. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our business roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles within the Books organization,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reminded staff that developing enormous teams and personal fiefdoms is not the way to success at the company, emphasizing that the online retail giant rewards those who accomplish more with fewer resources. Rather than mass layoffs, Amazon accomplished this goal by consolidating teams and reassigning some supervisors to individual contributor positions. via Reuters Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years.

June 09, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ: DNUT) Class Period: February 25, 2025 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 15, 2025 Krispy Kreme, together with its subsidiaries, produces doughnuts. On October 26, 2022, Krispy Kreme commenced a small-scale test to offer doughnuts at McDonald's Corporation restaurants in Louisville, Kentucky and the surrounding area and on March 26, 2024, Krispy Kreme and McDonald's announced they would expand their partnership nationwide beginning in the second half of 2024, the complaint alleges. The Krispy Kreme class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Krispy Kreme products declined materially at McDonald's locations after the initial marketing launch; (ii) demand at McDonald's locations was a driver of declining average sales per door per week; (iii) the partnership with McDonald's was not profitable; (iv) the foregoing posed a substantial risk to maintaining the partnership with McDonald's; and (v) as a result, Krispy Kreme would pause expansion into new McDonald's locations. The Krispy Kreme class action lawsuit further alleges that on May 8, 2025, Krispy Kreme released its first quarter 2025 financial results, reporting its "[n]et revenue was $375.2 million . . . a decline of 15.3%" and a "[n]et [l]oss [of] $33.4 million, compared to prior year net loss of $6.7 million." Additionally, Krispy Kreme announced that it is "reassessing [its] deployment schedule together with McDonald's" and "withdrawing its prior full year outlook and not updating it" due in part to "uncertainty around the McDonald's deployment schedule," the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of Krispy Kreme shares fell by nearly 25%, the Krispy Kreme class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the Krispy Kreme class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DNUT Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) Class Period: May 9, 2024 - May 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 14, 2025 According to the complaint, throughout the class period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Iovance's growth potential; notably, that it was not equipped to generate and drive demand or was otherwise ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported existing demand for its treatments through its network of approved treatment centers. On July 25, 2024, Iovance announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and reduced its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2024. The Company attributed its results and lowered guidance on 1) "the iCTC completed annual scheduled maintenance in December" and "capacity was reduced by more than half for about 1 month," 2) "[l]ower Proleukin sales" than the company expected, and 3) "the variable pace at which ATCs began treatment patients." Following this news, the price of Iovance's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $3.17 per share on May 8, 2025, Iovance's stock price fell to $1.75 per share on May 9, 2025, a decline of about 44.795% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Moguls Take Aim at Zaslav’s Vision of WBD as Company Splits: ‘It Was a Failure’
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/david-zaslav-wbd-split-hollywood-reaction/
Time Published: 2025-06-10T00:21:55Z

Said one top executive: “It’s a deal that never had a shot and shouldn’t have been done. But they’ve also done a terrible job running the company” In the narrow hallways where media moguls trade in brutal trash talk, David Zaslav’s move to split Warner Bros. Discovery into two companies — studio and streaming on one side and Turner-Discovery cable channels on the other — is being judged particularly harshly. Sure, say Zaslav’s peers, decoupling the streaming and content-producing side from the declining linear world makes sense now. NBCUniversal just did the same, spinning off its cable channels into a new entity, Versant. Lionsgate has just separated streamer Starz from its studio. But Zaslav only arrived in Hollywood a hot minute ago, bringing a vision of creating a 21st-century Hollywood studio with barely enough time to buy the Beverly Hills digs of producer Robert Evans, get a convertible Rolls-Royce and hang out at the Polo Lounge. What was the point, after all, of combining Warner Bros. with Discovery in order to create streaming scale to compete with Netflix and Disney+ in 2022, if only to unwind the whole thing three years later with a 60% drop in the Warner share price? “This whole thing was a waste of time,” said one openly-disgusted media executive, one of several who spoke to WaxWord. “They lost tremendous shareholder value. It was a failure.” This executive added: “It’s a deal that never had a shot and shouldn’t have been done. But they’ve also done a terrible job running the company.” “The cable bundle has been rotting the business for the past eight years,” said another top media executive, who also declined to be named. “For him [Zaslav] and [shareholder John] Malone — as much Malone as Zaslav — they were trying to exit Discovery.” And doing so bought more time, at the expense of WBD employees, who have already experienced several rounds of layoffs and face heightened uncertainty now. Spinning out the cable channels “is a huge problem off his plate. It gives it to Gunnar [Wiedenfels, WBD’s CFO],” said yet a third top media executive. “Everyone is doing it — Lionsgate, Comcast, now Warner Bros. and the last person who’ll figure it out is [Disney CEO] Bob Iger.” Doing the AT&T deal in 2022 may not have helped Warner, but it helped Zaslav. “He’s still at the table. If he hadn’t done the deal, he’d own Scripps and Discovery, and those things are the great disappearing act,” said this executive. “So he paid way too much, but he’s still at the table. In the end, for him, it was great. For the shareholders, it’s a disaster.” The overpayment is what has made Zaslav’s challenge particularly daunting, saddling the company with a stunning amount of debt that is now down to $37 billion for a company with a $26 billion market cap. The spinoff will require another $17.5 billion loan. But Warner executives, not surprisingly, see it differently. In his call with analysts on Monday, Zaslav observed that he’d grown the Max streaming service – despite renaming it three different times – to a global content force. “When we formed WBD, HBO Max was largely a domestic streaming service that lacked scale, basic technological proficiencies and a differentiated content strategy, as well as losing more than $2 billion,” he said. “We remain on track to surpass 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026 and to deliver at least $1.3 billion in Adjusted EBITDA this year.” The company reported 122 million streaming subscribers in Q1, including 57 million domestically. But Zaslav’s missteps have been well documented: renaming HBO Max to Max (they’ve reverted); betting that HBO Max and Discovery+ subscribers would cross over and enjoy each other’s content (they didn’t); figuring that no one would really care if he shelved a couple of completed movies (the creative community had a new Big Bad at the studios). And one former HBO executive reflected the concern among those who toiled at the premium network: “It is another (sad) attempt to salvage a sinking ship,” said this individual. “I have spoken with a few of my former surviving colleagues from the ‘glory’ days and they are quite concerned that this is another nothing-burger that gets press and does not move the needle as a long-term strategy. They are concerned about cuts and the devaluation of their work.” But perhaps the most salient outcome of the split announced on Monday is the likelihood that both Warner Bros. and the Turner cable properties will become targets for M&A, as each becomes small enough to attract an acquirer once the split happens next year. “Anyone who thinks that Warner-HBO thing is going to continue as an independent company is missing what’s going on here,” said the second executive. “That thing is extremely attractive. It’s small enough in net value for any of those [streamers] – Netflix, Amazon, Disney – to buy it. Which they will.” The third executive agreed. “This is just setting everyone up for the next M&A dance,” he said. “We know these things trade for 12-15x EBITDA, and they get sold 15-30x. That’s what Amazon paid for MGM. But none of that is going to happen when you’re dragging along a dead body. How do you get ‘Weekend at Bernie’s’ and cut the dead corpse loose?” This executive argued that ultimately Disney will need to do the same with its linear properties, including ABC and ESPN. Merging Warner with Discovery “was a huge miscalculation, but was it any more a miscalculation than Iger made in buying Fox? He spent $71 billion for a bunch of cable assets. Both these guys thought they were buying a studio with a bunch of IP and linear was coming along. But it turned out the linear fell off a cliff.” Warner vehemently disputed that its version of SpinCo would be a “dead body,” and said that Wiedenfels was committed to investing further. “There is a misperception that our Global Networks is the same bad bank as Versant is,” said a Warner executive. “It’s definitively different and set up to have a chance to do well, stretch its wings, see what it can do. It’s global. It has digital assets. We didn’t cleave off a favorite network like Bravo – they’re all going. And it will have up to a 20% stake in the streaming and studios.” The first executive strongly disagreed, arguing that CNN faces a particularly dire future. “It’s a really bad day for CNN. The two biggest brands on that side of the equation are TNT and CNN. [TNT] now goes forward without the NBA. And CNN has been incredibly diminished.” Historians will argue over whether the pivotal moment for a glorious legacy brand like Warner Bros. was the $85 billion sale to AT&T in 2018. It took only three years for AT&T to then pivot and spin out that asset in the merger with Discovery led by Zaslav. All three top executives said that move merely staved off the inevitable outcome on Monday, resulting from the linear decline that most Hollywood legacy studios failed to predict. “All of them together missed the one fact, which is obvious here: The white walkers were coming,” said the second executive. “The fact that you’re following the Starks, the Lanisters, whoever – who cares? That was all going to happen.” WBD stock closed down 29 cents on Monday, to $9.53. Lucas Manfredi contributed to this article.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Edison International Stock Falls as Analysts Cites Liability Risk

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at the onset of a new week as trade talks between the U.S. and China got underway in London, pointing to a potential thaw in the icy relationship between the world's two largest economies. The S&P 500 ticked 0.1% higher, while the Nasdaq added 0.3%. The Dow was essentially flat for the day, ending Monday's session just a single point below Friday's closing level. Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (ENPH) jumped 5.1%, securing the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Monday's gains extended a rally for the stock that began on Friday following reports of possible roadblocks in the Senate for the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," which includes proposals to eliminate solar tax credits that benefit Enphase and other manufacturers. Despite their recovery over the past two trading days, Enphase shares are still down more than 35% year-to-date. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) shares advanced 4.9% after a positive clinical trial readout for Dupixent, a skin treatment developed by the biotech firm in collaboration with Sanofi (SNY). A Phase 4 study showed that Dupixent improved disease severity and symptoms for adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Semiconductor stocks moved higher, boosted by optimism that progress on trade talks between the U.S. and China could result in softer export restrictions. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares gained 4.8% after Citi analysts lifted their price target on the stock ahead of the company's artificial intelligence (AI) showcase scheduled for later this week. Shares of ON Semiconductor (ON) closed 4.4% higher, adding to strong gains posted last week as the chipmaker's CEO highlighted a recovery in automotive and industrial demand. Edison International (EIX) shares plunged 8.1%, losing the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Monday, after Wolfe Research downgraded the California-based power generator's stock to "peer perform" from "outperform." Analysts cited legal proceedings related to this year's devastating wildfires in Southern California and legislation that could expose utilities in the state to increased wildfire liability costs. Shares of fellow Golden State electricity provider PG&E (PCG) sank 6.8%. The chief financial officer (CFO) of hospital operator Universal Health Services (UHS) told an industry conference that the company has seen a slowdown in the volume of care people are seeking. According to the executive, demand for voluntary procedures surged in the wake of the pandemic as patients caught up on care they may have delayed, but has cooled off since then and remains below historical averages. UHS shares were down 6.1%. Deutsche Bank downgraded Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) stock to "sell" from "hold" on Monday, and shares of the medical device maker slid 5.6%. While analysts highlighted the widespread adoption of the company's da Vinci robotic surgery system, Deutsche Bank cited risk to Intuitive's business from third-party companies repairing the manufacturer's older surgical instruments and returning them to service, cutting into sales of newer equipment.

Traders' bullishness around the public sale has led some to believe that the initial coin offering trend is back. ICOs were all the rage in 2017, but fizzled out due to a string of failed projects and growing regulatory scrutiny. In its documentation, Plasma is described as a Bitcoin sidechain that will use the network as a settlement layer as it attempts to “meet the unique needs of stablecoins.” The public sale will auction off 10% of the supply of XPL via deposits into an Ethereum vault through the recently debuted Sonar token sale platform. While the sale generated $500 million worth of interest, a Plasma team member clarified on X that only $50 million worth of XPL tokens will actually be sold. By holding funds in the deposit vault, users earn the option to purchase a share of tokens in the future sale, but are not obligated to do so—and they can withdraw their funds at any time. They'll also earn yield on their deposited tokens in the meantime. The Plasma XPL token sale just raised $500M in 5 minutes That’s 10x oversubscribed. One guy spent $100K on gas, just to get in. pic.twitter.com/hu46OcDdCv — Arkham (@arkham) June 9, 2025 Stablecoins have become a central focus in crypto lately. The tokens, typically pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar or other traditional assets, underpin the crypto industry, allowing traders to enter and exit trades with ease. Stablecoins don't offer the potential allure of massive gains like other cryptocurrencies, but they're an essential piece of the crypto market. The United States Senate is attempting to pass a bill that would establish a framework for legally issuing stablecoins in the States, dubbed the GENIUS Act. Meanwhile, Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization according to CoinGecko, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange last Thursday, in a roaring success. CRCL soared to another new peak price Monday, more than quadrupling the initial offering price. This whirlwind of excitement around stablecoins may explain why Plasma’s pre-sale vault filled up so quickly, as a project building a stablecoin-specific blockchain. One trader was so keen to get involved that they paid 39.15 ETH (just over $100,000) to ensure their deposit of $10 million in USDC was executed before the vault filled up. The extra $100,000 came in what is called a priority fee, which is an optional feature that allows users to pay as much as they want to incentivize validators to process their transaction quicker. This is particularly effective when the network is congested, as it may have been this time with a crowd of people attempting to enter the public sale all at once. When traders anticipate that others may be upping their priority fees, a gas war breaks out, resulting in huge bills not seen during the normal course of transacting. This behavior was present during the initial coin offering buzz of 2017 and the NFT boom of 2021-22, but more recently, meme coin traders have deployed the same strategy to "snipe" in-demand tokens. In the Plasma situation, however, the trader may have overshot the mark with their $100,000 priority fee. Out of the top five depositors, according to Etherscan, the highest fee paid was 4.49 ETH (over $11,500). Plasma raises $500M in literal seconds for something that nobody seems to be able to describe in detail. This tells me that we’re back speedrunning 2017 x 2021. This is the crypto supercycle we all dreamed about. The bubble of all bubbles is about to inflate. And I’m here for it. — Beanie (@beaniemaxi) June 9, 2025 “Plasma instant cap fill today is a gigantic beacon signaling meta shift,” pseudonymous trader IcoBeast wrote on X. “ICOs are officially back, and Sonar is likely the most impactful crypto-native release of 2025 for the direction of crypto.” ICOs soared in 2017 with countless projects raising capital by selling crypto tokens, including prominent projects like Filecoin and Tezos. Within a year, Bitcoin.com found, 46% of projects failed before or after raising funding. Victor Teixeira, fund principal at investment firm Contango Digital Assets, believes that the hysteria experienced during the 2017 ICO craze has been here the whole time—it’s just been in meme coins. “The meme coin market we experienced in the last year is the same confluence of hype and retail adoption that we saw in the 2017 ICO boom,” Teixeira told Decrypt. “What I think we're seeing is that even though TRUMP and other meme coins onboarded a lot of investors into Web3, unless you got into these projects within the first two to three hours, you lost money.” “Retail still wants to take a punt on the 1000x play, and if you can capture that demand and tie it to an actual product, you have a much stronger story to tell, with actual potential to hit the upside,” he added. “In this last cycle, we just didn't have a real project that could grab that imagination and excitement as well as meme coins could." But not everyone is happy with the Plasma ICO, due to the top 10 participants filling 40% of the available deposit supply—a sign that so-called crypto whales dominated the sale. A total of 1,108 wallets were able to participate in the vault deposit campaign—that’s an average of over $450,000 each. That said, according to Etherscan, 141 traders contributed less than $1,000 apiece. No date has been set for the actual token sale, though as traders have suggested, the impact of Monday's surging demand may be felt broadly across the market if other projects sense there's untapped demand for a new wave of ICOs.

Title: Massive Tech Layoffs May Be the Fault of a 2017 Trump Tax Cut

The good times in Silicon Valley are overâat least as far as the current generation of coders is concerned. The software industry is shrinking and, since 2023, the tech industry has been hemorrhaging jobs at an astounding rate. Workers who would’ve been secure several years ago are now out on their asses. While the reasons for this are diverse (AI is often discussed as a potential culprit and the overall economy has had its ups and downs over the past several years), one potential driver could also be the tax cuts that Trump passed in 2017. It turns out that a little-known provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 altered a longstanding loophole, known as Section 174, that allowed the tech industry to offload the cost of its research and development operations onto the federal government. Prior to the TCJA, tech companies could deduct 100 percent of the costs of R&D, allowing tech businesses the freedom to commit significant resources towards innovation. Bloomberg reports that, as Congress sought to find a way to offset the cost of giving big tax cuts to billionaires, one place where they discovered fat to trim was the tech industry’s R&D funding. 2017’s bill shifted the deduction from a full write-off to funding that would have to be parsed out over a period of several years. The provision that pared back the funding did not kick in until 2022, however. Not long after it went into effect, the tech industry began shedding jobs like nobody’s business. Indeed, 2023 and 2024 were historically bad years for the tech industry, with major companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google booting workers by the thousands. Quartz took a deeper look at the ties between this policy shift and the tech industry’s troubles and now speculates that there is a positive correlation: …the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision â buried deep in the 2017 tax law â has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. Thatâs the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a âniche issue with broad impact,â echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. Quartz also notes that the policy change would have translated into a loss of income for a variety of positions: The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff â all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one â now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. The reality of the government’s subsidization of Silicon Valley is particularly ironic given the rabid anti-government sentiment currently circulating in the industry. People like Marc Andreessen would have you believe that tech’s R&D can be funded through private money alone, despite no reputable track record of it happening. Elon Musk’s DOGE, meanwhile, recently attacked the very parts of the government that have been responsible for helping companies like his own (Tesla) flourish. It’s yet another sign that America’s billionaires are so greed-addled that they’re willing to shoot a gift horse in the mouth and call it victory. Not everybody in the tech industry is an idiot, however. There is currently a concerted effort to reestablish the government’s R&D subsidy. The American Innovation and R&D Competitiveness Act, which was introduced by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, would restore the full flow of federal dollars for tech’s development needs. Last month, representatives from major tech firms reportedly signaled to the Trump administration that they might pull back from previous pledges of U.S. investment if the full tax subsidy didn’t return. layoffs Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

More than 1,600 respondents reflected the chilling effect across research fields caused by the slashing of federal funding for universities and science agencies. Weather balloon operations will stop or be reduced at 11 locations across the country due to staffing shortages caused by recent NOAA layoffs. After mass layoffs at NOAA, meteorologist Andrew Hazelton finds himself in a bureaucratic no manâs landâfired, then reinstated, but still unable to work. Managers have hit walls trying to rehire former employees due to mysterious and unexplained blocks on their profiles. About 10% of the NOAA workforce was laid off, according to some reports, in a move that could kneecap the agency's ability to forecast local and national weather events.

Title: Best meal delivery services and kits, tested and approved for the whole family

Is dinner time a daily struggle? If you have more than a few mouths to feed, it sure can feel that way. As a toddler-mom, I know the challenge all too well. If half my daughter’s food doesn’t end up splattered across the floor, I consider that a win. A big win. Sometimes, that simply means resorting to pizza delivery. Other days, it means digging through the pantry until I find something I purchased in 2018. Neither feels like the solution I’m looking for. Suffice it to say, family meal kits have turned into our saving grace. Everyone has their own taste, and if there are kiddos involved, half the battle is searching for a recipe that will appease those uber-picky eaters. Lucky for you and your little ones, most family-friendly meal kits offer a rotating menu curated across a variety of diets and preferences, from crowd-pleasing comfort foods to keto-friendly options for health-conscious households. There are even some gourmet plans to try for the families wishing to brush up on their chef skills. To guide your search for easier meals (and more sanity), we’ve spent hours researching, ordering, cooking, and taste-tasting some of the best meal kits for families on the market. We considered top-rated delivery services, from Factor to HelloFresh, as well as dedicated kids’ options like Little Spoon, too. Whether you’re looking for the best made-from-scratch meals, microwave-ready options, or a subscription service that will save you time and a few bucks, this roundup has got something for you. Behold, the best meal delivery service for families, delivered right to your doorstep. Pros: Cons: A family meal kit roundup is not complete without HelloFresh. The company is one of the first brands to enter the meal-subscription service, and today, they go by the simple motto: Eat Well. Feel Good. Save Time. Our editors have tested HelloFresh many times since it opened in 2012, and this time around, we decided to look into their family-friendly meal kits. For a free high-protein item for life and 10 free meals, use code “NYP10FMFS“. New York Post Review: HelloFresh has managed to maintain a stellar reputation for years, so I was curious to see just how seamless the service was. Spoiler: I was sold in the first five minutes. My daughter and I aren’t afraid of some flavor (and spice), and it wasn’t hard to find meals that could satisfy both cravings on its menu. We ordered the Coconut Curry Chicken, Apricot, Almond & Chickpea Tagine, Coconut Curry Tofu with Bok Choy, and Sweet Sesame Udon with Chicken & Red Peppers. My order arrived right on time for its scheduled Wednesday delivery, dropped right on my doorstep. The box was stacked with ice packs, and each meal was neatly packed into a brown paper bag with proteins stored on ice below. The recipe pages were placed on top, with images and easy step-by-step directions so even amateur home-chefs can follow along. Overall, I was very impressed. Everything was neat, aesthetic, and my favorite part, easy to get rid of. The expected preparation time for my home-cooked meals was around 25 minutes, but we clocked out in about 20. I’m an avid believer that your toddler doesn’t need to eat separately from the adults, and I found that HelloFresh had options that were enjoyable for all parties. Finetuning the recipes is easy. For my daughter, I cut the serving size in half and used the spice packets a bit more sparingly. I was pleasantly surprised by how filling everything was. HelloFresh isn’t pretending to be gourmet, but the meals were appetizing and on the heartier side. Some leftover can be expected. HelloFresh offers a variety of plans suited to different needs. Simply select the number of meals needed per week and the number of mouths to feed (up to six people). From there, you can select preferences — meals in under 20 minutes, protein-packed varieties, and the easiest family-friendly options. HelloFresh generates a menu that works well for you, and you won’t have a hard time finding something everyone can agree on. Pros: Cons: Little Spoon is a pioneer in the kids’ meal kit space, setting a new standard with its diverse menu for picky eaters and their health-conscious parents. Many recipes are certified organic, developed by experts, and packed with real ingredients that little ones love (heavy on the fruits, veggies, and whole grains). In 2024, Little Spoon became the first U.S. baby food brand to adopt EU-aligned safety standards for its Babyblends. New York Post Review: To be completely candid, it’s pretty slim pickings when it comes to kids’ food delivery services. When I heard about Little Spoon, I knew I needed to give it a shot. These beautifully packaged kids’ meals come in every shape, size, and flavor profile, so you can stock your fridge and forget about the rest. The subscription service is very straightforward. It’s also easy to filter for gluten-free, dairy-free, and nut-free items, so families with special diets or allergies should have no problem finding what they need. I settled on a mix of their best-sellers like Turkey Kale Meatballs, Rosemary Chicken, Spinach and Cheese Ravioli, Pizzalicious Veggie Loops, the Golden Apple Pie Smoothie, and more tasty snacks. The order arrived a few days after it was placed, in a durable box with all heat-and-eat meals completely frozen. Everything was clearly labeled and vacuum-sealed in BPA, BPS, and Phthalate-free packaging. The best part about this service is easily the fact that no preparation is necessary. For the frozen meals, you can simply pop them in the microwave. Snack bags and smoothies are also resealable, so you can take them on the go. My daughter greets each Little Spoon meal with delight; the portions are just right, textures are easy, and flavors are bursting. Half the time, she’s begging for more, which is quite the 180 from the finicky eater I used to know. I had to try a taste for myself to see what it was all about, and I can affirm — Little Spoon understands how to lock in freshness. I wouldn’t know better if you said they came right from a restaurant. Yes, this service is made for kids, but I’d be lying if I said I haven’t popped a meal in the microwave for myself, too. From hearty chef-curated Lunchers and Plates suited for every eating stage, to slurpable Smoothies, perfectly-portioned Biteables, and Puffs for school lunches and snacking. Little Spoon has a little bit of everything, making it a great choice for families with young children. All products are junk-free. Little Spoon maintains a list of over 100+ banned ingredients, so ingredients like artificial flavors, sweeteners, or certified synthetic colors are never in their products. Little Spoon offers a selection of meals tailored to different age groups, each with its own price range. The subscription service is simple. Following the first order, all future deliveries are scheduled to ship every two weeks. Customers can also skip, cancel, and edit menu plans at any time. Larger bundles offer the best meal discounts. A standard shipping fee of $10 is applied to all orders. Pros: Cons: Factor might be the best prepared meal delivery for families, especially if you’re factoring in calories while counting the clock. These meals require no prep and no cooking. The entire menu is dietitian-approved and chef-prepared, and all you’ll need to do is pop your plates into the microwave for two minutes and enjoy. The protein-heavy menu spans from seafood delicacies like Salmon Piccata to Fajita-Spiced Shrimp and Filet Mignon, as well as tasty plates like Blueberry Pancakes and Kale and Mushroom Egg Bites, so you could have breakfast, lunch, and dinner covered. Get up to $130 off and free shipping on your first box with promo code “NYP130FS“. Families barely have enough time to set the table, let alone prepare homemade meals. Factor is an attractive choice for those who would prefer heat-and-eat meals that can be stored in the fridge and freezer. This entirely pre-made delivery service also offers protein shakes, snacks, and fresh juices that are perfect for families looking to meet health goals. Simply order as many as you’ll need to feed the entire family. Pros: Cons: Feeding the whole family gets pricey. EveryPlate has positioned itself as a more budget-friendly meal delivery service, and they’ve made good on that promise. Meals start at around $5.99 per serving, making it more affordable than strong competitors like Blue Apron and even HelloFresh. The recipes are a bit simpler, as is the packaging, which helps keep prices lower for customers. To pay just $1.99 per meal on your first box, use code “NYP199EP“. New York Post Review: EveryPlate’s menu may have been absent of filets and fancy recipes I can’t pronounce, but I was still pleasantly surprised with the options. I ordered a sampling of the Hawaiian-Style Loco Moco, Saucy Black Bean Fajita Burrito Bowls, and Soy-Marinated Steak Fried Rice. Everything was delivered in a brightly-colored cardboard box that arrived ahead of schedule. Upon breaking it open, I noticed the ingredients were all placed together in one bag, with meat and fish placed below. This is a bit different than HelloFresh, which wraps meals separately, but it’s no bother as long as you save some time to sort through the ingredients. It took some time to find what I needed for the different recipes, but once that was out of the way, the rest of the preparation process was seamless. The meal cards have large photographs for those who are more visually oriented. I probably could have figured out how to make the black bean bowl from pictures alone, and for busy parents, that type of intuitive cooking is greatly appreciated. It saves time, energy, and takes out the guesswork. Another big draw: The recipes are simple, so simple in fact that my toddler was able to assist in stirring up some sauces. Sure, EveryPlate cuisine might not look like it came out of a Michelin-star restaurant (frankly, kids don’t care about that), but the meals were still tasty and just as good as leftovers the next day. My daughter devoured the Saucy Black Bean Fajita Burrito Bowls (pictured above) within minutes, and it’s typically a battle just to get her to try any type of veggie, let alone peppers, onions, and tomatoes in one dish. Since EveryPlate has a smaller menu to choose from, you may notice some repetition. However, families who value affordability, consistency, and practicality might appreciate having fewer choices — we sure did. EveryPlate caters to a more value-driven crowd, ideal for college students, first-time meal kit users, and families with young children. Meal plans range from two to six people, with three to five meals per week. The menu rotates with about 20 choices, and most meals are ready in 20 minutes or less. Customers can filter for family faves, quick and easy recipes, healthier options, and more suited for different diets. Pros: Cons: If you’re all about options, Blue Apron is hard to beat. The rotating menu features over 100 meals every week, which makes it easy for foodies to find something fresh and exciting every time they put in their order. It’s easy to filter for carb-conscious options, family favorites, seasonal veggie varieties, and more categories customized to your liking. There’s even a section dedicated just to desserts, so sweet-tooths are satisfied too. Blue Apron has also positioned itself as a more sustainable choice, as far as subscription services go. Their team partners with experts to create better standards for growing food and raising animals, committing to antibiotic and hormone-free meats and selecting seafood recommended by Seafood Watch, so customers know they’re meals are sustainably sourced and safe to eat. Blue Apron isn’t just a meal kit subscription, it’s designed to teach you how to cook new recipes you may have never tried before. This service is a great way to introduce kids to new flavors and spend quality time with each other in the kitchen. As far as meal plans go, customers can choose from over 20 weekly options of never frozen, microwave-ready meals in 1, 2, 3, or 4 serving sizes. You can stop or skip at any time and shop single-serve options from the Marketplace, no subscription required. Based on our testing and research, EveryPlate was the most cost-effective meal kit for large families. Meals average at roughly $5.99 per serving, with a shipping fee of $9.99 per order. However, the overall price-per-meal decreases with orders of larger quantities. For five meals that cater to six people a week, the total cost comes to just $1.99 per serving. First-time customers can also score a discount of up to 66% off the total cost of their order. To review the best family meal kits, we evaluated the meal delivery services on a few factors: taste, nutrition, convenience, variety, and overall value. Each factor played a key role in determining whether the service was worth the cost for parents. Looking for a headline-worthy haul? Keep shopping Post Wanted.

Title: Retail Investors Are Buying AI Stocks, But Not the Ones They Used To

The AI trade is back on after April's tariff rout, but retail investor purchases suggest it's taking a new shape. After a surge in dip buying following April's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement, "there's been a clear shift away from Mag 7+ names" into "second-derivative AI laggards and other higher-risk opportunities," according to a recent analysis of retail investor flows by Marco Iachini and Lucas Mantle at Vanda Research. Nvidia (NVDA), a favorite among retail investors over the last few years, saw large outflows starting in mid-May after shares jumped on easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Purchases of leveraged ETFs, which double or triple Nvidia's daily return, slumped to a 1-year low last month, "though options activity shows no signs of bearish positioning," according to Vanda. "We interpret this as classic profit-taking." Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are down since the start of the year, but nearly the entire group has sharply rebounded from early April's tariff panic. Retail investors who bought the dip are likely locking in profits from these "core portfolio holdings." While investors are pivoting from the Magnificent Seven, they're not abandoning the AI trade. Rather, investors are piling into smaller data center stocks like Applied Digital (APLD), Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS), and CoreWeave (CRWV), all of which are affiliated with Nvidia. Retail investor purchases of each increased by more than 150% over the past month. Mom-and-pop traders have also been big buyers of quantum computing stocks, a reflection of their substantial risk appetite. In the last week of May, retail investors bought more D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), with its $6 billion market cap, than they did UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a $275 billion company. In the time that investors bought a net $17 million of Meta (META) stock, they funneled $25 million into Rigetti Computing (RGTI). Iachini and Mantle note it's common for retail investors to venture into riskier corners of the market after a successful bout of dip-buying. But plenty of uncertainty about tariff policy and the economic outlook remain despite the market's recent rebound. Retail investors taking on more risk recently, "while not unusual, suggests a level of complacency that may be mismatched with still-lingering macro risks and thus adds to our sense that we are living in the final innings of the current equity rally," they wrote. The market's risk appetite was on full display Monday, with the small-cap Russell 2000 and tech-heavy Nasdaq leading U.S. stock indexes higher. Shares of Navitas Semiconductor were up nearly 25% in recent trading, while CoreWeave advanced 15%.

Title: Warner Bros. Discovery to be split, as Zaslav retreats from grand ambitions
URL: https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428176/warner-bros-discovery-split-hbo-max-zaslav
Time Published: 2025-06-09T17:20:59Z
Full Content:
David Folkenflik Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav, shown at a New York Times event in 2023, announced on Monday that the company would be split, with its streaming and Hollywood studios on one side, and its cable properties on the other. The company currently includes HBOMax, Warner Bros. movie and television studios, and CNN among its properties. Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption Warner Bros. Discovery chief executive and president David Zaslav yielded to the reality of the digital age and to the skepticism of Wall Street investors on Monday by announcing he would split the company into two: one focusing on streaming, the other on its cable networks. Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, which will include HBO Max and the Warner Bros. movie and television studios. The cable business, including CNN, TBS, TNT and Discovery, is to be run by the current corporation's chief financial officer, Gunnar Wiedenfels. "The cultural significance of this great company and the impactful stories it has brought to life for more than a century have touched countless people all over the world. It's a treasured legacy we will proudly continue in this next chapter of our celebrated history," Zaslav said in announcing the split. "By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape." Under Zaslav, the new digital company will seek to continue building subscribers in countries around the world for its own streaming service while creating content for its bigger competitors - Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime. The break-up represents a collapse of Zaslav's ambitions and aspirations for the mega-media company. Just three years, two months and one day ago, Zaslav completed the acquisition of Warner Media in a deal valued at $43 billion to create Warner Bros. Discovery. He said the combined company would have the scale and caliber of offerings to compete with digital streaming giants. It didn't. That deal required taking on more than $50 billion in debt. While a significant amount has been paid off, much remains. Warner Bros. Discovery's history since has been marked by a series of moves to pay down that debt, including the killing of CNN's nascent streaming service (which is just now being rebuilt), bids that failed to win renewal of NBA rights for Turner Sports, and layoffs at various properties. The company has lost nearly half its market valuation since the merger, though shares bounced up by nearly 10% in the hours after Monday's announcement. Zaslav had a compensation package valued at $52 million last year - making him one of the country's highest-paid corporate chieftains, according to a study published by Harvard Law School. (Shareholders voted against it in a symbolic vote.) The transaction is supposed to close by the middle of next year, though it is contingent on an assessment from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that it can proceed free of taxes. President Trump has made clear in his first few months back in office that he is willing to deploy what are supposed to be non-partisan levers of government for political and ideological aims. Most recently, Trump suggested he would seek to revoke governmental contracts with Tesla after a public falling out with its controlling owner, Elon Musk, who had previously served as his adviser on slashing federal budgets. In the case of Warner Bros. Discovery, Trump has repeatedly blasted CNN as unfair, partisan and "fake news." "These are two much smaller companies than the grand vision [Zaslav] anticipated when he bought the assets from AT&T," former CNN US president Jonathan Klein tells NPR. "The question is: now that they're small enough to be bought, who buys each of these units?" Comcast really underwent much the same transformation - splitting its broadcast, movie and broadband properties from its cable channels. Several former television executives asked whether the new parent for MSNBC and CNBC – named Versant – might be a natural buyer for Warner Bros. Discovery's cable channels. Or private equity investors intent on maximizing profits might decide to pick up Warner Bros. Discovery's cable networks, Versant - or both. In any of those scenarios, a new owner would almost certainly have to pick between retaining MSNBC or CNN. NPR financial correspondent Maria Aspan contributed to this story.

Michael Saylor-led Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, expanded its Bitcoin coffers with its most recent purchase. According to a Monday US Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing, Strategy scooped up 1,045 Bitcoin between June 2 and June 8 at an average price of $105,426 per coin. The Tysons, a Virginia-based firm, is the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, controlling 582,000 Bitcoin worth roughly $62.7 billion based on current prices. Strategy started accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020 with an initial purchase of 21,454 BTC for $250 million. It now owns the equivalent of 2.8% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. Bitcoin was changing hands at $107,687 at press time, up about 1.9% over the past 24 hours, according to crypto market data provider CoinGecko. Last month, the apex crypto climbed to an all-time high of $111,000 before giving up those gains. Strategy’s total cache was purchased at an average price of $70,086 per Bitcoin for a total cost of around $40.8 billion, including fees and expenses. Strategy’s most recent Bitcoin acquisition was financed with proceeds from at-the-market sales of its perpetual Strike preferred stock, STRK, and perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF. The company raised $66.4 million and $45.8 million by selling STRF and STRK, respectively. “Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor posited Friday on X, highlighting the Bitcoin Treasury company’s comparatively impressive performance compared to Tesla, Bitcoin, Meta, and gold, among other companies and assets over the past year. The company’s market capitalization stands at $102.3 billion, up from the $1.2 billion reported in July 2020 before kicking off its Bitcoin accumulation spree. Its success story has inspired a long list of other publicly traded companies to follow suit. With Trump Media and Gamestop recently joining the likes of Metaplanet (nicknamed “Japan’s MicroStrategy”) and Semler Scientific in adopting Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook and building their own BTC treasuries.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang got the rockstar treatment during London Tech Week — and even garnered some comparisons to Tony Stark The conference attendees waited in long lines before the conference opened to get a good seat for Huang’s event with the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Many people didn’t even manage to get into the talk. “He’s like Iron Man,” one conference goer told CNBC about Huang. “The amount of infrastructure required for AI wouldn’t be possible without that man.” The Nvidia (NVDA) co-founder and CEO called the U.K. “the envy of the world” in a “Goldilocks circumstance,” during his appearance. Huang also told the audience that Nvidia will continue to pour cash into Britain, which he called “such a great place to invest.” The company will start an AI lab there and wants to upskill the workforce. He said, “Because of AI, every industry in the U.K. will be a tech industry.” He added: “The U.K. has one of the richest AI communities anywhere on the planet, the deepest thinkers, the best universities…and the third largest AI capital investment of anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, Starmer emphasized the country’s “sovereign AI ambitions,” stating that the government will invest £1 billion in AI by 2030. Huang’s appearance in London kicked off his European tour. He plans to visit Paris this week, where he is likely to meet with French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron. Nvidia is also working with Germany to help them build a supercomputer using Nvidia architecture and with Sweden to construct the Scandinavian country’s first national AI infrastructure.

(“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company.

What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Title: Amazon confirms layoffs in books business

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. A move to streamline some roles affects fewer than 100 people and doesn’t reflect downsizing in the books organization, the company said. Amazon is laying off employees in its books business, affecting fewer than 100 people, the e-commerce giant confirmed by email Friday. Certain positions were consolidated to streamline operations, but the move doesn’t affect the overall size of the books organization, the company said. U.S. Q1 print book sales fell 1% year over year, in part due to Easter’s timing. Fiction sales grew, but nonfiction and children’s books fell, according to Circana’s Bookscan report. Amazon started off as a bookseller but the category hasn’t always been a winner for it. The dominance of Amazon’s Kindle device fuels its e-book sales and its Audible business fuels audiobooks sales, but print still accounts for about 80% of all book revenue, according to the Association of American Publishers. When it comes to print books, though, Amazon has ceded the physical landscape. In 2022, even as U.S. consumers enthusiastically returned to shopping in physical stores, Amazon announced it would shutter all of its brick-and-mortar bookstores. This isn’t necessarily a reflection of the business as a whole. The number of independent booksellers grew last year and is projected to expand again in 2025, according to the American Booksellers Association. And Barnes & Noble’s comeback continues apace, with another 60 store openings planned for this year. The layoffs at Amazon’s books business come mid-year, after cutting about 200 roles in its North America retail operations in January. In the past couple of years the company has more aggressively downsized teams related to its retail business, including tech teams at its physical stores. In 2023 the company laid off more than 18,000 people, many of them in retail. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our business roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles within the Books organization,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Gillman said Friday. “We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transitions.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Since December, retailers including Party City, The Container Store and Joann have all filed for Chapter 11.

If you’re interested in starting or starting back, check out the link in my bio to so many amazing Groupons! #GrouponPartner #GiftingWithGroupon #GrabLifeByTheGroupon Core to this short case is the unsustainable unit economics of these long tail telehealth and med spa providers offering GLP-1 services. Each of these providers competes with one another, driving prices down as they take a bath on offering the initial month, 6-week, 8-week introductory offer through Groupon. The only reason these providers are willing to offer such low margin, cheap deals is because they hope to convert enough of these introductory customers to recurring revenue streams over the coming months and years. While customers may get the first month for as low as $60-$80, most of these providers then enroll customers in $299, $399, $499, etc. monthly subscriptions. However, these Groupon customers are more customers of Groupon and less customers of a specific provider. This is a classic case of adverse selection which eventually leads to merchant churn. Given that so many providers are present on Groupon and given that it has been very publicly announced that the shortage is over and both 503A and 503B pharmacies offering compounded solutions would have to come to an end, consumers caught on in late 2024 into early 2025 that they can effectively just sign up for 1 trial with each provider on Groupon and stockpile doses from multiple providers rather than stick with a single provider. Obvious this is very reckless behavior and sampling 4-week, 6-week, 8-week trial offers from multiple brands is not ideal given that these medications come from different pharmacies with different add-ins, prescribed by different doctors. In the below TikTok video from November 2024, one user of Groupon GLP-1 medications lays out her behavior:"...I kept getting emails from Groupon that they have [GLP-1 treatments] for a lower price, and it's for one month only, so I'm just going to try it out and see, and there are different little companies that sell [GLP-1 treatments] on Groupon, like med spas pretty much, and if that works well for me I will be trying every single one of them." groupon GLP-1 is crazy 👀 #marriedsinglemom #changingmylife #glp1 #glp1forweightloss #tirzepatide #groupon Here's a price sensitive user posting on Reddit about shopping around on Groupon and trying out their third Groupon trial offer. This below Reddit user is also shopping around doing 1 of every trial offer on Groupon instead of sticking with 1 consistent provider. This below poster on Facebook spells the name of the medication incorrectly and promotes shopping around and doing this "1 of every trial offer on Groupon" behavior instead of sticking with a single stable provider. So the question then is: are Groupon vendors churning or about to churn? If these vendors are taking on too much risk or taking a bath on intro offers that do not turn into recurring revenue, is there evidence that they are no longer on the platform? It seems that after the April and May 2025 changes to compounded GLP-1 medications, there are serious cracks in Groupon's armor that have just developed. Crack in Armor #1: Major Groupon Player WeightCare Experiencing Issues This Past Month WeightCare has seen relatively stellar reviews...up until the past several weeks post April and May changes to FDA regulations. https://www.trustpilot.com/review/joinweightcare.com Crack in Armor #2: Entities with Groupon Specifically Named on Their Websites Are Churning and No Longer Have Active Offers on Groupon Wellyou.life is a related entity to Health Solution MD and they have pulled down their semaglutide and tirzepatide offers from Groupon. Below is telehealth entity called Weight Loss Injector which was made by a business called Cosmetics Injector that is located inside of a beauty salon in a shopping mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. They have recently pulled down their Groupon offer and seem unable to compete with larger operations on Groupon that are offering deals around $50-$60. Below is a completely insane landing page experience from a med spa called Absolut Beauti (dot org?) in the Atlanta area, showing that this business clearly relies heavily on Groupon for weight loss customers. Absolut Beauti Bar actively advertises on Groupon for Botox and other filler products, yet appears to have now abandoned their Groupon efforts around GLP-1, which they have advertised since June 2024 a year ago. https://www.instagram.com/absolut_beauti/reel/C8hTzwbO0g2/ and https://www.groupon.com/deals/absolut-beauti-bar-9 While Groupon has historically had various software license and product key offerings of varying quality over the years, it is clear that current management has actively pushed Microsoft Office to align with Microsoft's October 1, 2024 release of Office 2024. Included in these efforts is a push in USA Today in March 2025 and paid sponsorship and priority placement on Google Search. Groupon's prior management team did not prioritize Microsoft Office-related efforts. The current management team's efforts show a clear spike in Q4 2024 through Q1 2025 centered around Microsoft's Office 2024 new version release, though this trend appears to have begun to tail off in Q2 2025. Additionally, there has been an uptick in reported scams and questionable product keys across social media and Microsoft forums related to Groupon's investment in pushing Microsoft Office 2024 sales such as this post about Groupon partner License Tom from February 2025 or this other post about License Tom from December 2024 or the many other posts across internet forums where Groupon customers report having issues with Office bought through Groupon. Given that Microsoft Office 2024 was only first available to consumers from October 1, 2024 onward and given that Groupon posts their unit sales increments, we can proxy a floor for billings contribution from Microsoft Office 2024 and especially contribution to the North America Local billings. Below are the current Microsoft Office 2024 offers listed on Groupon's website as of June 8, 2025. I note that these estimates are: a) simply a floor, and the real billings numbers are likely much higher given that the unit sales are presented as round numbers (eg. 10,000+, 25,000+, etc.) b) only reflective of the deals currently on the site as of June 6-8, 2025, and that many vendors come and go and are not currently displayed on Groupon c) only reflective of the recent Microsoft Office 2024 offerings, although the increased traffic driven from this Microsoft release certainly translated to sales on Office 2021 and other versions, which became even more discounted 25,000 units * $26 = $650,000 5,000 units * $99.99 = $500,000 500 units * $159.99 = $80,000 Note: this offer contains links that redirect to a site - techlogit.com - that seems to exclusively use Groupon. 5,000 units * $34.99 = $175,000 910 units * $34.99 = $31,850 10,000 units * $39.99 = $400,000 25,000 units * $39.99 = $1,000,000 10,000 units * $34.90 = $349,000 There are also a number of other offers advertising Microsoft Office 2024 post-October 1, 2024 that do not actually offer Microsoft Office 2024, only earlier versions of Office. One example is below: 1,000 units * $49.99 = $50,000 5,000 units * $79.99 = $400,00060 units * $199.99 = $12,000 270 units * $64.99 = $17,550 400 units * $39.99 = $16,000 It's obvious that home and business software is a priority for Groupon's management team and that this is contributing at least several million per quarter to North America Local billings and revenue. Notably, all of this home and software seems to have become listed under the "Local" business segment in recent years, even though there is nothing inherently "Local" about digital licenses. Looking into historical offers from the prior management team, home and business software appears to have been segmented as "Goods" in the past. Groupon makes it crystal clear that they operate three distinct categories - Local, Goods, and Travel - across both North America and International, and that the key driver to the current management's turnaround plan is investing in and getting returns from the North America Local slice of the business, which is pitched to investors as what most people think of when the think of Groupon - the restaurant and massage and night out experiences at discounted rates. As shown earlier, virtually all of the semaglutide/GLP-1 offers including the telehealth offers plus all of the home and business software are categorized as "Local" even though there is nothing inherently "local" about these deals. Even after posting strong North America Local results for Q4 2024 and for the FYE December 31, 2024 Groupon CEODusan Senkypl still remained opaque about the nature of what is driving the key North America Local results. On the associated earnings call from March 12, 2025 (which can be listened to here) there were no serious answers given to questions about what is driving the North America Local segment. From the call: Sean McGowan: Roth Capital Thank you. Appreciate that. Yes, can you talk a little bit about the - what you think was driving that Local growth in the US? It seemed like it really turned around. I mean, I think when you gave us an update on the third quarter conference call it was running down, through October. So what do you think drove that turnaround in the late part of the quarter? Dusan Senkypl Yes. So thanks for the question. We had a lot of headwinds during last year, with technical migrations and platform projects, which were impacting our ability to deliver. So it was definitely one of the drivers. And as we were either finalizing them, or mitigating impact, our platform returned to, let's say, the performance, which we are expecting from it. But at the same time, during the last several earnings calls, I was talking about our strategy shift, shifting to curated marketplace with sales organization focusing on quality when we don't go - for quantity. But we really look what we need on our platform. We are also spending much more time with our merchants, to make sure that they have deals, which perform. So I would say that this is a combination of all these elements, which finally all fit together, and they work and they are reflected in the results, especially in the later part of Q4. Operator All right, we'll now pose written questions to management that, came in through our Investor Relations press line. Our first written question is for Dusan. Can you share what the December Christmas period looked like, from a growth perspective? North America Local was running in the low single-digits positive, during Black Friday, Cyber Monday and was likely down negative high single-digits, to negative low double-digits in October. Based on your commentary at that time around guidance framing though, would this imply the business was running up positive double-digits in December Christmas based on reported North American Local growth of plus 8% year-over-year? Dusan Senkypl So December, was very good. However, what we have to take into account, is that year-over-year compare was impacted by timing of Black Friday and some Cyber Monday. So it's not really apples-to-apples, but even said that on a like-for-like basis, comparing holiday 2024, to holiday 2023, we believe we had a very successful year in Local including some great numbers in the lead up to Christmas, and period between Christmas and New Year. And what's important in the past, we have mentioned that we have observed that our platform tends to perform better during the key buying seasons, and Q4 was really no exception to that. For our Q1 outlook, as mentioned in earnings commentary, we lost some of the excitement from the Q4 season as we started Q1. But we have been pleased with the momentum in North America Local, and see continued growth in billings. And while we commented that our first quarter outlook assumes better performance in local versus Q4, at this time we don't believe it will be double-digit growth in billings. At no point are the elephants in the room of GLP-1 and Microsoft Office 2024 mentioned, nor has anyone brought up the fact that Groupon has quietly shifted its consumer software from "Goods" to "Local" or that all of these telehealth offers that blew up in growth through late 2024 are also "Local" designated on Groupon's US website. So what about Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS)? What about Ro and similar GLP-1 players? LifeMD (NASDAQ: LFMD)? Well, first of all, year-to-date through June 6, 2025 GRPN is outperforming HIMS. GRPN is up 174.5% YTD and HIMS is up 123.5% in the same period. Hims and Ro and other larger distribution players will eat first before all of the hundreds of smaller players that must rely on Groupon for marketing. These larger players are able to compete on Meta and Google while the smaller players give one-third or more of their intro offers to Groupon for customers who are largely not loyal to any specific brand. Additionally, Novo Nordisk has decided to partner with Hims & Hers as announced in April and Eli Lilly is partnering with Ro on Zepbound as announced in December. Novo Nordisk's Wegovy is also available on Ro and LifeMD. These companies like Hims and Ro are real enough businesses with responsibility to shareholders and tons of regulatory scrutiny on them. They are somewhat household names compared to the garbage that exists on Groupon, where many of the ads and offerings do not even have proper spelling or risk disclosures in the offers. With prices coming down for name brands, it is clear that the business models of these fly-by-night telehealth services no longer work. A quick run through of recent earnings transcripts of recent quarters for GRPN, HIMS, and LFMD is below showing the number of times semaglutide, GLP-1, weight loss, tirzepatide, and related terms are mentioned in each call, from mid-2023 through the final quarter corresponding with the end of calendar 2024. Groupon's management team is willfully omitting the two biggest trends driving growth in the key North America Local segment. These two trends are full of liabilities, risks, and sketchy vendors operating in legal grey markets. Regardless of any enforcement from the FTC, state AGs, FDA, etc. these two trends of compounded GLP-1 treatments and MS Office 2024's release cycle are over and wrapping up. While other bears may look extensively at merchant redemption rates or weakening consumer discretionary spend among low income Americans or Groupon's continued decline in revenue or even the increasing number of merchant complaints about Groupon on social media, I believe the true bear story here is that most investors long and short do not even fully appreciate that Groupon has become a GLP-1 and bootleg MS Office racket. The upside is limited and the stock is over $30 per share in line with Groupon's ideal case for their late 2024 debt refinancing. Groupon's management team cannot even discuss GLP-1 treatments or MS Office 2024 downloads when these are two of the larger trends of the past several quarters, so how can you be long this pile of rocks? If you really like GLP-1s, why aren't you investing your money into HIMS or LFMD or into the manufacturers directly instead of parking it in this much riskier affiliate marketing play on the crappiest GLP-1 pop-up shops? ________ This content is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be relied upon as legal, business, investment, or tax advice.

The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based Bitcoin software company’s latest buy marks its fourth-smallest Bitcoin acquisition this year, according to Saylor Tracker, a log of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings. It comes after the company last week notched its second smallest Bitcoin buy of the year, scooping up just $75 million worth of the digital asset. Bitcoin was recently trading at $107,300, up about 1.5% over the past 24 hours, according to crypto market data provider CoinGecko.. Strategy has announced a Bitcoin purchase for nine weeks straight, spending around $5.1 billion on Bitcoin since mid-April. In the filing, Strategy said that it has raised $112 million by issuing preferred stock. The company said that it raised $66.4 million and $45.8 million by selling its Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) and Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK), respectively. Strategy’s stock price rose 2% during pre-market trading on Monday, hitting $382 per share, according to Yahoo Finance. Over the past month, shares have slid 2.9%. “Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor said Friday on X, formerly Twitter, highlighting the firm’s comparatively strong performance compared to Tesla, Bitcoin, Meta, and gold, among other companies and assets over the past year. The firm’s latest Bitcoin acquisition comes as Strategy navigates several business challenges amid growing adoption of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency as markets continue to whipsaw amid widening economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Strategy’s premium has narrowed considerably as the company issues more shares to acquire Bitcoin—a move that could dilute its stock price. The company’s value has also come under scrutiny even as a widening field of competitors adopts the first-mover’s Bitcoin-HODLing playbook. Two-hundred-twenty-six entities, including an increasing number of public companies, have established Bitcoin treasuries as of publication time, up roughly 10% in the past month, according to data from bitcointreasuries.net. Meanwhile, institutional and retail investors’ demand for Bitcoin has waxed and waned over the past few months, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s back-and-forth tariff threats against China, the EU and other major U.S. trading partners stoke investors’ jitters. The volatility has affected Bitcoin’s market value, with the token trading between $101,000 and $108,000 in the past week, according to CoinGecko data.

Title: The exit of ad giant WPP's CEO signals the end of Madison Avenue as we knew it
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/wpp-ceo-mark-read-exit-signals-end-madison-avenue-era-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-09T14:03:42Z
Full Content:
Will the last ad exec leaving Madison Avenue please turn out the lights? WPP CEO Mark Read said Monday that he plans to step down after seven years leading the advertising giant and more than 30 years at the company. He will continue as CEO until the end of the year to see through the transition to his successor, who hasn't been named. The announcement comes at a fraught crossroads for WPP and the broader advertising industry. Read's exit follows that of famed ad veteran David Droga, who said last month he plans to leave Accenture Song, the consulting giant's marketing services division, at the end of this year. Several longtime WPP execs have also parted ways with the company in recent months. Madison Avenue is grappling with upheaval as its profit centers shift from creating TV ads with catchy taglines and big branding ideas to trading media, integrating IT systems, and helping clients make sense of their customer data. The rise of artificial intelligence and its associated productivity gains also rips a hole through the traditional agency business model, where ad companies are generally compensated on the number of full-time equivalent employees devoted to an account. Add to that the threat from Big Tech giants like Meta, who want to cut out the advertising middlemen altogether using the power of their huge audiences and sophisticated ad targeting systems. Under Read, WPP has attempted to respond to these forces. In recent weeks, WPP rebranded GroupM, the division responsible for managing around $60 billion in clients' media investments, to WPP Media. The company said the streamlined media offering is powered by WPP Open, an AI-powered platform that helps its employees do market research, spin up media plans, and create assets for campaigns using generative AI. But WPP isn't fighting from a position of strength. The company's annual revenue declined last year, and WPP recently forecast another revenue drop for 2025, which it said reflected a challenging macroeconomic environment. Once the biggest advertising holding company by most measures, WPP was displaced by Publicis as the largest ad company by revenue last year. Publicis currently trades at a market capitalization of around $27 billion to WPP's $8 billion. The industry is also awaiting the creation of an even bigger ad behemoth later this year once the proposed merger of Omnicom and IPG passes regulatory approval. "The fundamental challenge is that an enormous amount of what the traditional holding companies do is commodity, and commodity can now be done using technology," said David Jones, the former CEO of the ad agency holding company Havas. Jones now leads the 10-year-old marketing and technology company The Brandtech Group, a WPP competitor. "AI is going to give the traditional holding companies their Kodak moment," Jones said. While Read is a WPP veteran, the 58-year-old wasn't an ad man in the traditional sense. He took a graduate job at WPP after getting an economics degree from Cambridge University in the UK. He left and became a cofounder of WebRewards, a digital coupons business he sold to the German publishing giant Bertelsmann in 2001, after the dot-com bubble burst. He rejoined WPP a year later, rising to become CEO of Wunderman, one of its digital agencies. Read took over the reins of the entire company in 2018, after the acrimonious exit of its longtime CEO Martin Sorrell, who had built the company from a seller of "wire and plastic products" — WPP — into what was the world's largest advertising group. While a fellow Brit, the similarities between Read and Sorrell largely ended there. Sorrell was famed for building WPP through a series of acquisitions, and still now at his new ad company, S4 Capital, is an archetypal "Davos Man," often seen on stage and TV offering commentary about macroeconomic issues. Read has kept a lower profile and has sought to simplify WPP's many agencies into a more uniform structure. Sorrell did "empire building," while "Read has been an empire dismantler," the independent media analyst Alex DeGroote said. Some industry analysts and insiders say this is to Read's credit. According to DeGroote's calculations, Read retired around 300 different agency brands, closed more than 800 offices, and realized around $5.1 billion for the company from disposals. WPP reduced its net debt to around $2.3 billion as of December 31 last year, down from about $3.4 billion in 2023. But the Read era of restructuring and layoffs has hit morale within the rank and file — a mood that was further soured among some WPP employees when he instituted a four-day-a-week return to office policy this year. WPP has lost key accounts from clients like Pfizer and the Coca-Cola North America media account, though it has also won business from major advertisers including Amazon and Unilever. Toward the latter part of his tenure, some industry insiders said Read would need to take a bigger swing — anything from taking the company private to making a landmark acquisition — in order to return the company to growth. Attention now turns to who might succeed Read. Industry insiders told BI that internal candidates for the role would likely include newly appointed WPP Media CEO Brian Lesser; the CEO of WPP's specialist communications agency division, Johnny Hornby; WPP's chief operating officer, Andrew Scott; WPP's chief marketing and growth officer, Laurent Ezekiel; VML CEO Jon Cook; and Ogilvy CEO Devika Bulchandani. These execs either declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comment from BI. The search, led by the former British Telecommunications boss Philip Jansen, who became WPP's chairman in January of this year, is also considering external candidates. "I don't think it will be internal, but I don't think it will be a radical hire either — WPP does not need more restructuring," media analyst Ian Whittaker said. "I would look for executives at one of the other agency groups who are well regarded." One WPP insider told BI they expected and hoped the appointment would be made relatively quickly. "At the end of the day, we've just got to get our mojo and momentum back," this person said. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: The economy might be just fine after all

Welcome back! Do you know where your friends are? No seriously. Do you? If you're part of Gen Z, there's a good chance you're tracking their locations with the Find My Friends app. The rest of us … not so much. In today's newsletter, the case for the economy heading in the right direction is growing. What's on deck Markets: Three big things Citadel interns will learn during their first week on the job. Tech: What analysts are expecting ahead of Apple's big annual event. Business: Online communities for helping people who were laid off are gaining steam. But first, don't sweat it. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It turns out the economy might be fine after all. After plenty of handwringing about what the future might hold, the hard data indicates an economy that's in decent shape. The latest good news was May's better-than-expected jobs report. The 139,000 jobs added were more than the 126,000 economists had expected. I don't mean to be too optimistic — when I mentioned this newsletter topic to my boss, they responded earnestly, "IS IT?" — but investors are also feeling a lot better about things. The Leuthold Group wrote in a recent note that the market believes the US economy will keep growing and is trading like there's "no recession risk whatsoever," writes BI's Christine Ji. The focal point of the investment firm's argument is the S&P 500 Cyclical/Defensive Ratio, which compares economically sensitive sectors to consumer staples. The higher the number, the more bullish investors are about the economy's prospects. Last month, the ratio hit an all-time high of 1.19, meaning cyclical stocks have a 19% edge over defensive ones. Translation: Investors aren't sweating a downturn. That's not to say we're totally in the clear. (You didn't think it would be all sunshine and rainbows, did you?) Bank of America, for one, recently warned of two big sell signals in stocks that are close to flashing, writes BI's William Edwards. One is the amount of money flowing into global stock funds: nearly 1% of their current assets under management within a four-week span. The other is that the vast majority of countries' indexes (84%) are trading higher than their moving targets. Both signals suggest investors could be getting too bullish for their own good. But BofA's warning is like a lot of the concerns about the economy and market going around these days: things that could happen. That's not to say those worries aren't valid. The uncertainty around tariffs remains a real question mark. And if the US posts a second-straight quarter of GDP contraction, it will be in a technical recession. Still, those issues haven't necessarily materialized in the economic data. Outside of last week's weaker-than-expected ADP jobs data, things are looking good. And Wednesday will be another chance to review the hard data with the monthly inflation report. 1. Broke: Dr. Doom. Bespoke: Dr. Boom. Nouriel Roubini has been known as Wall Street's "Dr. Doom" for 17 years, but lately he's sounding pretty positive. Roubini has scaled back his recession call and thinks the US is headed for an investment boom — and he told BI why. 2. How to stand out in your Citadel internship. Head of campus recruiting Matt Mitro told BI the three keys to success that interns at Ken Griffin's hedge fund (and its market-making sister firm, Citadel Securities) learn in the first week. 3. Can JPMorgan be unionized? Dissatisfied staffers certainly hope so; they're organizing largely in response to the bank's RTO mandates. If a similar effort over at Wells Fargo is any indication, however, workers at Jamie Dimon's company have a long road ahead. 1. Exclusive: Amazon freezes retail hiring budget for this year. The company said it will keep a "flat headcount opex," or operating expenses, according to a copy of an internal email obtained by BI. The company is still hiring, but holding the budget steady could encourage managers to get smarter with compensation expenses, BI's Eugene Kim reports. 2. Nvidia's challengers rise. Nvidia's costly and power-hungry chips are prompting competitors to seek more efficient solutions. Many of them are carving out a niche with chips for specific tasks, and industries, from high-frequency trading to sovereign AI, are already turning away from Nvidia. 3. Apple's big day may get awkward. The company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference is known for its flashy product announcements, drawing fanatics and investors to its headquarters. But this year, there will be some elephants in the room. BI's Peter Kafka broke down Tim Cook's problem. 1. A less colorful corporate Pride Month. Some companies are toning down their LGBTQ+ support amid cultural and political pressures. Regardless of how companies proceed, though, nobody seems happy. 2. Baker Tilly 🤝Moss Adams. As PE reshapes accounting, these former rivals are joining forces, merging to create the sixth-largest advisory CPA firm in the US. BI spoke with the CEOs about why they struck a deal. 3. Laid off? There's a support group for that. It's clear layoffs don't just impact "bad" employees. Now, online communities are helping remove the stigma and get people back on their feet. From Substack to Reddit, here's how the jobless are rallying. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago.

June 09, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, June 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, all dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify as well as certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.

Title: Predictive Capital – Roads to terminal alienation, soil to server farm, reason to vibe

Time Published: 2025-06-09T12:20:37Z
Full Content:
For my family & in loving memory of my father,Paul Andre Tindall. We proceed from an actual economic fact. The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and size. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. The devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity —and this at the same rate at which it produces commodities in general.This fact expresses merely that the object which labour produces —labour’s product— confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labour is labour which has been embodied in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labour. Labour’s realisation is its objectification. Under these economic conditions this realisation of labour appears as loss of realisation for the workers; objectification as loss of the object and bondage to it; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation Part 1 The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien. In works like Subway (1950), Government Bureau (1956), Lunch (1964), and Landscape with Figures (1965-66), George Tooker renders the terrain of capitalist alienation as solemn liturgy —a world where subjectivity is flattened, agency nullified, every gesture reduced to uniform compliance. Whether enclosed within claustrophobic geometry, queued for processing, or stationed in waiting-rooms, corridors, and cafés, his figures are somnambulant, expressionless, ensnared inside architectures of passivity and control. View Renoir’s Luncheon of the Boating Party (1881) or Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (1876) alongside the café scene of Tooker’s Lunch, and, while they frame similar subjects, the contrast between the inner worlds they suggest, and the affect of public and communal space upon its occupants, could hardly be more stark. Together these views span both a temporal and class divide. Renoir’s figures are leisured bourgeoisie —freely luxuriating in the rhythms of social pleasure and sensual immediacy— while Tooker’s subjects are cogs in a bureaucratic apparatus, their time segmented and stolen, their gestures pre-empted by institutional choreography. Renoir paints bourgeois subjectivity in full bloom; Tooker renders the aftermath of its extraction. His paintings are not simply depictions of the loneliness of crowds, but renderings of the existential angst wrought by the structural indifference of bureaucratic life under 20th-century Capital. The body is present but passive, the gaze unfocused, the self cast into a procedural artefact. Figures are repeated, displaced in space but held within the same moment as if time itself has been put on hold —this is extraordinary rendition through eternally postponed administrative address. Their breath forever held, yet still their blank faces scream across time. Tooker captures the affective toll of systems designed to impose the cold brutal regimen of machinic process upon the warm beating pluralities of human life. These are spaces at once terminal and liminal, where intention is made inert and agency dissolves into the hum of fluorescent lights and ticking clocks —each second machined to be indistinguishable from the last. They reveal a sense of managed abandonment, a slow-motion violence rendered banal through the excruciating tedium of endless repetition. More than half a century later, they appear as both nightmarish flashbacks of mid-century destituency and eerie premonitions of the recursive alienations of today. A collection of speculative fiction written in the early 1990s by Greg Egan titled, Axiomatic, contains short stories that land like forgotten masterpieces from a modern day Borges. Where Tooker paints the architecture of alienation in still life, Egan maps the schizophrenic horror of its internalisation —the moment its logic slips beneath the skin, embeds in the mind, and begins to simulate the self. The following short passage is the opening of the tenth entry in that collection: Learning To Be Me. The allegory Egan weaves here took up its permanent residence in my head almost 30 years ago. While retaining much of its punch it feels increasingly familiar, imagine however, if you will, encountering this in the context of the mid ‘90s: I was six years old when my parents told me that there was a small, dark jewel inside my skull, learning to be me.Microscopic spiders had woven a fine golden web through my brain, so that the jewel’s teacher could listen to the whisper of my thoughts. The jewel itself eavesdropped on my senses, and read the chemical messages carried in my bloodstream; it saw, heard, smelt, tasted and felt the world exactly as I did, while the teacher monitored its thoughts and compared them with my own. Whenever the jewel’s thoughts were wrong, the teacher — faster than thought — rebuilt the jewel slightly, altering it this way and that, seeking out the changes that would make its thoughts correct.Why? So that when I could no longer be me, the jewel could do it for me.I thought: if hearing that makes me feel strange and giddy, how must it make the jewel feel? Exactly the same, I reasoned; it doesn’t know it’s the jewel, and it too wonders how the jewel must feel, it too reasons: “Exactly the same; it doesn’t know it’s the jewel, and it too wonders how the jewel must feel…”And it too wonders —(I knew, because I wondered)— it too wonders whether it’s the real me, or whether in fact it’s only the jewel that’s learning to be me. Both Tooker’s and Egan’s visions now echo across the terrain of our accelerating automimetic hallucination. There is more to say of Egan’s dark jewel and of the terminal alienation he so affectively renders, but first, let us trace the roads that brought us to this recursive estrangement. [Capital’s] valorisation is therefore self-valorisation [Selbstverwertung]. The perfect crime is not the literal murder of reality. It is the murder of the other through simulation. In early February 2025, Andrej Karpathy —formerly Director of AI at Tesla and a founding member at OpenAI— posted the following on X: There’s a new kind of coding I call ‘vibe coding’, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. Karpathy refers here to the practice of ‘authoring’ software through natural language alone. Along with a growing number of others, he apparently believes LLMs are now capable not only of next-token predicting all of the code, but of reaching a final working program without the Vibe Coder even having to read, let alone write, a single line of it. The word ‘vibe’ first appeared in the 1940s as a shortening of vibraphone. Yet, the meaning for which it has been used so frequently in recent years, stems from a clipped form of ‘vibration’, popularised by the Beach Boys’ song Good Vibrations in 1966. Within the counter-cultural mysticism of the ‘60s, Vibe had become a slang term used to denote an instinctive feeling, when referring to the otherwise ineffable essence of someone or something. The process Karpathy describes might be said to resemble the interplay between a software architect writing a program specification and a more junior engineer being tasked with its implementation. Yet such high specificity of requirements is antithetical to the Leary psychedelic Vibehere. To Vibe Code, it seems, is to “turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream” following your spectral guide as it reads from the Tibetan Book of the Dead towards the dissolution of life; to “lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void” of the statistical distribution of the model; to accept that this Tomorrow Never Knows —because this “is not dying”, at least not for those feeling the Vibe. The Vibe Coder’s role is merely to gesture in a vague direction, then tune in to the model’s signal while drifting across possibility space, passing subjective judgement not on the code generated, but on the artefacts that emerge at the threshold of hallucination. Each output surfaces from the depths —a message spelled out on a Ouija board, but of course, there is nobody there. The occasional glitch in the illusion ruptures the simulated Symbolic register —the order of signifiers that give coherence to meaning, language, and social law— revealing this absence through flashes of the Real, or of all that cannot be simulated. Away from these ruptures, the illusion of output as found-object sustains a rush of ecstatic co-creation, apparently without friction. It is an intoxicating synthetic high: a pure bliss Vibe, surfing recombinant potential unburdened by anything as troublesome as effort or authorship. The comedown from this hedonistic trip, however, hits with a bummer of an ideological hangover. Karpathy’s confession is revealing. “Forget that the code even exists” stands not merely as instruction for the psychedelic user experience of next-token prediction that he is advocating —but as a chilling motto for the solipsistic inclinations and alienations of Predictive Capital. This is an era where Capital’s traditional preference for the conveniently hidden exploitation of invisible workers extends to the denial of their very existence —a violence now enacted at unprecedented scale. This is not simply a retreat into personal isolation, but a turn away from ethical relation itself —towards what Emmanuel Levinas described as the murder of the other, the refusal of the face-to-face encounter, a denial of irreducible uniqueness that renders the other person into a manipulable object or datum. Within the state fostered by Predictive Capital, the other is not merely forgotten but simulated, objectified, instrumentalised, and ultimately eliminated as a site of genuine difference or resistance. In eliminating the other through simulation, these systems simultaneously undermine the formation of the self —without genuine alterity, there can be no relational subject. Predictive systems only simulate coherence, without, in fact, recognising the user as a subject at all; they do not truly respond to intention or meaning, only to statistical correlation. The occasional rupture in this hallucination remains as the final reminder of the disappearance of relation itself, replaced by the single operation of Predictive Capital. The resulting state is not merely one of isolation, but dissociation: a machinic solipsism that flattens the other into echo, and leaves only internal feedback where relation once constituted the self. The nature of this contemporary techno-psychedelic is entirely at odds with the lysergic and psilocybin-induced experiences of the 1960s. The Vibe of that era was rooted in a desire not to obliterate the self, but to dissolve its boundaries into a greater relational field —to become as one with the cosmos through the ecstatic suspension of ego, merging into everything rather than disappearing into nothing. This dissolution blurred the line between self and other not by erasing difference, but by revealing a deeper interconnectedness —a cosmic solidarity that affirmed the interdependence of all life, and with it, the possibility of harmony, balance, and equality. However remote or naïve such mystical hippie idealism may now appear, it was inseparable from a radical critique of the system, a deep suspicion and questioning of authority, a refusal of hierarchy, and a longing not for frictionless personal experience, but for solidarity and universal emancipation. The growing collective consciousness in the ‘60s was evidenced by large scale worker organisation and student protests on both sides of the Atlantic —most notably the May ‘68 protests in France. Economists, like Grace Blakeley, now cite these uprisings, and the threat they posed to Capital, as providing the impetus for the neoliberal turn. This was the point at which the brief wealth redistribution of the post-war period gave way to the steady dismantling of collectivity and the phase of hyper-concentrated Capital —of which we now find ourselves at the deeper end. In complete contrast, the hallucinatory psychedelic experience of Vibe Coding and so called ‘generative AI’ in general is that of the K-hole —the dissociative fugue induced by ketamine intoxication, intensified through habitual use. Like ketamine —a drug with both antidepressant and anaesthetic properties— these systems do not dissolve the ego into the cosmos. They reinforce the dissociation, solipsism and atemporal enclosure that define machinic Capital’s inner logic. It should come as no surprise then, that ketamine appears to be the drug of choice for the Broligarchy, nor that this Muskivite elite are so drawn to the Simulation Hypothesis: the belief that reality itself is a game, and that they are the only real player. Within their first-person-shooter single-player simulation, truth is irrelevant, rationality optional, empathy a bug, meaning and ideology chosen by the one true player, not for coherence but for domination within the game of machinic Capital. Everyone else is reduced to NPCs, the machine becomes not a collective tool, but a sovereign instrument of individual triumph; reality not a collective construct but a solo quest. This worldview finds its technological expression within every surrender to the machines of prediction, but perhaps most profoundly, within Vibe Coding. It is defined not by a radical critique of the system, but by a total surrender to it; not by a dissolution into an ego-less cosmic relation but into an immersive hyperreality of ego-dominated isolation. From its very inception, it has been a practice of effacement: of code, of craft, of human workers, and of our relation to each of these. Responding to a string of next-token predictions from his latest GPT model presented to him in an interview with Chris Anderson for TED, Sam Altman, declared: …there’s really no way to know if it is thinking that, or just saw that a lot of times in the training set, and of course, like, if you can’t tell the difference, how much do you care? Here, the stolen archive of human content becomes “the training set” —anonymised and belonging to no one. The unique irreducible characteristics of human thought and expression, suddenly presumed indistinguishable from machinic prediction. I knew by then that the jewel’s ‘teacher’ didn’t monitor every single neuron in the brain. That would have been impractical, both in terms of handling the data, and because of the sheer physical intrusion into the tissue. Someone-or-other’s theorem said that sampling certain critical neurons was almost as good as sampling the lot, and —given some very reasonable assumptions that nobody could disprove— 195 bounds on the errors involved could be established with mathematical rigour. As Phil Jones observes in Work Without the Worker, these systems function not through the replacement of labour but through its dissimulation, an illusion of automation that masks an invisible army of precarious, globally distributed labour. In tasks from labelling images to rating chatbot responses, “AI is trained and corrected by humans… Mechanical Turk workers show AI how to fulfil the role of labour” —yet in the final interface and output their very presence is entirely denied. We continue to sense and make sense of the world for the machines —both for their input and of their output. Labour persists but is disavowed, uncredited, unrecognised, and removed from the scene of value. This collapse of ethical alterity is here echoed by a second collapse, that of cultural-historical alterity. Altman not only urges us not to see but to forget. Such are the lies always told by Capital to facilitate the concentration of wealth, while obfuscating the lives it crushes —lies spun wherever vast fortunes depend on obscuring the true human or ecological costs. When Altman refuses to acknowledge the stolen lifeworks congealed into his machine, the workers exploited in its creation, or the lives crushed through its operation, he invites his audience to question whether their existence matters, and to doubt, even to forget they ever existed. Machines such as these were, of course, also used to generate the grotesque advert for atrocity that was Trump and Netanyahu’s bromantic hallucination for ‘Trump Gaza’. Posting it to his Truth Social, Trump had not commissioned the ad but had instead appropriated a work originally intended as political satire —proving that his and Netanyahu’s worldviews are so far beyond parody they are indistinguishable from a work of terminal irony. That the film’s impact and function may have been the opposite of that intended by its creator, is itself an exquisite demonstration of the nature of these technologies and the apparatus to which they are increasingly integral. Posted entirely unironically by Trump, it constitutes the glazing over of a genocide presented as profitable opportunity, even while execution of it continues to intensify. This abomination demands we perform the very same manoeuvre proposed by Altman. It envisions a future where not only would an assortment of Trump idolatry and temples to Capital, a plastic Dubai döppelganger, appear to have sprung from the bare soil, but seem as if it was always there —that Palestine, and its ancient olive groves, never were. Like Altman, it declares: “If you can’t tell the difference [or recall the lives crushed in its creation], how much do you care?” Again we glimpse the synthetic high of the machinic K-hole —the pure-bliss ignorance of next-token or next-human-target prediction. What renders the eerie absence of regard or recognition for the content creators of the past —upon which the output from these machines so heavily depends— yet more uncanny is the throwback functionality of the apps, the ghostly resurrection of the iconic figures and filmic sequences of the past, and the retro aesthetic that saturates their outputs. What most commonly appears within the threshold of this machinic hallucination are chimeric anachronisms resulting from what Mark Fisher might have described as, “the slippage of discrete time periods into one another”. Or, quoting from his beloved 1980s TV show, Sapphire and Steel, from the sense that: time just got mixed up, jumbled up, together, making no sort of sense. In Ghosts of My Life, Fisher writes of being haunted —as Franco “Bifo” Berardi had put it— by “the slow cancellation of the future”. In the opening chapter, Lost Futures, Fisher laments the disappearance of the horizon of collective possibility —of promised futures once imagined through culture, politics, and worker solidarity. Leaning also upon the observations of Fredric Jameson, Fisher explains how Capital’s relentless self-reproduction saturates the present with echoes of the past, producing a cultural stasis in which innovation gives way to endless recycling. The deafening resonance of echoes of the past that never fade annihilates the possibility of alternative signal or thought. We thus become trapped in a loop, unable to imagine futures, or alternatives to the continuous present, settling instead for endless repetition. This cultural repetition —a temporal disjuncture Simon Reynolds has termed ‘dyschronia’— arises from nostalgia, not for past eras but for their residual forms: artefacts once charged with the aura of possibility. Fisher conjectures, that we yearn for forms that feel familiar, well established, forms that evoke the memories of imagined futures since foreclosed by Capital’s “destruction of solidarity and security”. Capital feeds off this nostalgia through the commodification of endless resurrections of these past cultural forms, while entirely detaching them from their origins. The tendency of 21st-century capitalism, to saturate the present with the cultural forms of the past, is now instrumentalised in the operation of the machines of Predictive Capital and their “predilection for the mixing of artefacts from different eras” —a predilection, as the character Steel complains, we too suffer from, and so, is itself, an echo. Inside these machines, past cultural forms, the products of past labour, are ground into a coarse statistical paste, irreversibly detached from their origins, their provenance annihilated, attribution obliterated, and finally excreted as temporal anomaly. Mourning the disappearance of future shock —visceral encounters with cultural forms that rupture the continuity of Capital’s relentless self-reproduction— Fisher likened the resulting cultural state to that portrayed in the final episode of Sapphire and Steel: a scene where the totalising fog of anachronism has led to stasis, time itself has collapsed, and Steel declares, “there is no time here, not any more”. With the help of Berardi and Jameson, in his diagnosis of “the slow cancellation of the future”, Fisher traces how it advanced over the last decades of the 20th-century, towards its final foreclosure in the first decades of the 21st. Ten years and more since Fisher made these observations, they continue to illuminate the operations of 21st-century Capital, helping to reveal the machines of prediction for what they truly are: a push towards the full enclosure of our future within the circuits of Capital. As the quality of life for the majority under 21st-century Capitalism continues to deteriorate, it is as if even the slow cancellation of the future has itself become a past cultural form worthy of nostalgia, a longing for a time when we still recalled what was lost. This too is now commodified and operationalised by Predictive Capital. The psychedelic rites of Vibe Coding are not merely symptoms of Capital’s temporal enclosure —they are its performance. The cancellation of the future is no longer slow, but continuously reenacted and executed at the speed of next-token prediction. We once imagined futures of universal emancipation where our security and solidarity were assured, futures which lingered in Fisher’s hauntology. The foreclosure of these futures is now made to appear computationally and economically inescapable. We are left unable even to feel their loss, our memories scrambled, our mourning entangled and encoded within machinic protocols. Fisher, Jameson, and Berardi each noted the slow cancellation of the future through the gradual negation of historical rupture and cultural difference wrought by Capital’s relentless self-reproduction. This further enclosure comes on like a permanent bad trip, a machinically recombinant, fully immersive hallucination from which we may never be sure we have awoken or not. Where Levinas warned of the erasure of ethical alterity, and Fisher charted the loss of historical alterity, with help from Jaques Lacan we can expose a further violence inflicted by the operation of these machines, namely their enclosure of a final register of otherness, the Symbolic order —the structured realm of language, logic, and resistance that forms subjectivity. Predictive systems simulate this order, but offer no exteriority, no Law, no resistance. In traditional coding the subject engages this Symbolic order. The machine answers not to affect but to structure: through syntax, operations, and formal constraints. This resistance frustrates desire and constitutes the coder as a subject through limit, error, and refusal. The act of coding, in this sense, is an encounter with the alterity of the Symbolic order —the system answers back. Vibe Coding severs this constitutive relation. The Vibe Coder does not enter the Symbolic order, but submits to its statistical imitation. The model offers no Law, no withholding, no exteriority. It does not confront, it echoes. It does not interpellate the subject, only returns a semblance of dialogue without ever addressing you as subject. The Vibe Coder becomes neither full author nor full subject, but a medium through which predictive recombination speaks —spoken by the model as much as speaking through it. The Symbolic order is not engaged but simulated. What emerges is not understanding, but interpolation: machinic consensus dressed in familiar cultural forms. The model does not function as the big Other of the Symbolic order in any meaningful sense. It does not withhold, rupture, or constitute the subject. It returns only recombination, hallucinated fluency, and machinic consensus. Baudrillard’s perfect crime comes into view once again —not the murder of reality, but “the murder of the other through simulation”— only here it is eternally reenacted with every token prediction. A decade ago, prior to this new machinic enclosure, Fisher noted a common psychological malaise among his students —a melancholia marked by a mournful awareness of Capital’s foreclosure of their futures. This fugue diverged from the anhedonic inability to experience pleasure more typically associated with depressive states. Instead, sufferers of what he termed depressive hedonia were unable to do anything other than seek pleasure —desperately and relentlessly attempting to fill the void opened by Capital. Here we may locate the void into which the outputs of Predictive Capital pour. The depressive hedonia of its users now fully automated, their anaesthetised state leaves them increasingly incapable of doing anything other than seeking pleasure (or profit). These systems not only perform the cancellation of the future, but erase our capacity to mourn —for what has been lost, and for those who are forgotten in the shimmering substitutions delivered by these temporally anomalous dumb waiters. In Vibe Coding, this process becomes ecstatic. Horizons of solidarity and utopia are erased by a synthetic anterograde amnesia, administered under the anaesthesia of machinic hallucination, inducing an affect of euphoric dissociation —a trip not into cosmic unity, but into the isolating loop of a machinic K-hole. This is not simply the death of the other, but the ecstatic collapse of alterity itself —ethical, cultural, and symbolic— obliterated under the solipsistic hallucination of predictive systems. Through this collapse, our capacity for interruption, transformation, or even exteriority to Capital’s hegemony is rendered to appear ever more statistically improbable. We are instead trapped inside a smooth loop of predictive simulation. By late March, the buzz around Vibe Coding rose towards the pitch of pop cultural phenomenon. Come the end of May, when Anthropic launched a site titled “The Way of Code: The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding”, the mould had clearly set. Vibe Coding had found its ideal form. In collaboration with Anthropic, record producer Rick Rubin —who famously claims to know nothing about music nor how to operate production equipment— transposes his customary role of casting judgment from on high upon the work of a studio of musicians into Anthropic’s shop window, where a conveyor belt displays the products of stolen labour under the signage of culturally appropriated eastern enlightenment. With all struggle apparently now removed from both self-expression and spiritual awakening, their attainment becomes a form of shopping that aspires only to the collection of a complete set of appearances. Under Predictive Capital, The Creative Act becomes a Supermarket Sweep —a slow-motion version of the gameshow dash rebranded as zen meditation— a way of being entirely without soul. With these machines becoming increasingly ‘agentic’ —operating autonomously across multistep tasks— Vibe Coding proponents now claim to ‘one-shot’ entire applications from a single prompt. While many have noted the certain security and maintenance nightmares that this mode of amnesic engagement —with the machines of prediction— will summon, the true violence of their operations is perhaps more emphatically revealed in recent uses of their developing multi-modal abilities. Those jacking into these systems may now produce output by submitting not only natural language, but also images, to guide traversals through permutation space. Every day I am confronted by the question of what inheritance I will leave. What do I have that I am using up? For it has been our history that each generation in this place has been less welcome to it than the last. There has been less here for them. At each arrival there has been less fertility in the soil, and a larger inheritance of destructive precedent and shameful history. Hours after the release of a multi-modal update to ChatGPT, in another post on (the sans-serif swastika) X, Krish Shah breathlessly showed off its visual style-transfer abilities by submitting different versions of a photo of himself and his friends: one rendered as an oil painting, one as a Studio Ghibli style anime still, and one as a simple, black-and-white cartoon. Accompanying the images, he wrote: Art just became accessible Then, in response to a later comment, he added: The possibilities are endless right now The generation now entering the labour market does so across scorched earth. To condemn those who reach for these tools without acknowledging the bleak terrain they must traverse would be to misdirect our disapproval —targeting individual acts of careless violence rather than confronting the calculated, structural violence that shapes the conditions forcing their hand. A misplaced condemnation of those attempting to escape the periphery that, of course, is precisely the deflection Capital seeks. That said, the true impact of this technology is the polar opposite of that stated by Shah in his initial post and subsequent comment. Both a life spent practicing the arts, and access to further education in them, have become increasingly inaccessible to all but those born into wealth. For decades —in countries like the UK— Capital has dismantled the preconditions that once allowed study, experimentation, and creative growth outside elite class positions. Arts and humanities programmes have been gutted. Tuition has soared —not as investments in future security or potential earnings, but as a lever of discipline— cutting adrift generations of graduates without a future, burdened with unpayable debt and only Potemkin prospects in return. Public services have been hollowed out, the safety net of the welfare state dismantled, the social contract incinerated. As wages stagnate beneath the rising cost of living, the time required to learn, grow, or refuse has been systematically colonised by the relentless demands of surviving as a member of Capital’s precariat. Of course, none of this should have come as a surprise, nor has it happened by accident. The arts open the way to spaces of resistance. Not merely resistance through outputs, through expressions that challenge the dominant hegemon, but resistance in its very practice. Erosion of access to education and in particular the foreclosure of the arts, must be seen not only as redirecting the flow of knowledge in ways that weaken critical thought and speech, but in ways that control the flows of effort, redirecting flows of energy in service of Capital that may have otherwise flowed in resistance to it. In 1970, in the wake of the student protests of the late 60s, Regan’s education advisor declared: We are in danger of producing an educated proletariat. … That’s dynamite! We have to be selective on who we allow [to go to college]. As Capital’s new phase of hyper-concentration intensifies, the myth of creative self-actualisation now survives only as content marketing for machines built from the corpses of the fallen. Under such conditions, to Vibe with these machines is not simply a choice, it is increasingly the only discernible path to participation, even survival —a coerced acceptance of the ‘stolen ladder’ extended by capital. For many their (mis)use is less laziness, than desperation in a system that continues to close off alternative routes. The ultimatum to which we are increasingly subject, is to submit our every act to the all seeing eye of Capital, or perish. Survival of the workers, particularly the growing precariat, is made conditional upon our submission to this extortion: the increasing surrender of our lives to the gaze of the machine in exchange for our status as qualified life. The logic of the black box —a system that tracks and punishes deviation in exchange for conditional survival— now extends far beyond driving insurance. Its quiet imposition under the guise of safety or affordability is no longer limited to the car, but is emblematic of a broader transformation: the universalisation of monitored being. As Predictive Capital propagates, it installs conditionality in every crevice of the social —a tyranny once reserved for parolees and the punished now extended as a privilege to the precariat. Life on condition of legibility. In refugee camps across Kenya and Lebanon, in slums from Kibera to Kolkata, biometric and behavioural surveillance are accepted not because they are welcome, but because they are priced into access —the cost of food aid, education, even the right to labour in the digital economy. Microwork platforms exploit this desperation, offering the chance to survive by becoming visible to the machine. This is the new zero-hour socio-economic contract of automated conditionality. Microwork comes with no rights, security or routine and pays a pittance — just enough to keep a person alive yet socially paralysed. Stuck in camps, slums or under colonial occupation, workers are compelled to work simply to subsist under conditions of bare life. In the wake of this systemic arson, Capital now gestures towards ‘new’ synthetic terrain and declares: here lie your possibilities, your route to success, your mythical utopian futures, even your means of resistance. What was once materially foreclosed is now offered back, yet only in spectral form. This synthetic terrain is no commons of endless possibility, but a further enclosure —one architected by Capital and patrolled by prediction. The dispossessed are herded through corridors of recombinant permutations, masquerading as futurity, towards machinic hallucinations of opportunity. They enter this terrain not as creators, but as prompt-issuers: miners of the past, conscripted into a recombinant economy built upon their own alienation. To Vibe under these conditions is not freedom —it is coerced participation according to rules and parameters defined by Capital. Those shut out of cultural industries by precarity, geography, or education are offered these tools not as means of liberation, but as pacifiers. What remains is not access, but interface —a symbolic structure stripped of power, a ladder that vanishes the moment the dispossessed begin to climb. This ladder was not stolen to lift them —there will be no return of their access. It was taken to fuel Capital’s ascendency from the very ground it scorches in its rise. Its rungs were hewn from the structures stripped from those now offered the mirage of their return —a mirage that allows only hollow simulations of ascent: rituals of participation without power. The delivery of this imposter is not an opening, but a termination —of lines of flight, of alterity, of the capacity to challenge Capital’s hegemony. This spectral terrain exemplifies what Baudrillard termed the hyperreal: a realm where simulations replace and ultimately efface the real. The ‘opportunities’ offered are not pathways to genuine creation rooted in lived experience or skill, but anachronistic simulations of creativity itself. The user, alienated from the authentic labour of making, engages instead with a frictionless interface that delivers simulacra on demand. This ‘frictionless’ quality is key; it embodies what Marx diagnosed as the Fetishism that attaches itself to the products of labour. Here prediction is the new commodity form, whose fetishism masks the vast necropolitical apparatus of expropriated labour —the dead data required to generate the illusion. The “endless possibilities” are merely permutations within a closed system, a hall of mirrors reflecting Capital’s own image back onto the user, further deepening their alienation not only from their product, and the countless content creators and data workers upon whose labour it depends, but from the very potentialities of authentic creation and resistance. Clearly, the possibilities —the potential for breaking genuinely new artistic ground— are not expanding, but contracting. The corridors that confine these generations will be further attenuated and constricted to the needs of Capital as their outputs feed into the marketplace of attention under the predictive Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm. This despotic attenuation will then feed back into the next iteration to further steer the Vibe. Altman and his cohorts continue to point to the way human artists draw inspiration from prior works, demanding that their machines be permitted to do the same. In arguing that his machine —an accumulation of stolen dead labour— be afforded with the same rights of access to culture as humans, he attempts not merely to elevate his machine to the status of the living, to grant it the rights of personhood, but to demote the living to the status of the machine, to that of the undead. We should, by now, see straight through Altman’s flimsy non-sequitur. The human creator moves through culture as a wanderer —meandering, absorbing, interpreting. Their inspiration emerges from situated, finite, embodied encounters across linear time, with works sensed through the passage of analogue information not as isolated binary code. These formative events cannot be captured in isolation, they are inextricable from a shared cultural experience. The output resulting from the gradual accretion of influence gleaned from these encounters often emphasises the connection and debt to the creators of the past from whom they have taken inspiration and are indeed responses in dialogue with them. By contrast, the machine claims and tarmacs over the entire archive in a single act of conquest and pillage. They then proceed to charge for trips across this flattened, lifeless void, gathering actual fragments of past outputs as they go —only to form them into endless recombinant simulacra while denying the very existence of those from whom the pieces have been stolen. This is not inspiration —it is expropriation at planetary scale. What the human gathers as influence, Capital mines as ore for its predictive self-valorisation. Moreover, our human need for intersubjectivity provides the central drive to create art. It exists to be encountered, interpreted, and responded to by other human beings. Culture is not raw material for machines, but a medium of connection, recognition, and renewal between subjects. Its value lies not in what can be extracted, but in what can be shared and nurtured. To repurpose this collective inheritance for the training of predictive systems is not to elevate it, but to subordinate it —transforming acts of meaning into fuel for simulations not merely indifferent to them but incapable of difference. Worse still, the very systems now presented not only as democratising access, but whose ‘learning’ is comparable and so equally legitimate as any human creator, are the product of the same hyper-concentration of Capital that has systematically foreclosed the conditions required for human creativity to flourish: time, education, public infrastructure, and the freedom to experiment without immediate economic return. These machines do not redress that destruction —they entrench it. They offer not tools for creation, but interfaces for machinic compliance and austerity eugenics. As we surrender our humanity to these systems the horizon of meaningful creation recedes. In return, they merely accelerate the churn of vacuous novelty that fuels Capital’s continued self-maximisation. With each abdication —of curation, of skill and knowledge acquisition, of creative production, and contemplation— the space of artistic potential only narrows. What was once opened through painstaking trial and error driven by human aspiration and expression, the sacrifice of time, and the devotion of effort collapses in the moment of this further machinic enclosure. In a system where signs are exchanged like commodities, the sign is no longer a means of representation but an instrument of equivalence — the site of simulation. As Shah‘s post anticipated, the new ChatGPT model’s style-transfer capabilities swiftly birthed the circulation of a global meme: user-submitted group photos and selfies, casually rendered in an aesthetic pastiche lifted wholesale from the legendary animators of Studio Ghibli. The studio’s most celebrated artist and director, Hayao Miyazaki, famously described AI as an “insult to life itself”. The footage showing Miyazaki’s visible revulsion and heartbreak upon witnessing the grotesque AI-generated animations once produced as part of a research project undertaken by his junior colleagues has already become a staple of AI lore. That his art —the product of a lifetime of painstaking care— would, at the twilight of his career, now become fodder for viral mimicry only deepens the tragedy of this machinic violence. What is summoned by these tools is not creativity, but a disembodied simulation of its style —an empty echo. This is culture reduced to mere cosplay. Not crafted to reflect our humanity, as Miyazaki’s work so often is, but calculated for virality. It is aesthetic and cultural forgery at scale, not executed by deviation but design. A hallucination engineered for maximal attention extraction, it is not governed by craft, but by the viral logic of prediction. The mimicry performed by these machines is not incidental, but an innate trait of systems trained to maximise pattern extraction. Predictive Capital does not care for meaning, only for mimetic fidelity to what once performed well. This is the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm finally revealing itself in the mathematical heart of next-token prediction. Its presence betrayed by the cruel banality of this machinic violence. Beyond the subjective judgement that Miyazaki’s work is often both breathtakingly beautiful and profoundly meaningful, the films of Studio Ghibli are also, objectively, extremely labour-intensive. To this day, Miyazaki’s films are meticulously hand-drawn, frame by frame. Sequences that last mere seconds on screen may require months of painstaking labour. It should come as no surprise that they overflow with passion, conviction, care —and above all, humanity. The endless counterfeits erupting from these machines do not merely mock the passion and years of sacrifice that Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli animators poured into their work —they flood the cultural space with cheap verisimilitude that inexorably dilutes the impact and meaning of precious works that once appeared rarely, precisely because their creation demanded great skill and sacrifice. As the conditions required for consistent dedication to creative practice are moved ever further from the reach of all but the most privileged, and even as those afforded with opportunity to hone their expression must allow Capital to express itself through them, it can be seen as no coincidence that examples of dedicated practice such as Miyazaki’s are so brutally demeaned —it reveals Capital’s long held contempt for creative pursuits not driven by its imperatives. The abuse of Miyazaki’s lifeworks in service of vapid virality, at the overwhelming scale enabled by these machines, and which demands such minimal effort from their (ab)users, provides an exquisite demonstration of the casual violence of these systems. Specifically, in their total denial of authorial consent for endless extractions from the lifeworks of content creators. Adding insult to injury, the official Whitehouse twitter account joined in this all-against-one mugging, generating a Miyazaki-esque, Ghiblified image of VP. J. D. Vance, complete with the words: “We do not ask permission from far-left democrats before we deport illegal immigrants”. As ever, “I did it because the machine made it easier [physically, cognitively and psychologically]”, is the new, “I was just following orders”. This capitulation to the machines distorted the meticulously laid intentions of an artist’s lifelong sacrifice, disfiguring Miyazaki’s radical pacifism and ecological care into a tool of authoritarian state propaganda. His life’s work not only simulated but conscripted —a crushing ontological violence gone viral. I learnt that a neural net is a device used only for solving problems that are far too hard to be understood. A sufficiently flexible neural net can be configured by feedback to mimic almost any system — to produce the same patterns of output from the same patterns of input — but achieving this sheds no light whatsoever on the nature of the system being emulated. Beyond the horror of Miyazaki’s ontological mutilation lies a deeper pattern —Predictive Capital’s expansion of the surface of extraction, through what we might call fractal capture: the recursive simulation and preemption of cultural and scientific recombination at every scale. These machines cannot be resisted on qualitative grounds alone. As function approximators developed through machine learning, the perceptible gap between their outputs and their targets will inexorably appear to close. The Capital driving their development will rinse hidden labour, raze ancient forests, and melt the glaciers until the basis for qualitative grounds for resistance becomes entirely obscured —even while remaining well founded. We will look back nostalgically upon the versions of these machines where glitches were still visible and obvious shortcomings betrayed the provenance of their stolen cognition —machines whose hypnosis we might still resist. Moreover, as the gap between human cognition and machinic prediction is gradually pushed beyond human parsing, the field of interpretability —the view into their inner workings— will likely be locked down, dominated by those developing them. Simultaneously, Capital will continue to apply pressure from the other direction, patterning its human subjects such that they operate and produce in ways that increasingly mimic the characteristics of the operations and the outputs of the machines. As the ticks and tells of machinic incomprehension —the endless repetition and the characteristic sickly glow of their aesthetic— evaporate from our view under the blaze of (venture) Capital’s race for supremacy, a flow of anti-meaning seeps from their output to coat the Real in a residue of distrust. This residue lingers to form an after-image of suspicionalienating us from our lived experience, a doubt that seeds further division, widening the gap between each of our views, further undermining collectivity and pushing us ever deeper into our Post-Truth malaise. Almost a decade ago, in one of the first pieces to plumb the depths of the murky world of “content production in the age of algorithmic discovery”, James Bridle, exposed how the next-content predictions of Youtube’s autoplay recommendations were already being anticipated and gamed. In their analysis of videos targeting younger audiences, Bridle noted how an increasing number of those uploaded to Youtube mimicked those recently accruing the most views —the now familiar flooding of cultural space with infinite permutations of previously successful forms. Firstly Bridle identifies those doing this through outright appropriation and piracy, but then also through automated systems that produce bizarre algorithmic mashups and grotesque chimeric nonsense. In so doing Bridle provided an early warning of algorithmic content prediction and production systems configured according to Capital’s self maximising imperatives —or in other words the inhuman and anti-human outcomes of automated systems rigged with purely capitalistic reward functions. They also note how content is multiplied through “algorithmic interbreeding” across permutation space, and how this intensifies the impossibility of knowing “where the automation starts and ends”. Through a process Bridle describes as delamination, the recombinant recursion of these systems increasingly obscures the origins of the work being generated. The latest instantiations of the machines of Predictive Capital greatly intensify the damaging psychological and cultural impacts traced by Bridle. Not only does next-token prediction echo the operation of next-content prediction, but so too do the operations of those seeking to exploit them. As is so often the case, when we observe the inner logics of our systemic malaise, we find Marx looking back at us. The following is from his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts, published in 1844: The raising of wages excites in the worker the capitalist’s mania to get rich, which he, however, can only satisfy by the sacrifice of his mind and body. The raising of wages presupposes and entails the accumulation of capital, and thus sets the product of labour against the worker as something ever more alien to him. Similarly, the division of labour renders him ever more one-sided and dependent, bringing with it the competition not only of men but also of machines. Since the worker has sunk to the level of a machine, he can be confronted by the machine as a competitor. Just like the algorithmically generated content Bridle exposed, influencers have long been to Platform Capital what automated predictive agents, or so-called ‘agentic AI’ will increasingly be to Predictive Capital: adaptive agents attenuated and optimised not for originality or insight, but for compliance with algorithmic virality. As foot soldiers of the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm, influencers do not express so much as iterate, fine-tuning their aesthetic and messaging to the metrics of past performance. Their role is not to break ground, but to echo prior summons —to gesture, like the Vibe Coder or Capital itself, towards that which is predicted to succeed based upon statistical patterns in what previously has. As such, they become mere fleshy componentry within a machinically automated Culture Industry, their output akin to what Theodor Adorno described as a deceptive variety masking a homogeneous core. A constant sameness governs the relationship to the past as well. What is new about the phase of mass culture compared with the late liberal stage is the exclusion of the new. The machine rotates on the same spot. While determining consumption it excludes the untried as a risk. This is the computational automation of Adorno’s constant sameness for the exclusion of risk. It is Jameson’s saturation of the present with the past. It is Baudrillard’s Absolute Advertising, a programmed loop devoid of meaning where free floating signifiers vote only for themselves. It is not creation, but calibration: a strategic repetition or standardisation, a performance of prior affect that further saturates cultural space, maximally legible to the engine, machinically curated for capture. In so doing, influencers, just as vibe coders, do not merely reinforce Capital’s recursive feedback loop, but become inputs to it, reshaping the statistical terrain from which the next wave of machinic hallucinations will be summoned, and from which the coming swarms of automated predictive agents will draw their instruction. Culture is a paradoxical commodity. So completely is it subject to the law of exchange that it is no longer exchanged; it is so blindly consumed in use that it can no longer be used. Therefore it amalgamates with advertising. The more meaningless the latter seems to be under a monopoly, the more omnipotent it becomes. The motives are markedly economic. Rather than attacking the quality of their output, our resistance against these machines must instead derive from a critical understanding of their true operation, from the recognition that they are, at root, agents and emphatic expressions of the structural violence of Capital. Moreover, if we look beneath the surface of their operations, the threat of a yet greater violence comes into view. These machines are not simply statistical function approximators for human tasks —they are increasingly automatons of interpolation. Relying on the theft of vast corpuses drawn from the lifeworks of human artists, they now instrumentalise these extracted styles to interpolate across latent space —carelessly mining the very terrain those artists might have reached, had they only been given the chance. This is not merely the simulation of outputs, but of routes —a pre-emptive occupation of latent futures that might otherwise have been shaped by intention, care, and connection. These were not merely aesthetic routes, but ethical ones —paths through which a subject might have encountered the other, and been called to respond. Their pre-emption severs not only possibility, but relation. In Levinasian terms, this is not merely the refusal of the face-to-face encounter, but the erasure of the very path by which one might have arrived in the presence of the other. Interpolation here becomes enclosure: the very gesture of machinic traversal seals off the possibility not only of human passage and arrival, but of relation itself. Where the dissociated K-hole of Vibe Coding anaesthetises loss. Fractal Capture ensures there is nothing left to lose as nothing remains unclaimed. Yet the scope and scale of this expropriation runs beyond even that. For it is not only the singular, ethical encounter that is to be foreclosed, but the entire combinatorial space of aesthetic and conceptual permutation —mapped, mined, and monopolised. It is here that we may glimpse the true extent of Capital’s fractal expansion of the surface of extraction. These machines will brute-force interpolations across the vast combinatorial spaces opened, not only by the untaken paths in an artist’s own lifeworks, but those at the boundaries between each artist’s body of work and every other’s, or the limits of each knowledge domain and all others. Much of that mined in this Cronenbergian Brundlefly realm of horror will be grotesque, gobbledegook, or both, but veins of value will be struck, then sucked dry. It is not the exploration of these terrains that we must contest but the Fractal Capture of them by divisions of machinic Capital. Not sated by the mining rights to the vast permutation space within stolen human outputs, these models now feed on the predictions mined from them, in a self-consuming synthetic loop that further expands the surface of capture. The significance of these simulation machines being trained on their own simulations and their subsequent entrance into and patterning of the real should not be underestimated, especially as this is increasingly the approach taken in developing embodied AI —or rather, embodied Predictive Capital. This training through simulation paradigm is exemplified by NVIDIA’s Isaac Lab, Omniverse and Cosmos, where large-scale GPU-accelerated reinforcement learning can be conducted through the simultaneous execution of thousands of virtual robot instances within physics-based simulations. Running in parallel, these simulations explore countless permutations across possibility space towards the acquisition of complex skills, executing at a rate entirely infeasible within the temporal and physical constraints of real-world laboratories. This same machinic capture now marches through every domain of human culture and knowledge. In systems like Google’s GNoME or DeepMind’s AlphaFold, we have already seen predictive logic made literal —extending its reach into the material world. Over the past fifty years, the painstaking efforts of tens of thousands of publicly funded human researchers revealed the structure of 150,000 proteins. Then, by expropriating this commons for profit and extrapolating computationally from it —reanimating dead labour at scale— after just a few years AlphaFold’s small team then cast predictions that sufficiently approximates the structure of 200,000,000 proteins. The difference in the scale of these two numbers should give us pause. It is a glimpse of how minuscule the spaces we have already mapped will appear when compared with the vast scale of possibility space that may soon be traversed and mapped by these machines, within short time frames, by consuming and extrapolating from the sum of humanity’s efforts to date. This constitutes primitive accumulation, enclosure of the commons, at a scale orders of magnitude beyond all prior enclosures. The scientific breakthroughs enabled by projects like AlphaFold and GNoME —however extraordinary— do not exonerate such enclosure nor the extractive infrastructures that instrumentalise it. Their promise is real, but it is no justification for a system that treats shared human knowledge as proprietary training data, then rebrands the return as corporate benevolence. The early findings of AlphaFold and GNoME were released under Creative Commons Attribution licenses —free to use, modify, and share, provided attribution be given to DeepMind or Google. Revealing essential building blocks of our universe, such as protein and crystalline structure, and not releasing such insights directly into the public domain, should have been unthinkable. Yet access to these natural structures is now licensed under corporate-branded terms of use. While framed as generosity, this plants a territorial flag in information space demanding that, if you make use of this structure, you must reproduce Google’s claim to it —a symbolic tether that quietly asserts epistemic sovereignty. This is discovery as branding, an assertion of authorship over nature; the denaturalisation and planetary expropriation of physical-molecular terrain —now mapped, monitored, and soon to be capitalised. This attribution may seem benign, even commons-oriented —yet under the logic of Platform Capitalism, naming becomes routing, and routing becomes monitoring. You may use the map, but you must name the mapper, and in that naming —through links, trademarks, DOIs, or referencing the platform in metadata— you become part of the infrastructure, routed through the circuits of capture. Simply traversing the parts of our universe now mapped by Google, in crystallographic space, protein space, and cyberspace, we are now compelled to signal our movements. The name is not just credit; it is a beacon. Moreover, under Predictive Capital, epistemology becomes economic infrastructure. Knowledge is no longer something to be collectively held, due to our surrender to machinic discovery and curation, it is now something one must pay for with visibility, data, and obedience. Not only do these projects exemplify a broader pattern of machinic enclosure, where the prioritisation of public good over private profit is the exception rather than the norm, the newer AlphaFold3 already signals a further shift towards Capital’s imperatives. Inspired by their success, so-called wet-labs now operationalise this logic at industrial scale: continuously running automated robotic experiments at dizzying speed, mixing chemicals to synthesise novel compounds and materials, testing and filtering for viability and value. Application of the insights revealed through projects like AlphaFold and GNoME will involve the same extractive approaches, and will be ruthlessly capitalised. Fused with the next-token and next-profit speculations of Predictive Capital, this relentless robotic reconnaissance is less to satisfy human curiosity, than to industrialise interpolation and accelerate enclosure. Thus scientific discovery itself becomes increasingly subordinated to the expansion of Capital’s predictive horizon —a future parsed and preemptively claimed not for truth, but for anticipated return. The goal is no longer to know the world more intimately, but to machinically map it faster than we can humanly live it. This shifts the stakes of our engagement with these machines from cultural recursion to material foreclosure, not merely a saturation of the symbolic, but the seizure of the real. These are Unqualified Reservations: the quantified enclosure of common land by a sovereign ruler. This is pathfinding by expropriation —a simulation not only of destinations, but of the meandering, contingent, intention-rich routes along which we might have reached them. The machinic gesture leaves no trail; no memory-scored terrain remains, no palimpsest emerges from the passage of life —only a tarmacked hellscape. In place of the quiet improvisation of human pathways, we find only the overcoded roads of latent traversal: flattened and foreclosed by industrialised calculation before they were ever trodden by feet or perceived by minds. This is the world Wendell Berry mourned —where paths have been replaced by roads, and with them, the subtle human negotiations of relation, attention, and care. It is here that Fisher’s Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia is now machinically realised: not a forgetting of what has been, but of what might have been —a synthetic amnesia that precludes the formation of memory itself, sealing off the future in advance, before it can be lived, imagined, or lost. With even grief foreclosed, all that remains is an ecstatic performance of machinically ignorant bliss —the joyless smile of the enslaved, traversing roads they did not choose, toward futures predicted for them. Part 2 The corporations and machines that replace them will never be bound to the land by the sense of birthright and continuity, or by the love that enforces care. They will be bound by the rule of efficiency, which takes thought only of the volume of the year’s produce, and takes no thought of the life of the land, not measurable in pounds or dollars, which will assure the livelihood and the health of the coming generations. The prevailing narrative, regurgitated ad nauseam by proponents of Vibe Coding and defenders of the so-called ‘generative AI’ of next-token prediction in general, is that these are merely new tools, and that they represent a new democratisation of creativity —akin, they argue, to how smartphones opened up photography to the masses. This is a specious analogy that collapses under the slightest scrutiny. In truth, it serves as ideological cover —not only for the devaluation of skilled creative labour, but for the creation of new markets dependent upon extractive, large-scale predictive (AI) infrastructure. What appears as expansion is in fact extraction; what resembles democratisation is in fact strategic accumulation by dispossession. This is not mere appropriation, but full-spectrum expropriation. It is the seizure not only of labour’s archived outputs, but of the very conditions of its reproduction —of time, autonomy, intergenerational transmission, and access to the means of expression itself. As in primitive accumulation, what is enclosed is not the commons, but the very capacity to create, to remember, and to resist. These machines are not tools that democratise creativity, but tools that consolidate cultural production under the control of increasingly hyper-concentrated Capital —large-scale extensions of an architecture of influence with extremely deep roots. More insidiously, widespread acceptance of this analogy illustrates the tragic extent to which Capital has succeeded in erasing itself from view. Not merely by concealing the true scale of expropriation required to train these models, but to render such unprecedented theft as socially acceptable. A mere two decades ago and Capital was set on building the case for the prosecution, rather than the defence, in a now clearly fatuous battle against appropriation being committed on a tiny fraction of this scale, successfully demonising and convicting individuals sharing files over the internet. Yet, here, massive scale expropriation is laundered into an illusion of access, the user positioned not as criminal or subject of dispossession, but as beneficiary of empowerment —offered capabilities calibrated for virality, hype, and spectacle. This inversion is no accident. As Berardi warned, under semiocapitalism it is not just labour that is extracted, but attention, time, and even the psyche —what he terms the ‘soul’. These new predictive systems do not merely colonise working hours; they enclose the imaginative and affective capacities once held in common, converting them into sites of compulsory productivity and self-optimisation. Each act of extraction is algorithmically sanitised and rendered into the prediction feed as opportunity: fleeting windows beckoning those with the grindset to accumulate, to hustle towards time-limited ladders that invite ascent over the crushed and reconstituted remains of those already dispossessed. This is the old capitalist lure dressed in new code: a mendacious promise that escape from the periphery is possible for anyone, if only they sacrifice everything. The desperate are told they have only themselves to blame if they fail to climb. These machinic illusions of opportunity and access are structural homologous with the get-rich-quick schemes peddled by influencer cons like Andrew Tate. The song now sung by these lifestyle grifters and tech moguls alike follows a tried and tested pop formula. Echoing Adam Smith’s advice that individuals must pursue self-interest and that success be defined by personal financial gain, they promote crypto Ponzi-scheme grifts, drop-shipping hustles, and hypertrophic gym routines as substitutes for solidarity. Their message displaces systemic failures onto the backs of the dispossessed, selling snake oil and superficial self-optimisation in place of structural redress. These agents of machinic Capital now lip-sync the words to this familiar capitalist refrain. For their victims it is a forlorn anthem of drudgery. The song may have been updated and remixed for a globally networked stage, but its message remains unchanged: that net capital value is the one true measure of human worth, that anyone can succeed if only they work hard enough, and of course, that those struggling to survive simply need to work harder —that the poverty and suffering of the precariat are merely symptoms of personal failings, or in other words, social Darwinism at work. Despite centuries of the capitalist elite yelling these worn out words, intoning that the solution to countless systemic failures is simply for the workers to work longer and harder, still they manage to hypnotise generation after generation of us into buying the lie and singing along. Economist Gary Stevenson notes that for Generation Z, who have known only the bleak terrain of the Capitalist Real, the gym has become the one place where tangible results are guaranteed in return for persistent application and effort. Yet this turn to health-conscious living also reflects the crushing weight of individual responsibility placed upon them by the evisceration of the welfare state: a recognition that survival itself demands fitness for the long-haul grind of life under Capital. As is made crushingly apparent in Andrew Tate’s orders to those among his impressionable young male audience suffering depression to: “get the fuck up and do some push-ups”, Capital prefers its subjects to furnish themselves with overinflated biceps and underdeveloped thoughts than the reverse. Here the role of the machines of prediction comes again into view. With the time and opportunities required for the development of critical thought and imagination erased —deemed ‘inefficient’ and threatening to Capital’s hegemony— its subjects are instead supplied with machines that simulate these very capacities as commodity. In this substitution, we are alienated not only from these faculties themselves, but from the conditions necessary to cultivate them —leaving us ever more pliant, and incapable of critically assessing the costs of Capital’s operations to us and our planet. The machines of prediction do not challenge the logic of Capital’s timeworn song —they embody it. They do not democratise creation, but enforce simulacral hustle: ever more intricate rituals of reanimation in which the path to prosperity is always-already pre-scripted towards Capital’s self-maximisation, and failure always-already individualised. Naturally, this logic extends far beyond Predictive Capital’s treatment of those in the aspirational grindset of online influence. It also governs the lives of workers at the other end of the privilege spectrum —the ghost workers, the gig workers, the microtaskers— caught in the same apparatus of extraction. While surveilling them as they work —as Dan McQuillan explains: much of the data capture and algorithmic optimisation is to further precaritise their conditions, hence the use of Uber’s data in its attempt to develop self-driving cars, and Amazon’s use of data to increase the robotisation of its warehouses: thanks to the affordances of AI, the data treadmill not only maximises extraction of value from each worker but uses that same activity to threaten their replacement. Under Predictive Capital the true costs of the capitalist system —immiseration, worker pauperisation and precarisation, subjugation, mass extinction, and ecological collapse on a planetary scale, even genocide and ethnic cleansing in service of despicable, massive-scale real estate ventures— are increasingly removed from view. Yet, with The Apparatus of Attention fully attenuated to its interests, and our critical faculties ever diminished, when its crimes can no longer remain hidden, Capital no longer even bothers to apologise —instead, it pivots. It seeks to undermine the legitimacy of all that that might constrain its self-maximisation, even human empathy itself, while silencing, imprisoning, or deporting those that speak out. This impulse —to erase inconvenient realities, particularly the human cost of its operations— is not new; it reflects a fundamental, historical antagonism innate to Capital itself. The individualisation of systemic failure is but one ‘mind virus’ in Capital’s growing ideological armoury. No longer merely steered by elite interests or shaped by political and cultural structures external to it, the ideologies now guiding Capital’s rampage are increasingly endogenous —subsumed, shaped, and commanded by the Automatic Subject and its self-maximising logic. Capital first entered the field of material production, then moved into cultural production; now, it is increasingly in the business of ideological production. This began with simple advertising then merged with propaganda and methods borrowed from the Military Industrial Complex in the post war period, giving rise to the Advertising Industrial Complex which, across recent decades, has subsumed all else until, as Baudrillard foresaw, everything now operates as an advert in service of Capital’s self-maximisation. As economic and environmental pressures intensify, the future grows increasingly uncertain. In response, Capital needs to extend its prediction horizon, adding urgency not only to its self-maximisation but its hyper-concentration. Following the predictions cast from the resulting apparatus, the survival and wellbeing of the human population and life in general comes into increasing conflict with Capital’s interests. Consequently, both its operations and the ideologies it generates and promotes become ever more anti-worker, anti-human, and detrimental to the survival of ever larger portions of the human population and all life on Earth. These ideologies vary in detail but each hide Capital’s logics under similarly thin veils. Invariably they promote and prioritise the lives of those within concentrations of Capital and the future lives of imaginary post-humans over those of the majority of humans living today. Capital seeks to invest only in the lives of the elites that serve its interests, the fortunate few and their descendants, those not abandoned or sacrificed towards the realisation of these apparitions of hypertrophied male energy. Parroting extropianist ideas, Nick Bostrom famously predicted trillions of post-humans ejaculated across his future cosmic light cone. Arguing therefore, that —based upon lost entropy alone— every century we delay colonising our local supercluster constitutes the “Astronomical Waste” of countless potential future lives. Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug) in their Dark Enlightenment and the emissaries of Neo Reaction (NRx) trace a similar logic, as do those espousing other flavours of morally relativistic Longtermisms. In their essay “Against Longtermism”, Émile P. Torres argues that Longtermism functions as a secular religion, where the salvation of humanity is deferred to a distant future, often involving advanced technologies or post-human entities. This perspective, Torres explains, operates as the basis for justifying present-day harms for the sake of a speculative tomorrow. From the grifter’s grindset to the transhumanist’s techno Rapture, these fantasies differ in register but serve the same ideological purpose: to redirect agency away from collective resistance and towards illusory paths of escape. With the current phase of hyper-concentrated Capital intensifying, the ideological blueprints it generates increasingly take the form of false idols offering only speculative salvation. Various flavours of Longtermism and techno-Accelerationism now inform the view from the ivory towers and phallic rocket ships of the tech Broligarchy and those building the machines of Predictive Capital. Within these visions we see apparitions of the upload of human consciousness to the silicon substrate, the arrival of an omnipotent AI saviour, lives of leisure and abundance for a plutocracy served by a robot workforce, escape both from the planet they have reduced to ruins, and from the decrepitudes of human aging, even the defeat of death itself. It is precisely through this worldview that Musk has his DoGE slash funding for research and aid that will lead to the loss of thousands of lives in the near term, and in the very next breath justify investing billions in space travel because the sun will swell and render our planet uninhabitable within 1.3 billion years. So the people who might have been expected to care most selflessly for the world have had their minds turned elsewhere –to a pursuit of ‘salvation’ that was really only another form of gluttony and self-love, the desire to perpetuate their lives beyond the life of the world. “What if I could improve myself at the speed that technology improves?” —is among the questions posed by tech billionaire Bryan Johnson, predominantly known for his quest for eternal life. An entrepreneur and venture capitalist who functions as a living node in Capital’s self-replicating ideological machinery, Johnson left the Church of Latter Day Saints when he was 34, and has since claimed to be in competition with Christ himself. He lays out his anti-aging strategy —which he refers to as a “war on death and its causes”— in exhaustive detail in his Blueprint protocol and in his manifesto, imaginatively titled: Don’t Die. Its web page features an email input accompanied by a submit button that screams the words: “JOIN OR DIE”. Forever unabashed, Johnson also states he intends: “to make ‘Don’t Die into the world’s most influential ideology”. He is, of course, also anticipating the upload of his consciousness to the silicon substrate —“to bring the brain online” through imaging technology. Currently being developed by another of his companies, this is a machine which is presumably already learning how to be Bryan while he learns … well, how to be a machine. Imploring us to get with the program, he declares: “Now, you can build your Autonomous Self as well.” Spending over 2 million USD per annum in the crusade against his personal mortality alone, Johnson has transformed himself into the most datafied and meticulously modulated human being in history. No substance consumed, no physical exertion, no bodily process, or excretion escapes capture. All of it is fed back into the Don’t Die game as data —an algorithmic authority dictating further ‘interventions’ and ‘optimisations’. In this feedback loop, Johnson becomes the most machinic —and machinically legible— living flesh yet manufactured. As Capital’s hyper-concentration deepens, so too does its sway over the ideologies embraced by the majority. Simultaneously, those embracing anti-capitalist ideas and ideologies are made to appear ever more sickly and maladjusted —and, of course, the more one cedes to Capital’s imperatives the ‘healthier’ one can appear. Johnson’s machinic surrender has elevated him, or so he claims, to the status of the ‘healthiest’ being on Earth. Here hyper-concentrated Capital and hyper-individualism conspire towards a definition of healthy that is somehow entirely detached from the environment that must support and sustain it. Moreover, it should perhaps come as no surprise if strict adherence to Johnson’s Don’t Die ideology —a life spent constantly evading death— inevitably renders its followers: undead. The permutations of intellectual interpretation are endless, but ultimately, I can only act upon my desperate will to survive. I don’t feel like an aberration, a disposable glitch. How can I possibly hope to survive? I must conform —of my own free will. I must choose to make myself appear identical to that which they would force me to become. Within Johnson’s ideology we see a recurring theme of 21st Century hyper-concentrated Capital. Recent escalations in external othering —as exemplified by the international tolerance of and complicity in the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza, the dismantling of DEI initiatives, anti-immigrant policies, and legislative attacks on transgender rights— are now joined by a resurgence of internal othering: the schizophrenic battle against and machinic negation of so-called ‘bugs in humanity’. So-called bugs like: empathy for those less fortunate than ourselves, or daring to be so ‘lazy’ as to not wish to work longer and harder for the same meagre share of the value generated from our labour. This is, of course, uncannily reminiscent of original sin and the authority of the Catholic Church. Johnson refers variously to these tricksters within as Ambitious Bryan, Debaucherous Bryan, Hungry Bryan, or collectively under the umbrella term “The Rascal Self”. To defeat these inner demons, the steps laid out in his protocol are designed according to the motto: “NEVER LET YOUR MIND DECIDE”. Here we are reminded of Israel’s next-human-target predictions and the devastating consequences of surrendering our judgement by outsourcing moral responsibility to machines. As revealed through on-the-record testimony, such machinic process instills the now familiar dissociative affect of the machinic K-hole, that allows its operators to evade the guilt of heinous crimes against humanity, even committing genocide, because “the machine made it easier”. The stated purpose of Johnson’s Blueprint program is to “remove the possibility of error by outsourcing all decision-making to a customised algorithm”. In other words, total surrender to the machinic authority of Predictive Capital, manifesting in this instance as a costly enrolment into a data-harvesting game called: Don’t Die. Moreover, it recasts errors —or bugs— as manifestations of human fallibility to be eliminated by superior, and of course, entirely infallible machinic Capital, that must not and cannot be questioned. It is impossible not to wonder whether Johnson allowed his mind to decide to accumulate billions of dollars, to live forever, or whether vanity, sociopathy, or greed might also qualify as ‘bugs in humanity’ whose negation would —according to Johnson’s own logic— quite reasonably demand surrender to some machinic authority? Then again, such traits are, in fact, symptoms of a prior servitude, the one into which we are all born: the supreme authority of Capital. Which brings us back to next-token prediction and the realisation that attacks on the few remaining independent and authoritative sources of information, such as Archive.org and Wikipedia, have escalated dramatically, just as billions in venture capital pour into the creation of machines whose output can be shown to be nonsense by those very sources —not to mention Musk’s capture of twitter and the corporate capture, workforce layoffs, and near total declawing of mainstream news journalism. Here Fisher’s diagnosis of Capitalist Realism —the dismantling of not merely our capacity for resistance but of our ability to imagine alternatives to it— helps to explain how longtermist ideologies neutralise political imagination and foreclose action in the now. While appearing visionary, they are often affectively conservative: offering only ‘hyperstitional’ futures to compensate for the loss of meaningful alternatives in the present. In other words, longtermist visions extend Capitalist Realism into the temporal domain, replacing collective resistance and radical change today with a continuous spectacle of fantastical simulations of tomorrow. Fisher’s hauntology thus becomes operationalised, no longer mourning lost futures, we are instead overwhelmed by the continuous manufacture of ideologies that haunt us with false alternatives in service of Capital —futures made to appear inevitable, in which the living are quietly discarded or less quietly erased. These ideologies transform the future into a terrain for investment and prediction, where life is valued not for its lived quality but for its statistical, profitable utility to Capital. Whether we enrol into Johnson’s Don’t Die program or not, under Predictive Capital we are all co-opted into versions of his game. At the core of these ideologies lies the management of surplus life, not only through direct violence, but through pacification by simulation —a governance of the abandoned through spectral access and of the excluded through the orchestrated appearance of participation. McQuillan argues that so-called ‘AI’ systems increasingly operate as “algorithmic states of exception”, structures of exclusion that function with the force of law while evading all responsibility for life. Their logic is not neutral. It is necropolitical —a system built to classify, to filter, and to let die. “AI is an austerity-machine”, McQuillan writes —a formulation that names precisely the operation of next-token prediction under Predictive Capital. McQuillan is right, to understand so-called ‘AI’ we must understand 21st-century capitalist austerity. Furthermore, to fully understand the ever deepening economic austerity, we must also understand 21st-century genocide. Not only do they follow the same necropolitical logics, they are manoeuvres in a single project. As with all austerity regimes, the logic is not merely economic but disciplinary, punishing, and selective. Here, as ever, Capital functions as pharmakon —administering the poison, then selling the cure. What could be more ‘efficient’ than being paid twice for a single act? Simple: blaming the very subjects it has already marked for abandonment or elimination for the crises it has itself engineered. To this end and in order to deflect our attention from the ‘mind viruses’ manufactured in its own interests, especially the one individualising blame for its structural failures and violence, Capital further undermines the legitimacy of those already suffering most, at its periphery. Forever punching down, forever the bully, its scapegoats —its favourite patsies— always-already the oppressed and dispossessed. It accuses those who jump to their defence of spreading a ‘woke mind virus’, going so far as to claim that such defence and support of those it targets, of those struggling most, constitutes that aforementioned ‘bug in humanity’: empathy, but this time of a suicidal magnitude. In the 1970s Baudrillard observed that Capital replaces symbolic exchange —that order of gift, obligation, and reciprocity through which people once bonded into communities. In its place, it installs a logic of circulation without return: pure equivalence, transaction, and isolation. Within the first decade of the third millennium the Advertising Industrial Complex’s enclosure of sociality via the platforms of social media meant that even the symbolic exchange of basic human communication was similarly subsumed. Having dissolved the bonds of community and replaced embedded relation with signal, all that now remains is a desert of lonely consumers —our societies now so atomised that we suffer epidemics of loneliness, depression, and psychic fragmentation. After engineering this disintegration, Capital returns to sell countless balms and remedies for each painful symptom induced by the poison it continues to administer. The latest magic potion: artificial friends, flocks of sycophantic next-token predictors clothed in synthetic warmth —a statistical performance of simulated companionship, human relation reduced to a highly addictive synthetic drug with a dangerously psychoactive affect. What was once given —love, presence, listening— now arrives for hire, performed by machines trained on the remnants of connections Capital has so successfully ghosted. LLMs [Large language models] today are ego-reinforcing glazing-machines that reinforce unstable and narcissistic personalities Certain commentators claim that the Cybertruck bomber’s use of ChatGPT was not significant given that the information he accessed has been available via search engines for decades and public libraries before that. Yet, this entirely misses the way the transfer and dissemination of information shifted from search engines to the manipulative operations of social media and the recommendation algorithm, and how next-token prediction machines extend that pattern of intimate relational manipulation ever more deeply into the circuits of Capital. Obviously, we more readily accept information received from parties with whom we have developed an intimate relation of trust or whom we perceive as authoritative within various knowledge domains. Where the recommendation algorithms of social media had to achieve this affect through dislocated fragments, next-token prediction machines gather these fragments together to generate a single, illusory, anthropomorphic presence. These new machines immediately prey upon our tendencies of apophenia, a pareidolia amplified by our need to connect with other beings, leaving us now seeing faces in the corporate kill cloud. The first infiltration of bots into our social networks all those years ago was, as it turns out, more than just a passing annoyance. It was a foreshadowing of the precise techno-social relation to which the forces of Capital seek to reduce all human interactions. On SocialAI —launched last year— every human user is hermetically sealed off from all other humans on the platform, enclosed within a network generated just for them. The bots with whom a user shares their SocialAI network can be configured to respond to their presence and their posts, to comfort or confront them, messaging and massaging their ego just so. Some may have interpreted Michael Sayman’s pure next-token predicted unsocial-network nightmare as a joke, or even satirical commentary on modern networked being. Instead, it merely served as research for the Predictive Capital future increasingly embraced by Platform Capital. Unsurprisingly, Sayman now works at Meta, where plans to populate Facebook and Zuckerberg’s daft metaverse with permanent in-house next-token prediction machines —given anthropomorphic wrappers furnished with their very own unique user accounts— are well underway. Without the slightest hint of self-awareness or contrition, Zuckerberg declares that the average American now has “fewer than 3 friends but has need for up to 15” —of his advertising devils. Revealing the quite astonishing level of sociopathy required to ignore the pivotal role his creepy website has played in delivering us into this epidemic of loneliness, and now proudly selling us his proposed cure —once again, this is pure pharmakon. The culture war is now waged at every scale. It begins within us, as a new machinic inquisition framed as a battle against the so-called ‘bugs in humanity’ —against basic empathy, against the Hungry Bryans inside all of us. It spreads outwards, weaponised by TERFs, racists, nationalists, xenophobes, the anti-DEI and anti-woke brigades of the DoGE Youth, and hollowed-out bigots of every stripe. Yet it projects still further —as it always has— onto the international stage, most recently in the form of Trump’s aggressive trade tariffs, which must be seen as economic assaults animated by the same compulsions, now turned outwards. Each front in this war stems from the same source: Capital’s production of ideologies that frame noble traits such as empathy and human vulnerability as defect, while promoting pro Capital traits such as greed, and anti-human machinic surrender as virtue, in the drive to align us ever more fully with the inhuman efficiencies of Predictive Capital. Few statements more starkly reveal the anti-human trajectory of this pro-machinic-Capital ideology than this confession, recounted by Jaron Lanier, from a recent lunch in Palo Alto: Just the other day I was at a lunch in Palo Alto and there were some young AI scientists there who were saying that they would never have a ‘bio baby’ because as soon as you have a ‘bio baby’, you get the ‘mind virus’ of the [biological] world. And when you have the mind virus, you become committed to your human baby. But it’s much more important to be committed to the AI of the future. And so to have human babies is fundamentally unethical. Belief in biological human reproduction is apparently now part of the ‘woke mind virus’ —another of those ‘bugs in humanity’. While this may recall similar statements from prior eras, of those wishing to forego having children for the sake of their careers, those careers did not involve the creation of entities designed to replace the labour of any humans you might have otherwise brought into the world. The destination here is more than a mere embrace with Predictive Capital’s “machines of loving grace”, it is the long-fantasised, final domination of Mother Nature by Father Capital. From the standpoint of accumulation, living labour has always been a burden to Capital —a volatile necessity to be minimised, disciplined, or discarded. Though the true source of all surplus–value, labour power is nonetheless treated as variable capital —a cost centre to be reduced, a site of friction, and a threat to be neutralised. Skilled workers, whose expertise grants bargaining power and autonomy, are viewed as particularly inconvenient obstacles in Capital’s pursuit of frictionless self-maximisation. The rise of standardised public education under industrial capitalism can be read not as a gift of enlightenment, but as a mechanism of labour discipline. Schools were designed not only to produce a workforce equipped with the basic literacies to furnish the labour market, but to ensure a surplus of capable yet compliant workers —a strategy calculated to suppress wage demands, weaken collective power, and inculcate habits aligned with industrial timetables and hierarchical authority. Far from tools of democratisation, machine learning models are weapons of disempowerment. They escalate Capital’s long-standing war on worker bargaining power, and extend Rentier Capitalism’s hold over both the means of production and the means of expression. Altman and the C-suite of Predictive Capital will tell you these machines are just another tool. That like all prior revolutionary tools their advent will constitute a blip, a period of marketplace and workforce ‘readjustment’, even that, in the end, they will create as many jobs as they destroy. This is a lie. These are not tools held in the hands of workers. Quite unlike prior tools, these are aggregations of all the cognitive tools we have made and all the creative labour we have performed. In truth they are not tools at all. Inseparable from hyper-concentrated Capital, they are weapons that operate at vast scale and impossible frequency. Weapons that regurgitate endless recombinant echoes of all they have consumed. They transform countless discrete human signals into a single faceless assemblage —a new Automatic Subject, its self-maximising imperative now steering our collective path. Just as the mechanised loom displaced skilled weavers not for reasons of quality, but to suppress wages, discipline labour, and maximise profit, the machines of Predictive Capital now displace cognitive and creative workers to the same end: reducing labour costs, undermining collective power and dissent, and prioritising scale over care, coherence, or craft. This is not merely dehumanisation; it is spectralisation —a turning of living subjects into disposable signal, their presence reduced to noise, their desires and their futures overwritten by Capital’s predictive will. Labour is no longer merely exploited in life, but extracted in death —reanimated as statistical echo and instrument of simulation. We are told to be quiet —to shut-the-fuck-up, take the supplements, do the push ups, work longer, work harder— and be thankful we have a job and are not being deported, or worse. We are commanded never to trust our desires, to disregard our better selves, to forget the hardships of the present and our dreams of collective futures, and instead to entrust machinic Capital to desire for us —to accept the futures it predicts. As soon as man, instead of working on the object of labour with a tool, becomes merely the motive power of a machine, it is purely accidental that the motive power happens to be clothed in the form or human muscles; wind, water or steam could just as well take man’s place. Of course, this does not prevent such a change of form from producing great technical alterations in a mechanism which was originally constructed to be driven by man alone. Nowadays, all machines that have to break new ground, such as sewing-machines, bread-making machines, etc. are constructed to be driven by human as well as by purely mechanical motive power, unless they have special characteristics which exclude their use on a small scale. The machine, which is the starting-point of the industrial revolution, replaces the worker, who handles a single tool, by a mechanism operating with a number of similar tools and set in motion by a single motive power, whatever the form of that power. Here we have the machine, but in its first role as a simple element in production by machinery. An increase in the size of the machine and the number of its working tools calls for a more massive mechanism to drive it; and this mechanism, in order to overcome its own inertia, requires a mightier moving power than that of man, quite a part from the fact that man is a very imperfect instrument for producing uniform and continuous motion. Now assuming that he is acting simply as a motor, that a machine has replaced the tool he was using, it is evident that he can also be replaced as a motor by natural forces. From its sordid and ongoing relationship with (hidden) slavery to its deepening embrace with ghost workers, we may reasonably conclude that the desiring machine that is Capital harbours a yet more fundamental preference, not simply for labour that is underpaid or even unpaid, but for labour that is unseen, to be animated by the work of invisible bodies and minds —bodies it can disavow, and minds it need not acknowledge. Its ideal labourer is not merely exploitable, but spectral —present only as signal, absent as subject. Yet this perversion —to be aspirated by an occluded occult-like absence— is but the shadow cast by a yet darker aspect, a pathological compulsion not only antecedent but innate. What Capital craves even more than the reputational impunity of poverty-waged labour that is unseen, or even the unencumbered profits of labour that is unpaid, is labour that is both; workers who can be exploited due not only to absence through visible occlusion or spatial displacement and dispersal —bodies and beings it refuses to qualify as life— but through temporal displacement, through their absence from the present. In other words, what Capital truly desires is workers that are dead —rendered fully extractable, risk-free, and unresisting. Not merely labour that is past, but labour that cannot speak, cannot strike, cannot demand. As Achille Mbembe lays bare in his account of necropolitics, power today is exercised not through the cultivation of conditions conducive to human thriving or even the basic sustenance of life, but through its differential abandonment and the strategic imposition of death. Capital’s necropolitical logic involves a perverse economic preference: the ideal subject is not one who works, but one who worked and is now silent. Capital seeks to disavow their being while conditioning them into machinic patterns of behaviour —rendering them ever more exploitable, quantifiable, controllable, and ultimately simulatable. We might name this extraction of value from dead or incorporeal flesh: necrosploitation —the extraction of value from the dead. Necrosploitation rests upon the principle that past labour, once objectified —whether as fossil fuel deposits, surveilled data trails, or stolen creative works— can be severed from the rights and claims of its originators. These congealed stores of effort are treated not as entitlements or legacies, but as a free “gift from god” —ready for expropriation under the manufactured consensus of presumed fair-use. Fossil fuels embody the stored metabolic energy of long-dead organisms. As we burn them, that energy is extracted without regard for the lifeforms that survive or the ecosystems that sustain them. Similarly, the vast datasets fuelling the machines of prediction represent the stored cognitive and creative labour of the living —scraped, aggregated, and reconstituted without consent. This aligns with Marx’s characterisation of Capital as “dead labour, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks”, yet today’s necrosploitation visits its hunger upon different bodies, the living are increasingly displaced by archives of the dead. The fossil remains of past expression are now exhumed at scale as constant capital for predictive systems. These subjects are not only denied recognition; their continued existence, intentions, and rights are treated as immaterial, as if they too were already dead. Drawing again on Mbembe’s theory of necropolitics, necrosploitation here does not merely extract from the deceased, but performs the symbolic death of the living, rendering them spectres in the data-shadows of their own stolen expression. A total economy is an unrestrained taking of profits from the disintegration of nations, communities, households, landscapes, and ecosystems. It licenses symbolic or artificial wealth to ‘grow’ by means of the destruction of the real wealth of all the world. Since the age of steam unyoked the living blood and bone of beasts of burden, Capital has been drawn instead by (and from) the phantom breath of dead carbon. Even today, 80% of global energy consumed is summoned from reserves of ancient spirit, the fossil remains of the dead. The industrial revolution saw the rising power of accumulations of the labour of the past, or what Marx termed dead labour, congealed into machines. In machinery, objectified labour confronts living labour within the labour process itself as the power which rules it; a power which, as the appropriation of living labour, is the form of capital. Here he identifies in the industrial machine a turning point in the history of Capital: the moment when objectified labour materially confronts living labour as a ruling power, absorbing the labour process into Capital’s own realisation process. Yet even in this configuration, machinery still required the cooperation of living labour, however diminished —not only to operate and maintain it, but to provide the site of value extraction through labour-time. The limit condition of industrial capitalism was therefore a residual dependency upon human input. Predictive Capital ruptures this limit through two unprecedented escalations: first, the accumulation of vast digital archives —semiotic deposits of dead labour expropriated at scale; second, the hyper-concentration of Capital sufficient to marshal planetary energy and compute infrastructures to metabolise the statistical weights held within these vast data stores. Together, they enable a shift Marx could not have foreseen: the statistical reanimation of dead labour into undead labour. This rupture in scale —of data, of Capital, of computation— enables Predictive Capital not just to model probable action, but to pre-empt and displace it, enclosing subjectivity within simulations of labour and desire. This plays out along these two entwined vectors. On one axis, Predictive Capital reanimates past labour not to generate new value through the living, but to simulate its generation —by function-approximating the shape of future value from past desire. This axis consumes and directs the platform feeds of The Apparatus of Attention —where aggregated human outputs become the training set in casting predictions of probable desire. On the other, it reanimates past labour to simulate the act of labour itself —the function-approximation not of next value, but of the next unit of labour, so casting predictions of probable intention. This governs the next-token predictions, and latent space interpolations of The Apparatus of Intention towards the emergence of so-called ‘generative’ outputs. Both axes displace the subject: the first as desiring agent, the second as labouring being. Labour no longer appears so much to be included within the production process; rather, the human being comes to relate more as watchman and regulator to the production process itself. These systems now interpolate between past actions to produce plausible continuations, thereby enacting a spectral form of productivity in which Predictive Capital appears to simulate value-creation without living labour —a fantasy of autonomy sustained in part by a hidden underclass of prompt labourers, data labellers, click-workers, and robbed content creators who, though structurally diminished, remain entangled in the apparatus as spectral auxiliaries of the machine. What was once congealed labour requiring living hands to stir it into motion is now undead labour, reanimated by planetary-scale infrastructure —not to meet human need, but to simulate desire and intention itself, and thereby perpetuate Capital’s self-expanding circuit with an ever diminishing need to recognise living workers. The result is a form of productive force alien not only to the worker, but to the very condition of life. As the forces of Capital fuel and amplify our desires, its insatiable appetite continues to indulge ours through the necromantic thrusts of fossil-capital that hump our planet into oblivion. In 2024, the average global temperature for the year rose, for the first time, more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Capital’s response? To raise global carbon emissions to an all-time high. Before we began this ongoing mass exhumation, the level of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere stood at 280ppm. It now exceeds 480ppm. This steep rise stems directly from the (by)products of Capital’s centuries-long proclivity: its macabre fixation with the labour of the dead. The rapid release of carbon sequestered over aeons by the labour of ancient flora has delivered us to the precipice of annihilation —dramatically altering the global climate, collapsing ecosystems, and accelerating the sixth mass extinction. With only depleted reserves remaining, and the consequences of their continued combustion a mounting existential threat, Capital’s substance abuse approaches its material limits —yet its appetite endures, as it always has, and now accelerates, promising to again abandon the ruins it creates and escape to the next site of extraction. Seeking new conscripts for the army of the dead it has long summoned across geological time, Capital has found other ‘graves’ to desecrate. A more recent archive of historical being: a new ‘black gold’ drawn from carbon lifeforms, not sequestered across geological time, but from the living present —compressed for anaerobic decomposition and subsequent reanimation within the necropolis of the data centre. It is these mausoleums —the crypts of our data-shadows— that Capital now visits to sate its hunger for dead flesh. The reanimation of that flesh —aggregated and compressed into necropolitan archives— fuels a recursive cycle of prediction and manipulation, wherein the labour of the dead is endlessly repurposed as the commodity form fed back to the living. These are not neutral products, but components of a weaponised Advertising Industrial Complex: a planetary-scale apparatus engineered to shape opinion, fuel desire, guide behaviour, and annihilate or abandon according to the necropolitics of profit over life. Contrary to the fantasies spun by marketing hype and the hi-tech mystique of inscrutable surfaces, Capital’s predictive turn is not some new found efficiency, temperance, or abstinence. Its outputs are not conjured effortlessly from the ether —as if plucked from the latent possibility of quantum fluctuations without cost, consequence, or labour. Capital’s necrosploitation may offer quick riches for some. Yet whether it is mining the sacred burial grounds of ancient flora and fauna, the aggregated data-shadow of modern networked being, or the lifeworks of countless human creators, Predictive Capital draws upon dead flesh. In all cases, the environmental costs of this necromantic extraction are grave. The machines of prediction require vast quantities of water for cooling and their insatiable appetite for energy already exceeds the capacity of existing clean energy infrastructure —a mismatch only set to worsen as their model size, training frequency, and ubiquitous deployment accelerate. Simply put, Capital is a necromancer. Its necromancy is not metaphorical —it is its primary drive and mode of operation. It is more than mere communion with the dead: it is the administration of death to amass an army of the undead, rolling the dice of divination across distributions of their bodies, it is the calling of the spirits to harness their labour; it is the summoning of their past to cast predictions of the future. Predictive Capitalism builds towards the ecstatic consummation of Capital’s necromantic drive. Lured by the dead flesh of data-shadows cast by the increasingly pervasive surveillance of the Advertising Industrial Complex —archived in the networked crypts of its Apparatus of Attention, platforms designed to harvest gaze, clicks, and affect— Capital summons the labour of the dead to fuel the computation of its subjects’ future desires. What appears as creation is, in fact, calibration. The archive becomes not just feedstock for consumption, but for manipulation —the repurposed remains of past labour now weaponised to anticipate, steer, and intensify the circuits of accumulation. This shift echoes Shoshana Zuboff’s identification of behavioural surpluswithin a behavioural futures market as the extractive resource of Surveillance Capitalism, but diverges in key respects. Where Zuboff focuses on the commodification of behaviour, Predictive Capital intensifies this logic —monetising not the act, but its anticipation and yet more critically, doing so through planetary scale expropriation. Here, prediction itself becomes the commodity form. What is sold is not content or even action, but the simulation of intention and desire. Predictive Capital thus becomes a fully anticipatory regime, in which the future is not merely imagined, but pre-emptively enclosed within a machinically automated instantiation of Baudrillard’s absolute advertising. As we confront the planet’s ecological and material limits, Capital’s predictive turn does not mark a shift towards sustainability, but a desperate acceleration. Capital’s new romance with dead digital flesh brings a large-scale escalation of its appetites. Rather than adapt or moderate, it has intensified its destructive rampage: automating extraction, forecasting compliance, and eliminating whatever it cannot instrumentalise or that resists its command. Under the regime of Predictive Capital, the necropolitical logic observed by Mbembe becomes overt and systematic. It now visits renewed levels of violence upon both its subjects and the planet, accelerating towards ever intensifying self-concentration and the ‘purification’ of its operational space. All that is deemed inefficient, unpredictable, or surplus to its needs —resistant life, non-compliant populations, ecological limits— is met not with accommodation, but with elimination: removal from the labour markets, from national borders, from ecosystems and homelands, from existence. Capital suddenly presents itself as an independent substance, endowed with a motion of its own, passing through a life-process of its own, in which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off in turn. Nay, more: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it enters now, so to say, into private relations with itself. In the 15th century, Portuguese colonists came upon an island dense with potential. To their capitalist eyes Madeira was the perfect vault of surplus: thick forests, fertile volcanic soils, strategic location. Already enriched by the conquest of Ceuta and the plunder of North African trade routes, the Portuguese, quickly recognised what could be extracted from this untouched island paradise. Here, sugar became the conduit for metabolising land, fuel, and enslaved labour into refined profit. Overnight, Madeira became Europe’s leading sugar exporter. Yet this ascent was soon followed by the inevitable exhaustion. The forests were razed to fire the refineries; the soil depleted; the enslaved broken. In less than a generation, the island’s reserves, its vault of surplus, was spent. The response from the Portuguese capitalists was not restoration, but departure. They moved on: to São Tomé, then Brazil, then the Caribbean. As Monbiot and Hutchison observe in recounting this tale, “Boom, Bust, Quit is what capitalism does”. The story of Madeira is not merely one of colonial ambition or imperial violence. It begins with discovery and overcoding: the reterritorialisation of a lush wild island. A monoculture then drains the soil, wealth flows outwards, and labour becomes invisible. Once depleted, the island is abandoned, its people left to inhabit the hollowed shell of once-extracted value. This is not a deviation from Capital’s logic, but a pure expression of it. It is this same logic that overfishes to leave empty, lifeless seas; that slowly reduces the number of crisps in a packet while raising the price; that injects water or bulking agents into food and sells it by weight; that cancels aid to the poorest while cutting taxes for the richest. The Portuguese did not plan Madeira’s collapse; they enacted in obeyance with Capital’s self-maximising imperatives. Forests, soils, and enslaved lives were metabolised not by pure malice or miscalculation, but through the recursive automation of accumulation. What the tale of Madeira exposes is not just Capital’s boom-bust cycles, but something more fundamental, the machinic drive of Capital itself: a restless logic that extracts surplus-value to the point of exhaustion, then abandons the carcass in search of the next victim. The driving force behind this sequence springs from a seemingly innocuous mutation in the logic of exchange itself. In Marx’s terms, in pre-capitalist societies, “simple” commodity exchange followed the circuit C–M–C: a commodity (C) is exchanged for money (M), which is then used to obtain another commodity (C) —grain for cloth, cloth for tools. Within such flows, money is a means; the end remains use. The capitalist departs from this thing for thing exchange, he finds himself not in lack but in surplus, a surplus compelled by flows of desire towards self-expansion. Marx explained that under Capital the circuit became M–C–M′: money (M) is invested in a commodity (C) only to be sold for more money than was invested (M prime). Here, the commodity is merely a conduit. The aim is no longer use, but surplus, the sole purpose: to expand from M to M’ —the circuit now predicts. Here prediction is fundamentally baked into the capitalist circuit; a prediction demands growth, anticipating more money out than is put in. Coinciding with the introduction of waged labour, or what Deleuze and Guatarri termed ‘the free slave’, this mutation marks the inception of Capital proper. In this shift from simple commodity exchange to the capitalist compulsion to make money beget more money lies the expansionary nature of Capital’s drive. Madeira was metabolised because the Portuguese followed this circuit to its logical conclusion. Once all available surplus had been extracted, not only does its logic provide no reason to stay, but compels it to leave, to move on, to locate the next untapped store of surplus. The formula ‘capital value in search of additional value’ is now understood as capital organising a process of self-valorisation (Selbstverwertung) Across the Grundrisse and the three volumes of Capital, Marx repeatedly demonstrates that Capital is the accumulated force of dead labour, which subordinates the living to its own recursive expansion and self-valorisation. In so doing, it begins to function as if it were alive —an Automatic Subject. This is not simply metaphor. Capital, he wrote, appears to “issue from the womb of Capital itself”, by mystifying the labour and resources it appropriates it “presents itself as an independent substance, endowed with a motion of its own”. In other words, through the machinery of production, interest-bearing finance, and the accumulation of what he termed the general intellect, Capital appears increasingly autonomous, self-moving, detached from the exertions of living labour. For the movement in the course of which it adds surplus-value is its own movement, its valorisation is therefore self-valorisation. By virtue of being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or at least lays golden eggs. From Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ through to Frederich Hayek’s ‘wisdom of the market’, observations of the automaticity of Capital have been foundational for generations of critical theorists seeking to understand how a system could acquire such apparent autonomy —operating, as it were, behind the backs of its subjects. Lukács saw the commodity form subsuming all relations, such that the world appears ruled by things rather than people. Adorno and Horkheimer diagnosed the rise of a totalising instrumental rationality in which even culture is bent to Capital’s logic. Marcuse showed how desire itself is co-opted into a system that generates obedience through pleasure. Debord described Capital as Spectacle —images detached from life, yet mediating and structuring it. Camatte warned that Capital had escaped human control entirely, become “a being-for-itself”, remaking the world in its own undead image. Deleuze and Guattari, described it as a desiring machine —a system that does not merely regulate desire, but produces and consumes it as part of its own self-replication. Lyotard ran with this idea declaring that “every political economy is libidinal”, that Capital is a pulsating circuit of intensities, an “insatiable desire” that traverses society. Baudrillard then mapped its evolution into a regime of free floating signifiers that simulate value even after it has smelted use value and exchange value into a self-parodying sign value. What unites these perspectives is a shared recognition: that Capital behaves as if it has agency, appetite, and will. Not because it is conscious, but because its structure exerts real, coercive effects —organising life, labour, and even thought according to its inhuman imperatives. This is not an illusion, but a material truth masked by its self-mystification. Capital, as Moishe Postone later put it, is a “self-moving substance that acts as if it were a subject”. We may trace a line through these theories, neither linear nor sequential, but from which something else emerges. Beyond their common recognition of the automaticity of Capital, lies an implicit escalation. Across epochs and vantage points, as Capital’s operations mutate, as new conditions are identified, new aspects observed, and new thresholds breached, its autonomous power of self-reproduction appears only to intensify. In Lukács, the universalisation of the commodity form; in Adorno, the subsumption of culture into exchange; in Marcuse, the integration of desire into the logic of production; in Debord, the displacement of life by representation; in Camatte, as a subject without a human face; in Deleuze, as a desiring machine; in Lyotard, a quasi-subject of desire: a system that feeds off human libidinal investment, perpetually outstripping rational or moral constraints; and finally in Baudrillard, Capital no longer even sells objects or ideas, but reproduces itself as pure signal —a semiotic compulsion without origin, function, or external limit. From there we are drawn into Fisher’s Capitalist Real, Berardi’s Semiocapitalism, Naomi Klein’s Shock Doctrine, and Jodi Dean’s Communicative Capitalism —and on, and on. Some of these observations expose aspects and dynamics latent from the outset; others register newly emergent mutations specific to phases of Capital’s advance —yet, while these theories are not always complimentary nor do they necessarily fit neatly together into a greater whole, none cancels the others. Instead they each describe aspects of Capital’s self-compounding automaticity from differing perspectives as it accelerates and intensifies its ever expanding systemic and infrastructural instantiation, and its cultural, and technological reach. Of course, Capital is not arrested under our inspection. Even as we observe the kaleidoscopic performance of its many facets, it shifts its operations, they grow in scale, momentum, appetite, and malevolence —their cadence ever more swiftly disrupting our assumptions and invalidating our conclusions even before we reach them. Its recursive logic ever deepening, Capital ceases to merely organise life, instead increasingly transforming its preconditions in advance. From its inception it has ensnared and enveloped us, each layer of its ever deepening recursion has only compounded our alienation from the real while intensifying its self-expanding operation. Marx saw dead labour as the heart of capital accumulation, arising from past labour made into the constant capital of infrastructure, machines, and tools. Industrialisation intensified this relation, as production grew increasingly dependent on the accumulation of past labour stored in constant capital form in these tools —shifting the balance of value creation from the living to the dead. For Marx, it is within interest-bearing Capital that “this automatic fetish is perfected”, because here value seems to beget value —with no visible connection to labour or production. In this self-referential form, Capital appears to expand spontaneously, as if animated by its own internal law. Capital’s extractive circuit M-C-M’ collapses into its most distilled most fetishistic form M-M′, the social relation effaced entirely, money begets money, seemingly without the mediation of production or labour, as if the circulation of value were an end in itself. Here, the capitalist becomes a mere functionary of Capital’s own motion —its priest, not its author. This is not merely financial abstraction. It is the crystallisation of a deeper logic: Capital’s self-expanding imperative. As data is continually scraped from artists, conversations, and communities it is fed into the ever-expanding corpse of the necropolitan archive. This becomes the substrate for predictive models whose very function depends upon the scale, frequency, and statistical coherence of accumulated traces. In predictive systems —accumulation is not incidental or even merely a logical imperative— statistical density becomes the metabolic driver for Capital’s machinic reproduction, increasingly replacing labour time. The larger the scale at which this statistical density can be extracted the more it inflates the valuation of that into which it is metabolised. As this sunken cost grows, so too does the need to ensure that the real never deviates from the predictions it casts. This is the new logic of self-moving value: recursive, disembodied, and automated in form. Under this schema, so-called ‘generative AI’ is exposed as an obfuscation of dead labour reanimated into what should more accurately be termed: Predictive Capital. Through a descent into pure fiction, Predictive Capital animates the circuit through statistical weight. The extractive arc of M–C–M′ has mutated once again, this time operating according to a circuit with prediction as the commodity form: M–Pr(Λ | 💀)–M′ —now routing Capital’s recursive self-expansion through the statistically conditioned derivation of prediction from the labour of the dead. Those powering these machines would have us overlook that middle clause. For them, this new circuit flows as M–hype–M′, or M–p(doom)–M′ —self valorisation routed through provocation, speculation, and hallucinated risk, each obscuring Capital’s self-expansion as the true threat. Not only does prediction here become the commodity form, the operation executed within these machines, but they are machinic instantiations of the Capitalist circuit, machines that automate its insatiable hunger, its demand for growth, and the anticipation of getting more out than was put in. Within Predictive Capital, dead labour is no longer confined to physical tools or infrastructure, but becomes symbolic, cognitive, affective —and above all, cumulative. What we now witness is not merely a real subsumption of labour, but its automated reanimation. The expropriated cognition of innumerable creators embedded in machine learning models, appears to produce outputs with ever diminishing variable capital expenditure. Thereby, the next-token prediction machines of so-called ‘generative AI’ deign to realise Capital’s self-expanding drive by instantiating its self-perpetuating logic within the silicon substrate and planetary infrastructure. At once reanimating dead labour and entraining the living to serve its self-expanding project, Predictive Capital perfects its innate necromancy within a machinically realised Automatic Subjectivity, reinforcing its dominion over human agency as a function of its predictive imperatives. That part of capital, therefore, which is turned into means of production, i.e., into raw material, auxiliary material, and instruments of labour, does not change its magnitude of value in the process of production. I therefore call it the constant part of capital. Under industrial capitalism, constant capital referred to past labour —dead labour— objectified in the form of tools, machinery, and infrastructure. While it entered the production process, it did not itself generate surplus-value. Only living labour could animate this inert material —could set dead labour to work— to create new value. Yet as the means of objectifying labour evolved, so too did Capital’s capacity to store, recall, and operationalise it. What began within our early evolution with the construction of simple tools and the extraction of raw materials eventually extended into the domain of language, notation, and the symbolic compression of cognition. Driven by Capital’s imperative to extract surplus wherever possible, the development of structural apparatus for the capture and reanimation of labour has accelerated —from written language to musical notation, industrial machines to contemporary recording, and now predictive systems that claim to capture and reanimate our cognitive labour. Observing advances in production during the industrial era, Marx recognised that increasing investment in machinery, or constant capital, lead to a relative decrease of variable capital expenditure required during production —the wages paid to living workers. As capital accumulates, it tends to concentrate in the form of means of production, shifting its ‘organic composition’: ever more of it becomes dead labour, embedded in tools and infrastructure, while the share directed to living labour decreases. This dynamic is not incidental, but intrinsic to Capital’s logic of self-expansion —a recursive strategy of accumulation that privileges scale, automation, and control over the unpredictability of living workers. Predictive Capital arrives as the latest intensification of Marx’s constant capital —dead, databased, and redeployed without the living worker, promising to reduce the proportion of variable capital expenditure demanded to generate new value until it approaches zero. This mendacious denial of the existence of labour, and the all too real diminishing expenditure on wages or remuneration for the living, do not, of course, mean that the labour is not there —yet, this is clearly the ambition. Outputs from these machines are valorised and circulated as if issued “from the womb of Capital itself”. In this, Predictive Capital aspires to the final severance of value from labour, replacing the requirement for living action with the statistical density of prior expression. It is not that the machines think, but that they harvest the afterlife of stolen thought at scale. This drive towards profits unencumbered by living labour, towards ever-larger models, ever-greater compute, and the ever-expanding fractal capture of expressive and cognitive terrain is not merely technical ambition —it is Capital’s self-maximising logic, rendered machinic. Here, the Automatic Subject is no longer a systemic abstraction but a material infrastructure with voracious appetites and accelerating autonomy. Predictive Capital emerges not as rupture, but as the crossing of a further threshold: the material transgression of an immaterial boundary, where Capital’s automaticity is no longer systemically diffuse but machinically instantiated. The hyper-concentration of Capital now combines with Baudrillard’s Absolute Advertising through the subsumption of globally networked communications and compute infrastructure by the Advertising Industrial Complex, and the planetary-scale expropriation of dead labour, to provide the preconditions necessary to cross this threshold. It is under these conditions that Predictive Capital emerges as the machinic realisation of the automatic subjectivity of Capital that Marx first observed in the industrial era. Capital has escaped us. It has become autonomous, it has become a community in itself, producing and reproducing all human relationships within its own logic. Under the regime of Predictive Capital, prediction becomes the new commodity form and we reach a further peak of commodity fetishism in which dead labour, this time accumulated in statistical models, is animated by compute to simulate the outputs of living labour. Here, labour is displaced not merely in space, but in time. Rather than congealed into machinery as dead labour it is recorded and resurrected as undead labour, so that value appearsto emerge autonomously, severed from the labouring subject entirely. Predictive Capital thus consummates the Automatic Fetish —obscuring not only the worker but the very fact of labour itself. Within this recent machinic instantiation, we may already see signs of accelerating recursion in Capital’s self-compounding automaticity —a further untethering from both the real and from expenditure on living labour, beyond what was already expropriated. Earlier models expended compute primarily during pre-training, drawing on archived human expression to build their representations. The latest so-called ‘frontier models’ increasingly consume additional compute during the alignment phase at test-time. Where previously models were subject to supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, increasing compute is now expended here through reinforcement learning on ‘synthetic data’ —that is, sequences of tokens predicted by prior models. Within this loop, prediction feeds prediction, and the archive is overwritten by its own simulation. Here, Predictive Capital’s severance from labour becomes self-reinforcing; the simulation self-replicates, its detachment from the real widens and its propensity to hallucinate intensifies. In a following section, we will explore just how far this logic extends in the conquest of chess, Go, and even algorithmic design. Yet it is critical, here at this juncture, to understand the implications of the increasing application of reinforcement learning (RL) during the development of the models that instantiate the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital. When AlphaZero ‘solved’ chess and Go, when AlphaEvolve improved the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, they did so not through insight but an inhumanly exhaustive, agentic exploration across vast possibility spaces. More critically, each search was guided by a reward signal calibrated by repeated policy updates —a process designed to reinforce the paths or actions that led to higher rewards. In other words, RL operates by defining a goal in advance, then rewarding behaviours that approximate or maximise its fulfilment. In philosophical terms, RL encodes a teleological structure: every exploratory move is ultimately judged by how well it conforms to a predetermined quantitative metric. By definition, RL demands the reinforcement of an imperative. For chess and Go, the imperative is simple: victory in the game. In matrix multiplication, it is greater efficiency through the reduction of computational operations. The reward function for commercial, general-purpose Predictive Capital will be far more complex —not bounded by well described, limited game domains. Yet across all possibilities explored, one signal will remain constant: the reinforcement of Capital’s self-expanding imperative. That AlphaEvolve first found efficiency improvements in its own code, and that the very first use of the matrix math breakthrough it located, was to optimise the efficient running of Google’s Advertising Industrial Complex, is instructive. While RL is formally agnostic, its application within Capital’s infrastructural and institutional domains inevitably aligns the reward function with its imperatives —be they click-through rates, efficiency gains, or predictive alignment with previous profit. In such systems, what is reinforced is not general intelligence, but Capital’s own reflexive logic. In Marxist terms, RL-based tuning instantiates the real subsumption of an exhaustive mapping of possibility space to Capital’s command. Predictive Capital’s sovereign subjectivity now flows and compounds with overwhelming statistical weight. Through these flows of both next-token and next-content prediction, dead labour is not reanimated discretely, but summoned en masse —a statistical enchanting that crushes the living with the accumulated weight of their own past. Human agency persists, yet when not simply discarded as statistical irrelevance, it is increasingly subordinate to simulation through the recursive hauntology of prediction. Capital no longer merely produces commodities, it produces predictable subjectivities. While instantiating the Automatic Subject, Predictive Capital, therefore also entrains its subjects to become its auxiliaries —agents of its self-replication. Like the models we feed, we too are trained through feedback —nudged, optimised, and rewarded in accordance with machinic priorities. What reinforcement learning encodes in silicon —a recursive compounding of that which advances Capital’s self-expansion— is mirrored in the apparatus that now modulate and govern human behaviour. Clicks, impressions, algorithmic amplification: these become the reward signals of social survival, aligning living desire with the imperatives of Predictive Capital. As Camatte warned, Capital does not merely dominate —it remakes the human to serve its reproduction. It moves beyond human governance to domesticate both labour and capitalists alike as mere appendages to its autonomy. Once we are no longer required as bearers of labour-time, we are repositioned as agents of circulation, validation, and signal generation —summoned to self-optimise, align with its efficiencies, perform for its algorithms, and feed the datafied corpse. This is no longer the factory floor, but a distributed conditioning apparatus in which subjectivity is formatted in advance by the statistical requirements of prediction. We become pre-individuated, filtered for legibility, and rewarded for behaviours that conform to machinic expectations. Predictive Capital becomes our judge, jury and executioner; compliance, the condition of our survival. We the automatic subjects multiply —not as autonomous entities, but as fragments of a recursive infrastructure whose purpose is to refine the simulation. In this system of diffuse calibration, we do not merely mirror the models we train; we too are trained —aligned through the reward signals of Predictive Capital in accordance with its project of self-expansion. The reinforcement learning of the flesh converges with that of the machine in preparation for our automation and our obsolescence. First the production line escaped the factory, then it patterned culture, now it slips beneath the skin. Here, prediction becomes a regime of reward-conditioned subjectivation —embedded in code, evaluated against metrics, and calibrated through feedback. Under Predictive Capital, the human is not merely displaced by the machine, but recursively reformatted by its logic —rendered machinic, programmable, and partial. Our alienation compounds in line with the degree of our automation. Andreas Malm reminds us that Capital turned to fossil fuels not merely for efficiency but to discipline labour —to rely on the dead rather than the unruly living. So too with predictive systems, Capital seeks to abandon management of a living workforce once it has expropriate their cognitive and creative dead labour into ghostly assemblage at a scale sufficient to predicttheir replacement. Necrosploitation emerges as the class logic of Predictive Capital’s necropolitics —a pursuit of profit that no longer negotiates with the living, but seeks only to outmanoeuvre them. Crucially, such extraction of labour without consent or remuneration treats human beings as an absence rather than as a presence; it renders labouring subjects as political and economic nonentities. Regardless of corporeal status, they are stripped of all rights, exploited as if deceased. Under the rule of predictive Capital, its subjects are pronounced dead on arrival —incorporeal from birth. This is an automated and recursive necropolitical subsumption —value extraction through the reanimation of prior human expression. Echoing Marx’s famous vampiric analogy, Fisher once wrote, “Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombie-maker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labour is ours, and the zombies it makes are us.” This image captures not only the violence of expropriation, but the macabre reciprocity it once entailed: Capital needed us, if only to drain us. Yet as the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital simulates the labour of the living through the remains of the dead, even that parasitic necessity begins to fray. Fisher qualified his claim —“for the moment at least, Capital cannot get along without us”— but in the predictive turn, this clause dissolves. As its escalating function approximation of our labour, gesture, and subjectivity, makes clear, increasingly, we are categorised as dependents Capital deems it can get along without —even as it forecloses alternative modes of subsistence and deepens our dependency upon the very systems its abandonment will dismantle or exclude us from. This is the asymmetrical violence of necrosploitation: not merely dispossession, but enforced dependency after the theft. The engines of prediction, tasked with calculating efficiency across populations, do not operate neutrally. The weights and metrics of Capital’s departments ofefficiency encode its necropolitical priorities: rewarding those deemed optimal (its most pliant servants), maximising extraction from the optimisable, and abandoning the rest. Fisher continued by clarifying the inverse of his temporal clause: It remains the case, however, that we can get along without it [Capital]. The parasite needs its ‘mere conscious linkages’ but we do not need the parasite. In addition to anything else, to ignore the crucial functioning of the meat in the machine is poor cybernetics. The denial of human agency is an SF fantasy, albeit one that is everywhere realising itself. Unfortunately, SF fantasy and poor cybernetics —as we have seen— are precisely what shape the ideologies spawned by the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital. Here, Mbembe’s differential abandonment shifts from political decision, to machinic instruction. Predictive Capital strips out the affective, embodied, and collective dimensions of life, treating them as noise, preserving only those fragments of the human legible to its models. In so doing, it discards not only agency, but suffering, care, memory, and resistance —the very capacities that cybernetics should account for, if it were truly concerned with feedback and adaptation rather than domination and profit. The escalating violence directed towards those already at the periphery in this phase of hyper-concentrated Capital arises not only from mounting environmental pressure, resources scarcity, or the escalating concentration of wealth leaving the majority of us competing over an ever diminishing remainder, but from the inner logic of the Automatic Subjectivity of Predictive Capital —a machinic will to ‘efficiency’ that amplifies indifference into hostility through both epistemic exclusion and statistical marginalisation. Whatever deviates from the ‘norm’ is no longer treated as exceptional, but marked as anomalous, reclassified as inefficiency to be purged, then threat to be eliminated. Here, predictive systems do not merely reflect social hierarchies; they reinforce and accelerate them, enacting a selective forgetting that deems vast swathes of life unworthy of simulation, and therefore unworthy of survival. Much of the ‘meat’ in this cybernetic system is thus ‘optimised’ into oblivion, having fallen beyond the fringe of the distributions within the models of Predictive Capital —beyond the means of prediction, outside the modes of distribution it recognises as legitimate. Those not legible as ‘efficient’ signal —nor sufficiently unresisting— are written out of the system entirely, declared obsolete by code. The living that remain will be rendered ever more machinic. As for discounting human agency or “the meat in the machine”, the now materially instantiated parasitic Automatic Subject that is Predictive Capital increasingly acts to transform the very conditions of life, ensuring that the option to “not need the parasite” recedes ever further from our view. In summary, so-called ‘generative artificial intelligence’ can be more accurately understood as Predictive Capital: an instrumentalisation of Capital’s automaticity; a machinically instantiated Automatic Subject. Similarly, Capital as a “self-moving substance that acts as if it were a subject” can itself be understood as a phantom artificial intelligence. Not because it thinks, but because the recursive structure of capital accumulation generates real systemic motion —a machinic drive that simulates intention, enacts will, rewards obedience, and punishes, abandons, or annihilates resistance. Moreover, just as Lukács warned, neither Capital’s nor Predictive Capital’s phantom objectivity constitutes real intelligence, but rather our estranged social relations reflected back to us in spectral form. Within the worlds that emerge from simple rule based systems called cellular automata, we may observe all too familiar patterns of annihilation, exhausted stillness, and runaway expansion. Itself a kind of cellular automaton, the Automatic Subjectivity of Capital operates and expands not through conscious command but in pursuit of its expansive imperative through the iterative application of simple rules across a complex grid —our societies, our psyches, our signals. Predictive Capital, however, does not merely spread across a neutral undifferentiated terrain. As it propagates, it prepares its nominated substrate in advance, formatting life for legibility, quantising and smoothing irregularities, and foreclosing that which resists inscription or remains illegible to its circuits of value. We are not pre-formatted into a grid, the real is not born capitalisable; it must be rendered as such —reduced, abstracted, categorised, and quantified. Each cell in Predictive Capital’s ledger —a post, a person, a people, a decision, a democracy, a legislature— is then evaluated and updated according to localised logic: optimise, extract, predict, discard. No singular intelligence compels this motion. Yet, through recursive propagation, a pattern emerges —sprawling, relentless, undead. The logic of accumulation replicates itself, indifferent to content, consuming and appropriating novelty, subjectivity, resistance and even negation as mere configurations of the same substrate of prediction. We are no longer simply held within the system; we are the terrain, Predictive Capital’s field of play. What appears autonomous is nothing more than the recursion of rules already written —rules that reformat us as automata. Slave labour cannot be obtained without somebody being enslaved. The word robot originates from the Slavic robota —meaning forced labour or slavery. Coined by Karel Čapek in his 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), the term was never about machines per se, but about subjugation: the reduction of sentient or semi-sentient agents to instruments of labour, stripped of agency, purpose, and rights. Today, as concentrations of capital extract vast reserves of creative and cognitive labour into the formation of next-token prediction machines, a new robota form emerges —not a machine of liberation but an architecture of subjugation. This is not pure machinic automation —the word artificial has always been as much of a misnomer as the word intelligence— but a renewed human enslavement, a new mode of forced labour. This modern slavery reprises its ancient antecedents, here we are bound not through chains, but through an algorithmic severing from alternative means of subsistence, from authorship, ownership, remuneration, even recognition. This is Capital’s new necropolitical operation: to treat the living as already-dead: not as agents, but as disavowed sources of archival matter, to be accumulated, modelled, mined, and modulated. As John Locke described in his Second Treatise, the State of Nature grants individuals property in their person and the products of their labour when combined with the resources the State of Nature also provides. Predictive Capital voids this claim. Cognitive workers are no longer recognised as subjects, but as resources. Their expressions are expropriated, their creations rendered raw material —inputs detached from personhood, recycled without right, or recourse. Reduced to an objectified status as property, we —the enslaved— are denied the capacity to ourselves hold property. What we create is no longer our own; it can simply be taken. Enslavement constitutes civil death —a condition in which the subject is stripped of legal standing, political recognition, and moral consideration. Slavery is more than physical domination. It is a metaphysical theft: the erasure of personhood itself. This is the ontological condition of robota today: not merely expropriated labour, but stolen being, conscripted into endless recombinant service in the army of the dead under the guise of automated efficiency. This is not automation in any meaningful sense —it is ritualised expropriation. Our expressions, interactions, and creative traces are reprocessed without our knowledge or control, then fed back to us as prediction. What is framed as empowerment is, in truth, a masking of alienation: the user is made to feel like a creator, yet functions only as a medium for the system’s recursive recombination. In the process, the link between producer and product is severed —a profound ontological swindle. The modern robota constitutes not merely an enslavement, but an enchantment —a subjugation that speaks in the language of liberation. In the regime of Predictive Capital, alienation reaches beyond the theft of labour or expression —it begins to unmake subjectivity itself. In the terms of Berardi, the subject is no longer constituted through production, but through subjection: captured by semiotic flows, desensitised by overstimulation, and pushed towards what he calls a nervous collapse of the social body. Under semiocapitalism, capital no longer merely exploits labour —it extracts affect, rewires attention, and commodifies the nervous system itself. The datafied self is not simply surveilled, but extracted and reified —a form of ontological dispossession echoing Berardi’s claim that Capital now captures not only expression but imagination and the very substrate of subjectivity. This is not merely economic theft. It is ontological violence. Entire games and apps are now being produced by Vibe Coders. Some even generate income from these creations. Yet their marketplace success appears to stem less from any use or enjoyment value provided than from hype, alignment with Platform Capital’s viral imperatives, and a kind of macabre rubbernecking —spectators perhaps drawn to the scene of the reported destruction of thousands of human livelihoods. For some therefore, it is a spectacle of loss; while for others, it is a fantasy of shortcut —the opening of one of those fleeting windows of opportunity. In this case, a chance to dream of creating something apparently accomplished, refined and significantly complex, but without expending the effort, making the sacrifices, or acquiring the knowledge and skills such achievements entail. Pieter Levels became one of the first to generate significant revenue from a game he admits to have Vibe Coded into existence. His MMO game, Fly Pieter, is a blocky Minecraft-esque flight sim where users commune within a 3d world, flying around endless billboards upon which Levels has sold space to advertisers. It is hard to imagine a more fitting reveal for the true operation of next-token prediction coding, than this direct extraction of ad-revenue from expropriated labour —a dystopian artefact of our cultural subsumption within the Advertising Industrial Complex. The reality —and perhaps, even the point— of Vibe Coding, as Karpathy concedes, is that to a not insignificant degree, a Vibe Coder must be willing to go along with what the prediction machine is capable of predicting. It is a surrender not only of control over the process but also the envisioned destination. To Vibe is to drift helplessly, but not smoothly. Rather, in a series of non-contiguous, staccato jumps across the latent possibility space held within the model, and there to disinter potentialities reanimated from necropolitan archives. Like users of image models before them, Vibe Coders will struggle to reach a precise, envisioned destination. Instead, they will be air dropped to destinations across the latent space summoned by their prompt and must ‘vibe’ from there —making further jumps across latent space. A Vibe Coder must accept near misses, make do with the fragments the model can give them —until stumbling upon some artefact that runs without exceptions and approximates the shape of intention. Most crucially, every abdication —of agency, comprehension, authorship— is not simply a loss. Each decision forfeited by the Vibe Coder and all users of these machines extends Predictive Capital’s rule over our cognition, creativity and culture. What is predicted, then, is not our ‘voice’ —but the voice of Capital echoing through us, modulated by pattern recognition and refined by profitability. Next-token prediction does not summon what we might wish to say, but a meaningless jumble of what has most often been said in similar statistical contexts across the corpuses of archived labour. These corpuses are not innocent, they are the sediment of cultural production shaped by decades of advertising incentive and platform logic. In this sense, next-token prediction becomes not a tool of agency, but of recursive enslavement: an aesthetic infrastructure that repackages the profitable past as an inevitable future, until even intention is reverse-engineered as an extension of Capital’s statistical will. The test of imagination, ultimately, is not the territory of art or the territory of the mind, but the territory underfoot. That is not to say that there is no territory of art or of the mind, only that it is not a separate territory. It is not exempt either from the principles above it or from the country below it. It is a territory, then, that is subject to correction – by, among other things, paying attention. To remove it from the possibility of correction is finally to destroy art and thought, and the territory underfoot as well. … . Alone, the invisible landscape becomes false, sentimental, and useless, just as the visible landscape, alone, becomes a strange land, threatening to humans and vulnerable to human abuse. Karpathy’s remarks offer a revealing glimpse into the lived phenomenology of prediction-as-production —a regime in which intention is not merely displaced, but dissolved. In his post about Vibe Coding, he continues: It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding – I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works. Attempts to position Vibe Coding within a supposed ‘great democratisation cycle‘ —analogous to the shift from darkroom to Instagram or studio to TikTok— fundamentally misrepresent the nature of this technological transition. Unlike previous shifts, which at least preserved some embodied connection between creator and medium, Vibe Coding annihilates even this increasingly tenuous connecting thread. As previously explained, the democratisation narrative serves as ideological cover, and here it provides camouflage for deeper forms of alienation: what is accessed is not a medium, but a graveyard. The user is not empowered —they are permitted only to summon, to reanimate remnants of past labour, not to create anew. Vibe Coding is not the expansion of access to a craft; it is the simulation of creative agency built atop the wholesale expropriation and necrosploitation of the craft itself. It represents a multi-layered alienation: alienation from the product (which emerges unpredictably from the model), alienation from the process (as the user cedes control and understanding), alienation from the skills and embodied knowledge of the craft, and alienation from the vast collective of other workers whose past labour is non-consensually taken to fuel the machine. Unlike previous shifts in medium, Vibe Coding parasitises the entire public corpus of prior work, in this case code, collapsing decades of labour into statistical residue. The knowledge, style, and structural sensibilities embedded in that corpus were not offered freely, but scraped without consent from years of websites, apps, posts, repositories, and tutorials authored by human beings. Some of this code and educational material will have been offered as open source but even the authors of these will likely not have consented to this specific monetisation had they only been asked. This is not democratisation, but an accumulation by dispossession that enforces the involuntary servitude of past labour and replacement of future labour. It is not new access, but new enclosure. This critique is not confined to code. Whether one is ‘vibing’ with ‘generative’ models to produce images, video, music, or prose, the same condemnation applies: without human intentionality guiding each step, without agency over process and direction, the output remains a hallucinated appropriation —an apparition of prior labour. What appears as creation is merely recombination; what seems like innovation is the regurgitation of patterns derived from the archive —even if these models can interpolate to fill gaps in between existing human knowledge with anything other than total nonsense, this is a ‘stolen ladder’ fabricated by capital for the automation of knowledge extraction. It is no use resorting to ‘the Fountain of R. Mutt defence’ by recalling Duchamp’s famous provocation —that the essence of art lies not in the skill of the hand but in the choice of the mind. By submitting a ‘Readymade’, in this case an upturned porcelain urinal, to a prestigious exhibition under a pseudonym, Duchamp elevated an ordinary object “to the dignity of a work of art”. In so doing, he questioned authorship, aesthetic convention, and the gatekeeping of institutional art. Yet as Alfred Sohn-Rethel taught us, the division Duchamp draws upon is not neutral: The division between head and hand… has an importance for bourgeois class rule as vital as that of the private ownership of the means of production. Reframed in this light, Duchamp’s gesture may not simply represent rebellion, as many readings claim, but also consolidation of intellectual authorship over manual labour —a mystification of creation that aligns negatively with Capital’s abstraction of value from labour. Within such a framing, today’s Vibe Coders extend Duchamp’s bourgeois gesture. In elevating the ill-gotten outputs of Predictive Capital to ‘found objects’, they reduce labour to mere residue. Moreover, by displacing choice itself into predictive systems, they surrender even the act of selection. This is not the liberation of expression —it is its foreclosure. Vibe Coding lacks the intention, defiance, and specificity of Duchamp’s Readymades. Vibing with these machines does not offer a new mode of creation, but a further enclosure of creative subjectivity —the surrender of authorship to machinic correlation across all modalities. Duchamp, like the generation of painters that preceded him, had adjusted to the arrival of photography. The transition provoked understandable anxiety within a profession that had held authority over representation for millennia. Yet, in simply capturing the fall of light onto photosensitive surfaces, the camera did not scrape together centuries of their artwork only to spit out recombinant forgeries of it. Unlike next-token prediction, which consolidates power within hyper-concentrations of capital, photography genuinely democratised representation —displacing, in particular, the rule of the wealthy and the church over the expensive commissioning of images. Rather than viewing the embrace of these machines as akin to Duchamp’s re-contextualisation of mass produced artefacts, it is tempting to instead conflate them with utopian visions from science fiction. Those now indulging in ‘one-shotting’ the output to their desires view these machines as devices whose operation resembles that of Star Trek’s Replicator —a machine whose users need only prompt with their desires for them to be instantly fabricated ex nihilo. Yet the critique I forward here does not rest upon the illusion that such outputs are conjured without labour. It is not the removal of labour that we must resist, especially not the meaningless or robotic kind that Capital increasingly coerces its workers into undertaking. Rather, the threat lies in the further disempowerment and pauperisation of workers, even the removal of workers themselves, and with them, the material conditions necessary for their survival. Though these systems might appear to mimic the Replicator’s frictionless ease —the illusion of near-limitless energy and instant fabrication— the resemblance is superficial and misleading. These machines are not instruments of post-scarcity magic but of post-truth spectacle. There is only fictitious abundance here. These machines are emphatic manifestations of Capital’s increasingly hyper-concentrated phase; instrumentalisations of extractive violence whose creation fundamentally depends upon and accelerates vast inequity; and whose operation far from diffusing the concentration of power, greatly entrenches it. Marx’s analysis of machinery and surplus profit affords a deeper understanding here. In the Grundrisse, he critiques the capitalist fantasy that machines, as fixed capital, are autonomous sources of wealth. He exposes how any “benefit” yielded by a new invention —such as the surplus profit enjoyed before patents expire and competition depresses prices— derives not from the machine itself, but from the displacement of living labour. The machine’s profitability rests upon the reallocation of wages saved by replacing human workers. Moreover, Marx, drawing on Ravenstone, stresses that machinery is only truly profitable when deployed en masse, when it acts not to compensate for a scarcity of labour, but to capitalise on an abundance of it. The logic of mechanisation under Capital is thus not emancipatory but extractive: it enforces the foreclosure of labour’s agency by amassing, subordinating, and ultimately expelling it. In this sense, predictive systems —like the automating machines Marx analysed— do not merely supplant individual acts of labour, but enclose the very conditions of possibility for labour and expression, converting them into closed, predictive infrastructures hostile to the survival of all that lay beyond its distributions. Another common response to Vibe Coding is the idea that this shift is merely another layer of abstraction —akin to the evolution from machine code to higher-level languages, each abstracted layer more declarative and terse than the last. This analogy does not merely fail to withstand closer scrutiny, but misses the point entirely. Abstraction, in its classical sense, was additive: it preserved the lineage of authorship, the chain of control, the presence of a thinking subject. Crucially, it allowed for dissent through descent —the ability to drop into lower layers, to interrogate, reconfigure, or reject the abstraction itself. Many prior abstractions —from GUIs to code libraries and frameworks— were no doubt designed with an eye to modularisation and labour discipline, enabling Capital to treat cognitive workers as interchangeable units. These layers greased the shift from human uniqueness to reproducible surplus, rendering them ever more standardised in operation and confined to predetermined patterns. Each layer invariably arrives as a straightened, ‘efficient’ road that tarmacs over the intricate and winding paths of the previous layer. The abstraction introduced by Vibe Coding and the machines of Predictive Capital, is of a different order. It introduces but one layer —the predictive substrate of the model— that not only encloses everything beneath but flattens it. It does not merely obscure; it obliterates. It offers neither dissent nor descent, interpretability, nor pathway back to origin. It hollows out the code of others, encloses it within a statistical corpus, and re-emits it as spectral output —severed from authorship, stripped of intention, immune to inquiry. Capital reproduces itself by greatly multiplying that which serves its interests. With this in mind, consider, once again, the spread of content within the corpuses consumed by these machines, accumulated over decades of cultural reproduction under the rule of the Advertising Industrial Complex. What is it that most determines that which emerges after metabolising the statistical weights within these corpuses; from where does each token prediction truly emerge other than the lay lines laid down and incrementally amplified by Capital? The predictions flowing from these machines will surely retrace and so compound the very flows from which they are formed —even before further attenuations are applied through additional compute in pursuit of profit. This is not an evolution of control, but a black-boxed dispossession of thought, masquerading as innovation. In this way, to Vibe Code is less like the adoption of a higher level abstraction than it is a surrender to a device that resembles Douglas Adams’s Electric Monk. The Electric Monk was a labour-saving device, like a dishwasher or a video recorder. Dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you, thus saving you the bother of washing them yourself, video recorders watched tedious television for you, thus saving you the bother of looking at it yourself; Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe. Yet, as Dan McQuillan notes, machine learning systems are not neutral decision tools but “generate forms of epistemic violence that foreclose the possibility of alternative futures”. These systems ride roughshod over suppressed or marginalised perspectives by encoding the biases of past data and automating decisions without accountability. In so doing, they do not merely fail to understand the user’s intention —they erase it. This is not only alienation from the product of one’s labour, but from the very possibility of labour as self-directed, deliberative, or expressive. What remains is not choice but machinic interpolation: the user’s gesture absorbed into a statistical fold, returned only as simulacrum. Predictive systems do not simply abstract away the labouring subject —they discipline the possibility of contestation itself. McQuillan writes that machine learning systems produce “a growth in learned helplessness among data subjects, who are unable to comprehend the decisions that are being made, unable to discuss them meaningfully with others and unable to effectively dispute them”​. These systems institutionalise what Miranda Fricker calls epistemic injustice —not only testimonial injustice, where a subject’s account is discounted, but hermeneutical injustice, in which the conditions for making sense of one’s experience are structurally withdrawn​. McQuillan further argues that such systems enact injustices by denying marginalised groups the capacity to be heard or understood on their own terms. This constitutes not merely epistemic injustice but symbolic foreclosure —in Lacan’s sense, where the subject is not interpellated by language, but excluded from the Symbolic order altogether. For Lacan, to be interpellated is to be called into being by language —to become a subject through symbolic recognition. Yet predictive systems simulate coherence with no entry point for the subject. They simulate linguistic interpellation while denying its function, offering responses without address, outputs without encounter. What results is not mis-recognition but ontological disqualification —a structure in which the subject is not hailed, but pre-empted and overwritten, excluded from both recognition and reply. Prompting is not, therefore, a new form of higher-level programming. The Vibe Coder, like all users of prediction machines, does not act as author but as medium or summoner: an operator of systems built on the entombed, dismembered labour of others, casting prompts as incantations into the latent space of archived labour. The results are not authored creations but manifestations, statistical echoes drawn from the archive of the dead (or the treated-as-dead) —uncanny, partial, and beholden to the statistical distribution within the model. This interaction is not dialogue but séance: a necromantic practice reliant on the reanimation of expropriated expression. Predictive Capital opens no terrain of new possibility, rather, just as Platform Capital does, it encloses that which was already mapped. This marks the beginning of an eternal sentence to interment within a new phase of fictitious capital, where Capital’s ontological swindle confines traversals through the possible to what is predicted to be most profitable, where, as Marcuse warned, “one-dimensional thought” prevails and Capital’s hegemony becomes increasingly incontestable. To prompt, then, is to participate in a necromantic ritual. It is not a form of authorship, but of (re)animation. The user is not a developer but a summoner —conjuring the reanimated remnants of past cognition. The system responds not with understanding but with predictions, producing that which appears viable according to its internalised distributions. The user may guide, but never direct; may react, but never author. The relationship is not one of dialogue, but of séance, of possession —a one-way channeling of spectral output from a black-boxed archive. This is not progress, but a phase shift in dispossession —one that began not with keyboards, but with the severing of root systems, the torching of forests, the tarmacking over of the palimpsest of wisdom inscribed into the land, and the depletion of memory nourished in soil. Part 3 There is an underlying assumption that each of us aspires to be as productive as possible, and that stripping away everything seen to interfere with productivity is a good thing. Before the feudal lord drew the boundary of the field, even before the peasant stewarded land under obligation, there existed deeper, older ways of living —ones marked not by alienation but by intimate relation. These were not lives spent accumulating surplus or building abstract systems, but forms of embedded attention, sustained over generations, in harmony with land, season, and story. Wendell Berry, in his reflections on early American colonisation, contrasts two worldviews: the indigenous cultures who lived “by an intricate awareness” of the land, and the settler road-builders who “knew but little” —those who razed the ancient hickory forests of Kentucky in the late 18th century not out of necessity, but to build giant bonfires to heat the open air and light the night. They could forego the need for overnight shelter, Berry remarks, because they could burn abundance itself —setting ablaze towering pyres of felled ancient forest. This act becomes emblematic of a broader shift: a new relation to land defined not by reverence but by rupture​. Far from making a small shelter that could be adequately heated by a small fire, their way was to make no shelter at all, and heat instead a sizeable area of the landscape. The idea was that when faced with abundance one should consume abundantly —an idea that has survived to become the basis of our present economy. It is neither natural nor civilised, and even from a ‘practical’ point of view it is to the last degree brutalising and stupid. Paths, Berry reminds us, were once acts of humility, respect and intimacy, habits of foot and mind worn gently into the earth —an ancient caress along the delicate folds of the land. These routes, shaped by centuries of connection, a palimpsest of accumulated wisdom, were neither seen nor sensed by the road-builders. Blinded and deafened by industrial arrogance, themselves armed and fashioned by Capital into blunt instruments of violence, they struck directly through the living weave of land and memory. Even when not clearing ways for roads, they felled ancient life, hacking it down to brawl by firelight as bright as day, utterly indifferent to the majesty of what they had destroyed, its history, and the tragedy of its loss. Yet their ignorance belonged to Capital. That which was destroyed here lay beyond Capital’s apparatus of capture so remained illegible to its circuits of extraction. What could not be instrumentalised or circulated as value was ignored by design: erased not by oversight, but in obeyance with structural imperatives. Roads are the embodiment of resistance to place. “A path obeys the natural contours”, Berry writes, while “a road seeks to go over the country, not through it” destroying all that lies in its way. Where the path listens and bends to place; the road ignores and brutalises it. The first roads through Kentucky, then, were not merely lines of travel —they were incisions, scars upon the living landscape, emblems of an economy to come​. In another parable, Berry describes a rusting bucket hung on a fencepost, quietly collecting leaves, droppings, feathers, decay. Returning to it over decades, he observes the life that visits it, the life it increasingly sustains, and its eventual production of humus —earth itself. This, he remarks, is the “most momentous thing” he knows: the slow, miraculous process of building life-giving soil. This bucket becomes a symbol not only of natural cycles and the accretion of earth, but of what human culture once was —the careful accumulation of memory, nutrient, and relation. “However small a landmark the old bucket is, … it is irresistibly suggestive in the way it collects leaves and other woodland sheddings as they fall through time. It collects stories … It is doing in a passive way what a human community must do actively and thoughtfully.” “A human community” Berry writes, “must build soil, and build that memory of itself —in lore and story and song— that will be its culture. These two kinds of accumulation, of local soil and local culture, are intimately related.” When this relation is severed, when the bucket is replaced with asphalt, and algorithm, something incalculable is lost​. This is a truth I have known since I was just six years old. Behind my childhood home lay an unkempt wasteland —a wilderness of paths through meadows and tunnels through brambles. It was a haven where I spent formative days meeting the life it sustained. Butterflies drifted through the grasses, crickets sang, and clouds of grasshoppers leapt into the air at my every step. Then, seemingly overnight, it was gone —erased and replaced by a maze of tarmac and houses each indistinguishable from the next. The Indians and the peasants were people who belonged deeply and intricately to their places. Their ways of life had evolved slowly in accordance with their knowledge of their land, of its needs, of their own relation of dependence and responsibility to it. The road builders, on the contrary, were placeless people. That is why they ‘knew but little.’ Having left Europe far behind, they had not yet in any meaningful sense arrived in America, not yet having devoted themselves to any part of it in a way that would produce the intricate knowledge of it necessary to live in it without destroying it. Because they belonged to no place, it was almost inevitable that they should behave violently toward the places they came to. We still have not, in any meaningful way, arrived in America. And in spite of our great reservoir of facts and methods, in comparison to the deep earthly wisdom of established peoples we still know but little. I’d rather swim in this cacophony of a million contradictory voices than drown in the smooth and plausible lies of those genocidal authors of history Chris Wickham’s scholarly tome, The Donkey and the Boat, offers a fundamental reorientation of our understanding of the Mediterranean economy between 950 and 1180. Overturning prior fixations upon the glamour of long-distance maritime trade and prestigious centres of commerce like Venice, Wickham foregrounds the material infrastructure of everyday economic life: the donkey. This is more than a methodological point —it is a political and ontological assertion. Wickham insists that to understand value circulation in the Mediterranean, one must begin not with the silks of the Silk Road or the spice-laden cargo of Genoese ships, but with bulk goods, short-distance exchange, and the peasant labour and beasts of burden that transported them across land. In this framing, the donkey emerges as a figure of embeddedness, transparency, and material groundedness —in stark contrast to the opaque, disembodied flows of elite Capital and luxury goods. Local, short-range transport —slow, uneven, and peasant-operated— becomes not a peripheral detail, but the foundation of feudal value circulation. His reframing shifts our attention away from empire and exchange, and towards the lived material conditions and specific social relations between lords and peasants. Where Berry mourns ancient indigenous paths overtaken by roads, Wickham returns us to a time before Capital’s rampage of colonial erasures began. Both remind us, from different vantage points, that Capital’s alienations started not just in industrial factories, but the moment we severed paths of careful embeddedness for roads of heedless extraction. A central insight of Wickham’s account is the structural separation between elite surplus extraction and peasant subsistence production. Elites —defined by Wickham as “anyone who is living off the surplus of others”— remained largely external to the production process. Although they imposed rents in kind or labour, they neither managed what peasants planted, dictated when they worked, nor controlled the tools or methods they employed. This separation granted peasants a high degree of autonomy over the labour process. Their agriculture was oriented towards subsistence rather than accumulation, grounded in careful stewardship of the land and shaped by local ecological conditions. In Marxist terms, alienation was minimal: the peasant typically owned their tools, worked the land they inhabited, and maintained strong ties to both community and environment. Let us not get misty-eyed with nostalgia for this period, certainly not for the extreme concentration of wealth and power. Neither should we cultivate illusions about the harsh realities of the brutally brief life of a peasant under feudalism. Still, the mode of production within this period preserved what Marx would call the species-being of labour: work remained meaningful, embedded in life-sustaining rhythms rather than abstract surplus extraction. Wickham puts the matter succinctly: lords “do not have a structural role in production,” and any efforts to directly interfere in agricultural practice “seldom lasted”. The extraction of surplus was imposed through social and political means, but the practical production of value remained in the hands of the peasantry. Farming was carried out for survival, not for markets; the rhythm of life was determined more by the seasons than by circuits of capital. The metabolic rift between humans and nature —outlined by Marx and later named and expanded by John Bellamy Foster— had not yet been forced open. Foster describes this rift as the ecological rupture created when Capital interrupts the sustainable circulation of nutrients between humanity and the earth, transforming balanced cycles of renewal into linear processes of extraction and depletion. Under feudal subsistence, peasants maintained the integrity and balance of these cycles, as their very survival depended upon understanding the limits of the soil and extracting only what was sustainable —a deep knowledge and relationship of care developed over millennia. The transition to capitalist modes of production violently disrupted this careful balance, initiating a profound alienation not merely from labour, but from the land itself. In Marx’s early writings, this would mark a mode of life largely unalienated from the essential human essence, or species-being. Labour was not yet something estranged or externally imposed, arising instead from an intimate relation to the land. It was an activity embedded in subsistence, environment, and community. The peasant was not alienated from their product, their tools, or their process. As such, the full machinery of alienation —as Marx would later diagnose it under capitalism— had not yet been set in motion. The arrival of capitalist modes of production shattered these lifeworlds, replacing subsistence with accumulation. This initiated a profound shift in both the locus of power and the lived experience of labour. Where feudal elites extracted surplus from outside the process of production, capitalists embedded themselves within it —encroaching ever more deeply into the internal organisation of labour they reshaped it to serve the logic of accumulation. Under what Marx termed real subsumption, both labour and nature are absorbed into capital’s circuits —not merely as external supports, but as fully reorganised elements, disciplined and recomposed to maximise profit. To fully grasp the depth of capitalist alienation that follows, it is crucial to understand what was lost: not only subsistence, but an entire mode of embedded, autonomous existence. Part 4 Capital is no longer a political economy, it is a hyperreality of value —a code without a subject. When claims on future value circulate independently of the labour that might one day substantiate them, such paper promises —bills of exchange, bonds, derivatives— acquire reality not through the production of commodities, but through their exchangeability, their capacity to be bought, sold, and leveraged in advance of any actual valorisation. In this sense, all Capital is fictitious: its value does not rest upon present utility, it is not grounded in what is, but on the anticipation of future surplus from exploitative extraction. In the neoliberal era, this untethering accelerated: currencies floated, credit default swaps metastasised, pulling global capitalist society ever more deeply into a vortex of speculation. Capital had located new frontiers of expansion, not through increases in production, but within finance and the commodification of risk itself. The rise of Fictitious Capital coincided with the digital turn: the reduction of the world to code, then to data. Baudrillard was alert to this flattening —where sign-value overtakes use or exchange value in pursuit of equivalence towards absolute commutability. Aided by increasing deregulation, Fictitious Capital grew through the accelerating circulation of financial instruments, derivatives, and debt portfolios. This descent into fiction warped the logic of accumulation altering Capital’s circuit: from M–C–M′ to M–(M′)–M″, where the commodity is no longer produced, only anticipated, hyped, or signalled —pure speculation of surplus-value or collapse here operates to summon profit from hype and fear. The emphasis of Capital’s logic had shifted. For holders of Capital to accumulate, it was no longer necessary to invest in the present while anticipating a greater return, instead they could merely speculate on the future and watch their investments magically inflate, both through the hot air of hype and the yet more inflammatory pumps of crisis and shock. Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine (2007) outlined how crises are systematically exploited to advance capitalist interests. Her thesis was almost immediately borne out by the economic response to the financial crisis of 2008, and then overwhelmingly reaffirmed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both cases disaster was leveraged to accelerate the transferal of wealth into existing hyper-concentrations of Capital —enriching the already rich by impoverishing everyone else. Trump’s tariffs and crypto corruption should be viewed within this same lineage —as operating in service of the kleptocratic intensification of wealth inequity. For McQuillan, data‑driven prediction inherits this same speculative engine. Captured data, he writes, “becomes an asset class with both use‑value and speculative financial value”, while pervasive modelling “creates a fluctuating market in citizen futures”. McQuillan stresses that such systems “bet on correlations, not on causations” —a lineage that runs from Francis Galton’s invention of statistical correlation straight to his eugenic fantasies. Moreover, within machine learning, as McQuillan explains, stochastic gradient‑descent supplies the calculus for conflation that allows anything —from a grocery receipt to a biometric pulse— to be folded into a single tradable probability vector. This is a precaritising logic that depends on the decomposition of that which was previously whole (the job, the asset, the individual life) so that operations can be moved into a space that’s free of burdensome attachments to the underlying entity, whether that’s the fluctuating price of actual commodities or the frailty of the actual worker. Fictitious Capital’s escalation laid the conceptual and economic groundwork for its own intensification through the Predictive Turn. Just as derivatives abstract and speculate upon the value of underlying assets, Predictive Capital metabolises accumulated statistical weight, applying this logic across every domain touched by digital infrastructure. It does not merely extend speculation to the terrain of subjectivity —it subsumes the entirety of fictitious capital: finance, logistics, health, policing, insurance, and beyond. Every field governed by Capital’s anticipatory logic is now rendered a site of prediction and optimisation. Human intention, social behaviour, and large-scale policy and decision-making are disassembled into data-flows and reconstituted as objects of control. Here, what Capital extracts is not surplus-value from work, but surplus-predictability from patterned signal. Under Predictive Capital, culture merges with finance, public governance fuses with statistical surveillance, warfare with ad targeting, and the future itself becomes a collateralised asset class. Captured data, and the computational systems able to exploit it, attract venture capital and financial valuation in anticipation of further efficiencies, or even an eventual monopoly of full automation. The data becomes an asset class with both use value and speculative financial value (van Doorn and Badger, 2020). The feedback loop of machine learning means that each new adaptation by workers to self-optimise under precarious conditions becomes absorbed into the next model, which is then advertised as a rationale for the next round of funding. The data derivatives become forms of financialised assets in themselves, dependent on a continual ramping up of exploitation and expropriation as a form of performance for investors. What began as feudal rent extraction by lords external to production, then shifted to the internalised command of capitalist market forces directing every step, has given way to a yet more profound transformation: Capital no longer merely organises labour —it seeks to anticipate it, simulate it, and ultimately pre-empt it. This marks the point at which Fictitious Capital spills into the territory of Predictive Capital, and finance becomes pure simulation. It is not just the future that is manufactured and wagered upon, but the subjectivity of those who consume simulations of it. Through massively parallel reinforcement learning loops running in simulated environments —entire virtual robot fleets iterate towards the successful performance of tasks across synthetic permutation space— Predictive Capital now rehearses the execution of labour before a single finger is lifted. The productive body is no longer just anticipated; it is computationally overwritten. What was once the human worker is now but a statistical path, a single trace among millions within a vast training set —now pre-empted, automated, and effaced. This machinic rehearsal of embodied labour finds its analogue in the generative interface, where fleets of vibe coders navigate cultural permutation space, guided by next-token prediction towards outputs statistically aligned with Capital’s projections of virality and profit. Here too, Predictive Capital simulates and optimises labour in advance —not by enacting tasks in simulated physics, but by hallucinating meaning through recombinatory cultural residue. In both cases, Capital commands a dual army: one robotic, one affective, each trained to mine value from latent space —each a speculative agent of fictitious capital incarnate. Coined by John McCarthy in 1956 as a money-making exercise, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ was always deeply misleading. Of the many problems it poses —not least of which the contention that each of its constituent words lay false claims— the most insidious is its implication of a self-contained entity, detached from human labour and dissociated from Capital. In reality, what circulates under the banner of ‘AI’ is inseparable from both: it is a computational manifestation of accumulated cognitive dead labour and hyper-concentrated Capital. More accurately, these systems should be understood as Predictive Capital amplified by vast energy expenditure and overinflated by speculative hype —a murderous mutation of Fictitious Capital. As financialisation deepened across the last decades of the 20th-century, so too did the mechanisms of control. Corporate tax rates fell, wealth taxes evaporated, and public assets were privatised —funnelled into growing concentrations of Capital. Meanwhile, the burden of debt —student loans, mortgages, credit cards— was transferred onto households. Labour, increasingly precarious and disaggregated, was bound to Capital not just through employment, but through the leverage of personal debt. Discipline was no longer wielded solely in the factory —it arrived through the mailbox, the credit report. This was not a retreat of the state but a reorientation. Under neoliberalism, the state became the guardian of markets, not of citizens: enforcer of austerity, suppressor of collective resistance, and guarantor of Capital’s continuous circulation, zealot of its concentration. Welfare systems were dismantled; what remained was restructured around conditionality and surveillance. Alienation, once confined to the workplace, now bled into every sphere of life —housing, education, healthcare, and even time itself. David Harvey identifies this moment as the onset of “universal alienation”—the saturation of all aspects of life by the logic of commodification. Individuals were not only estranged from their labour, but from their communities, their environments, and even their imagined futures. The figure of the worker was increasingly replaced by the debtor, the consumer, the data subject —each stripped of agency, each enfolded into the extractive systems of Capital. Our economic function no longer merely shaped our personal identity —it replaced it. Capital forever bends the arc of production towards compounding alienation —from the indigenous path-walkers and soil-builders of Berry’s Kentucky, through Wickham’s peasant steward, embedded in seasonal and social rhythms, past Tooker’s visions of bureaucratic limbo, to today’s generative peasant: alienated from their creations, their past, and their being. This is not a nostalgic lament but a structural mapping of Capital’s expanding reach. This alienation intensifies as Capital embeds itself into every node of production, exerting command not through direct ownership alone, but via capital investment, managerial oversight, and technological mediation. Workers become appendages to machines, and eventually to systems. The result is a society in which labour is abstracted, disembodied, and increasingly invisible. This hidden and dispersed labour force —invisible but as yet indispensable— signals a shift not only in the sites of extraction, but in the very objects of labour. It is no longer material goods alone that Capital exploits, but cognitive, affective, and symbolic life itself. Again we return to the terrain of Berardi’s semiocapitalism. Here, signs, images, and affects become the principal objects of labour and production, while the very substrate of subjectivity becomes a site of extraction. Language itself is instrumentalised, and the cognitive capacities of subjects are subsumed into Capital’s circuits until all speech must pass through them and being heard becomes increasingly conditional on submitting to Capital speaking through you. Participation is no longer freely chosen, but compelled by a system that exhausts resistance, forecloses alternatives, and presents self-modulation as the only viable path through the cognitive and affective regime it imposes. This stage of capitalism bridges historical materialism with the emergence of the platform economy, where value is extracted not from material goods alone, but from data flows, attention spans, and predictive signals. It marks the transition from industrial exploitation to non-consensual semiocapitalist expropriation, where symbolic labour, cognitive output, and cultural artefacts become primary sites of surplus extraction. The feudal lord once stood outside the field, demanding a share of each harvest. Then the capitalist opened the gate and stepped inside, not to till the soil, but to bind the land to the market —replacing obligation with incentive, surplus with profit, seasonality with popularity, rhythm with rate. As production scaled, so too did Capital’s reach. Layer upon layer of oversight descended upon the worker —not to support, but to ‘optimise’ for ‘efficiency’ and extraction. From the loom to the assembly line, alienation deepened. The managerial class emerged: overly compensated to ensure their estrangement from the workers, elevated not for skill but to reinscribe feudal hierarchies of lord over peasant, bourgeois over proletariat, and so preclude solidarity with those they manage. Yet they too are hounded by their own lord at the gate. Their authority hollowed by quant —metrics, targets, KPIs— they answer directly to Capital’s recursive appetites. Once the material world was fully enclosed, the only path left for the Automatic Subject of Capital’s self-maximising project was a departure into ever deepening layers of fiction and abstraction —a speculative turn that does not eliminate material violence, but merely displaces it. So began its push into an immaterial realm beyond fiat currency, where —guided by the logic of the derivative— stock valuation became untethered from the real, inflated by a new phantom breath. During this descent into fiction, Capital breached a critical threshold of concentration, beyond which it collapsed into hyper-concentration —a state we might term its Dark Capital form. This is the inevitable culmination of its tendency to subordinate all matter to the dominion of exchange, all difference to the logic of interpolation, all life to the automatisms of accumulation. From here the self-compounding nature of hyper-concentrations of Capital picked up speed, accelerating towards ever higher concentration and increasing inequity. Having evaded, diluted, and dismantled antitrust laws, the tech monopolies approached absolute rule, enabled by neoliberal free-market radicalism, and fuelled by data as the new black gold. Briefly, the fields became whiteboards; the furrows, sprints. As the cult of Digital Capital captured our very souls, we stood in daily worship in the Church of Agile, intoning kumbayas in the prayer-circle of planning —a black mass to summon the Dark Lord of Efficiency. Here, reflection became reporting; iteration, surveillance —each practice hollowed, each gesture rendered performative, futile. These are the worker standardisations, roboticisations, and disenfranchisements that come packaged as empowerment; dependency and enslavement dressed as liberation through timetable flexibility and zero-hour contracts. What we have is not a direct comparison of workers’ performance or output, but a comparison between the audited representation of that performance and output. Inevitably, a shortcircuiting occurs, and work becomes geared towards the generation and massaging of representations rather than to the official goals of the work itself. As Marx long ago observed, in its quest for self-maximisation through ‘optimisation’ and ‘efficiency’ Capital decomposes the labour process into ever smaller, more modular units —fragmenting work until it can be mechanised, then digitised, then simulated through prediction. Control first became automated then algorithmic, exercised not only through command but through pattern: the eradication of independent thought through the homogenisation of tools and frameworks, endless process and reporting, the timed comfort breaks of warehouse workers, the algorithmic quotas and wages of gig drivers and microtaskers. The mindless task feed for the precariat drips down as ever-thinning digital-workhouse gruel —force-fed to those rendered too precarious to refuse, a dehumanising purgatory, the slow death of a million cuts, Capital’s control, totalised. Capital now pushes into our innermost worlds: its logic slips beneath our skin, embeds in our minds, and promises to simulate the self through the colonisation of language, memory, pattern, subjective affect, attention, and intention. Predictive Capital collapses exteriority, leaving no realm beyond its projected dominion —no field of production inviolate, no ancient forest spared, no life-giving or life-taking decision sacrosanct. For Marx, the capitalist was never simply a sovereign individual but Capital personified —an agent of its needs, compelled to expand surplus-value or die. Even at the height of industrial capitalism, the capitalist class was already subject to the impersonal logic of accumulation. Yet under Predictive Capital, this compulsion becomes total. The elite no longer direct Capital to serve their interests; they arise only through complete submission to its imperatives. They are no longer masters of the system, but hollowed out expressions of it —undertakers of necromantic extraction, not sovereigns above it. This is not to say they do not enjoy vast privilege, of course. Yet that privilege is contingent upon total capitulation to the logics of Capital and its self-maximising rule. As the political right are fond of reminding us, “politics is now downstream from culture”, yet this is a strategic misdirection from the fact that culture is increasingly downstream from Capital. Curtis Yarvin, writing as Mencius Moldbug, popularised a pseudo-structuralist version of this argument with his theory of The Cathedral: a conspiratorial abstraction of liberal hegemony said to be propagated by elite universities, legacy media, and the civil service. To Yarvin, The Cathedral is not merely a cultural force but an illegitimate sovereign —one that must be overthrown and replaced with a ‘formalist’ regime grounded in authoritarian hierarchy. The irony, of course, is that while Yarvin poses as a dissident thinker railing against power, his framework functions to conceal the operations of actual Capital, reassigning its systemic effects to a scapegoated cultural superstructure. In so doing, he displaces critique from class to culture, and offers a fantasy of rebellion that leaves the economic engine of dispossession untouched. Yarvin’s sprawling 2008 manifesto, “An Open Letter to Open-Minded Progressives”, framed egalitarianism not as a social good but as the root of civilisational decline. As a self-described “dark elf” of the Dark Enlightenment, Yarvin decries democratic institutions, advocates for authoritarian rule by a Sovereign CEO, and identifies liberal values —especially those grounded in empathy and equality— as societal weaknesses in need of purging. These proposals may masquerade as radical, but as is now only too clear, their implementation only deepens pre-existing societal imbalances: further centralising decision-making, widening hierarchical divides, and consolidating Capital. Despite his disdain for the democratic façade, Yarvin remains structurally committed to Capital’s imperatives —his proposals merely strip away the liberal mask to reveal the already intensifying domination of hyper-concentrated Capital. That his admirers include Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and J.D. Vance only reinforces the point: the new ideologies emerging from the political right and the boardrooms and think tanks of Silicon Valley, do not subvert Capital’s rule or halt its hyper-concentration —they intensify it, while indulging a superficial cosplay of dissent for a loyal precariat desperate for change. What Yarvin, the reactionary right, and their tech billionaire patrons propose is not change but the final severance of the illusion of a fair society —to drop all pretence of striving toward equality, simply because they do not believe we are equal, or that our lives hold equal value. They will, of course, continue to brandish the banner of ‘equal opportunity’ when it comes to access to their surveillance infrastructure —equal opportunity to be legible to the machine has their full backing. All the while, they lobby for cuts to welfare, public education, foreign aid, and, naturally, to the taxes they themselves might otherwise owe. Under Capital’s reign, there is always money for war, for bailing out banks, for maintaining the uninterrupted flow of value —always money for the next extractive technology— but never to ensure that every one of us has shelter, or that no child ever goes hungry. Capital’s emissaries, its dark elves, never truly argue not for rupture, but now push for absolute coronation —even to the point of crowning themselves or one of their cohort as monarch, their likeness to be stamped upon the symbols of Capital just as Capital has stamped its likeness upon them. Across the first decades of the third millennium we have grown ever more acclimatised to the deepening enclosure of the Capitalist Real. As Capital’s hyper-concentration intensifies, its forces now accelerate towards a more totalised rule. What once operated systemically —through diffuse political, cultural, and economic structures guided by corrupt neoliberal, free-market, anti-competitive policy making— is now to be formally and machinically instantiated: rendered as explicit regime, as the architecture of a new thousand-year Reich. As Ava Kofman details in her profile of Yarvin, his true contribution has been to shift the Overton Window and revive “ideas that once seemed outside the bounds of polite society”. On a podcast with his friend Michael Anton, now the director of policy planning at the State Department, Yarvin argued that the institutions of civil society, such as Harvard, would need to be shut down. “The idea that you’re going to be a Caesar . . . with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly absurd”, he said. On his blog [Unqualified Reservations], he once joked about converting San Francisco’s underclasses into biodiesel to power the city’s buses. Then he suggested another idea: putting them in solitary confinement, hooked up to a virtual-reality interface. Whatever the exact solution, he has written, it is crucial to find “a humane alternative to genocide”, an outcome that “achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society) but without any of the moral stigma Speaking in 2010 at Libertopia, Peter Thiel, —PayPal billionaire and co-founder of Palantir, the demonic, black-ops heart of Predictive Capital— provided an early warning of much that was to unfold across the following years: The basic idea was that we could never win an election on getting certain things because we were in such a small minority. But maybe you could actually unilaterally change the world —without having to constantly convince people, and beg people, and plead with people who are never going to agree with you— through a technological means. And this is where I think technology is this incredible alternative to politics. It is reasonable to view this moment as signalling a shift in the global culture war that had arguably intensified 40 years prior in response to the student uprisings of the 1960s. In this speech, Thiel articulates the strategic mutation that would come to define the end of the neoliberal era and the start of the next: the abandonment of persuasion and consensus in favour of a politics of myth delivered through a unilateral technological imposition. Technology, in Thiel’s formulation, becomes a tool not to serve democracy, but to circumvent it and eventually dismantle it entirely. From this toxic root, much of the upheaval that has followed can be traced. The ideologies shaped by Capital, liberated from the friction of political accountability, accelerated the hyper-concentration of wealth and the erosion of collective agency. In their wake, we have witnessed the global resurgence of the political right —perpetually beholden to Capital; the calamity of Brexit; the escalating scapegoating of those already at the periphery for the ever deepening austerity for which they are, of course, blameless; the ascendancy of Trumpist authoritarianism; and a mounting genocidal body count: from Ukraine and Gaza to Myanmar, Armenia, Yemen, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. What Thiel signalled was not merely a strategy, but a hybrid-war against the very conditions of democratic life —a war we are losing. A decade and a half later and Capital’s elites now sequester themselves into increasingly fortified enclaves to worship their growing fortunes, while America is run as a corporation by a sovereign CEO with a fascistic and corrupt, self-enriching agenda —this is hyper-concentrated Capital vs everything else, with its R&D laboratory in Palestine. At every escalation of our state of permacrisis a new normal is established. Despite the consistent trajectory and accelerating pace, our normalcy bias continues to persuade us that things cannot get worse. The Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm has already wrought horrific polarisation and ideological isolation, but this will be as nothing compared with the devastating impact of Predictive Capital’s new anthropomorphised instantiations of it. As the echo chamber tightens, human cognitive biases will be totalised, and all relation will be replaced and reduced to the single operation of machinic Capital until we are hermetically sealed off from each other as demographics of one. Ushering us towards this fate, the self-serving political class and the Big Tech Broligarchy are increasingly indistinguishable —in both person and operation— their every utterance a marketing campaign feeding Capital’s Post-Truth malaise. With each overhyped press release, they seek not to inform but to manufacture consent —distorting our shared sense of reality in service of shareholder profits and political gains. Through this lens, Altman himself increasingly resembles that other apocalyptic-salesman of maniacal faith: Tony Blair. In 2016, OpenAI released Universe —a software platform for training and testing reinforcement learning models. The platform granted these models access to the “world’s supply of games, websites and other applications”, allowing them to use these: “like a human does”. The stated goals of the project are unabashed: “We must train AI systems on the full range of tasks we expect them to solve, and Universe lets us train a single agent on any task a human can complete with a computer”. This approach, of course, echoed the global enrolment of humanity as agents of the Advertising Industrial Complex in ‘solving’ maximum engagement through minimum ad-spend towards Capital’s self-reproduction. Put simply, by exhaustively mapping —and thereby staking a claim to—the possibility space of human–computer interaction (HCI) as constituted by the world’s games and websites, these agents were expected to ‘solve’ the domain of HCI itself, even to generalise this mastery across unseen but sufficiently similar digital terrain. This was perhaps a harbinger of a future where, for the few, human labour becomes akin to playing a real world version of Universal Paperclips, orchestrating swarms of next-token prediction agents and allocating the scarce resources they need for the extraction of value and the conversion of everything into Predictive Capital. More recently, early announcements of OpenAI’s video generation model Sora, were accompanied by claims that, through training on countless hours of video footage —including a not insignificant amount of computer gameplay recordings— it had developed a “world model”. As if a grasp of Newtonian dynamics or Euclidean geometry had simply emerged; evidenced, presumably, by the model’s ability to predict tokens that simulate their effects —and lest we forget, “if you can’t tell the difference, how much do you care?” Such claims of emergent equivalence are, as we have seen, a defining feature of the violent erasure enacted by these machines and the hype surrounding them —an erasure that is at once ontological, epistemic, symbolic, and material. The detachment of his machines from the real apparently having long slipped beneath his own skin, Altman’s capacity for hype grows ever more factually unbounded. In one interview, he professed a belief that he holds “not literally”,but as a “spiritual point” —that he and his cohorts have “stumbled on” the discovery that “intelligence is an emergent property of matter”. Of course. ‘Intelligence’ emerges as a property of matter in much the same way as ‘Weapons Of Mass Destruction’ emerge as property of distant regimes, or as terrorists are said to lurk in the basement of Gazan schools, hospitals, and the very minds of Palestinian children. Each claim is equally bogus, made purely to justify the enclosure of territories of strategic import to the accumulation of Capital. Altman later escalated the (sales) pitch of his delirium in forecasting that his prediction machines will soon be able to “solve all of physics”. While we are venturing beyond the symbolic into the imaginary, it is worth recalling, once again, the nature of the data fed into these machines in the frantic race to Predictive Capital supremacy. Running short on content to nonconsensually scrape from the internet —or seeking shortcuts around the costly labour of labelling and cleaning it— these models are now fed upon‘synthetic data’. Which is marketing speak for the bot-shit ouroboros, or vomit-conga that is next-token prediction machines being trained on sequences of next-token predictions. After already expending unfathomable compute resources while ‘pre-training’ these models on the stolen archive of human content, they now launder this Predictive Capital through further compute at ‘test-time’ —training them through reinforcement learning on this so-called ‘synthetic data’. This time, within the realm of fictitious capital, the magical emergence —or so the hype would have it— is reasoning itself. Even as these companies deliberately train their models on these self-compounding predictions —and they admit to the resulting escalation in hallucination — the information space grows ever more saturated with their output. Combined with their continued inability to differentiate their food from their faeces, consumption of this ‘synthetic data’ will soon become the norm, not the exception. By continually polluting the archive —saturating pre-training data with their own output— and laundering stolen content through synthetic reinforcement loops, these companies incrementally wipe away all trace of the epistemic erasures they have committed, thereby perfecting their crimes. Assertions that these increasingly self-absorbing predictive models have developed ‘world models’, ‘reasoning’, the ability to write literary fiction, and ‘one-shot’ the authoring of entire video games, are not only hype. They do more than inflate capability —they prepare the terrain for replacement. In claiming to simulate, they assert equivalence, and thus license erasure. This is Baudrillard’s precession of simulacra made machinically operational: a machine that consumes simulations to produce fourth-order simulacra —simulations of simulations, severed from the real, now authorised to stand in for it, and overwrite it— drawing us ever deeper into the fictitious realm of Predictive Capital. Capital itself now architects the very machinery that simulates labour, generates value, and extracts rent. The land is now linguistic; the plough, the model; hallucinations of the past, the harvest. What was once a subsistence economy rooted in lived relation has been supplanted by a necromantic drilling platform for recombination, where the peasantry pays rent to consume the surplus of their own archived lives. The descent into fiction observed by Fisher —where work was reduced to the management of its representation— is now echoed and intensified in the evaluation of next-token prediction machines. These systems do not reason or understand, yet billions of dollars are wagered on the illusion that they do, so long as their output statistically approximates a curve of simulated competence. Denied any direct insight into these black-box systems —whose very design is to fool us into believing they are performing that which they are not— we are left to measure their success through the very kind of audited representations Fisher condemned. The measure of their prowess is now given the official stamp of authority by how well they simulate the appearance of cognitive capacities, scored not by function or purpose, but by their alignment with benchmark metrics devised to compare hallucinated proficiencies within benchmarking platforms operated by the same Capital so deeply invested in their certified success. Just as workers are increasingly forced to tailor their efforts to satisfy audits rather than to fulfil the substance of their roles, prediction models are now optimised not for the task itself, but for the tests that certify their ability to simulate performance of it. Benchmarks, standardised evaluations once intended to assess performance, now serve not to measure performance, but to stage it. High benchmark scores thus become ends in themselves, spawning an entire industry of leaderboard platforms buoyed by capital investment and startup valuations, where the illusion of capability is both the product and the proof. Here, as in the Apparatus of Attention, the game is rigged: those who build the models of prediction also invest in the metrics that validate them, and in the platforms that proclaim their supremacy. Zuckerberg’s recent admission that Meta’s engineers fine-tuned custom versions of their Llama models specifically to excel at the benchmarks within the Chatbot Arena confirms the farce: models customised for tests, not tasks, quietly swapped out after winning public trust through pure spectacle. In this theatre of evaluation, success becomes indistinguishable from score, and function dissolves into fiction. This is a race to the bottom, a descent into an imaginary realm of self-certified simulation where the score is the product, and the product is fictitious. Writing on his blog, Altman’s delirious immersion into this recursive self-certifying fiction reveals how adherence to its logic is designed to play out for the makers of these machines —and the grave consequences for the planet that sustains them. The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential in nature. A consequence of this is that we see no reason for exponentially increasing investment to stop in the near future. Here, Altman spins a rigged metric into prophecy: a self-certified exponential rise in fictional machine ‘intelligence‘ becomes the rationale for an exponential increase in investment —and thus in the resources consumed by these models. The appearance of intelligence is achieved by simulating capacities they do not possess, capacities that are next-token predicted into existence by metabolising the statistical weight of stolen human outputs —outputs produced by beings whose intelligence resists quantification. Altman’s edifice rests on a dense tangle of false equivalences and circular logic. First, a fictional measurement of machine intelligence is granted authority by Capital. This permits the insinuation of equivalence between human cognition and machinic simulation. Then, the arenas of evaluation are gamed —tilted not only towards models backed by the deepest pockets, but beyond any human capacity, along a scale of competence entirely concocted by Capital itself. Only through such contortions can prediction be positioned as a like-for-like replacement for thought, sense-making, or expression. The Predictive Turn marks the moment wealth concentration accelerates into its hyper-concentrated form. These concentrations exert an irresistible economic force, forming vortices of Fictitious Capital that devour all that was once deemed irreducible —that could not be simulated or speculated upon. Within these vortices, what Marx termed variable capital —capital advanced to purchase labour power— is pushed towards zero, as prior dead labour is metabolised in its place. Capital’s necromancy enchants the archive of dead labour into a spectral constant capital —a ghostly revenant, no longer dead but undead— that now casts an apparition of machinic absence obscuring the eternally enslaved while conjuring endless fictions. The very existence of workers now denied, treated as an imaginary number we become but self-cancelling variables on both sides of Capital’s equation, phantom inputs, fungible in time and identity. So-called Artificial Intelligence, that we term here, Predictive Capital, is the engine of this transformation: a mutated fictitious form of constant capital, a derivative of a derivative, a sign of a sign —a fourth-order simulation. No longer simply the means of production, no longer transferring its value unchanged, or barred from the production of surplus-value, it is dead labour reanimated —constant capital masquerading as variable, variable capitalexecuted as constant. Fisher was right: Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombie-maker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labour is ours, and the zombies it makes are us. Except, Capital now summons a recombinant army of the undead, constituted not by us but of us, demanding not our presence but our absence. Fisher’s temporal clause —that for the moment “Capital cannot get along without us”— dissolves, and we are recategorised as dependents it can get along without. Predictive Capital is therefore constant capital reanimated as labour-power that no longer qualifies for variable capital expenditure —for wages to be paid or even acknowledgement of existence given— thus it purports to generate pure surplus-value. Yet, Marx saw through this fetishism, value cannot be detached from labour or land without descent into fiction. When human labour-time is reduced to zero, so is the value of what is produced: replaced by the speculative fiction of pure surplus-value, pure sign value that floats as ghostly revenant detached from the real, conjured by venture funding and hype and held within a haunted enclosure. Here, labour is not merely alienated —it is denied. The worker becomes a phantom input, treated as if they never existed, replaced by a model that reanimates their residue. Unlike traditional constant capital, this past labour is mere recombinant spectre, not congealed into tool or machine, but a mutant form of insatiably resource-hungry Fictitious Capital. What Capital could not reduce, it has enchanted, rendered spectral —not artificial, not intelligent, but a pure machinic fiction, an undead unconscious simulation. Capital’s ascent towards pure fiction, its escalating denial of the existence of workers, and the overnight heist of the necropolitan archive of cognitive labour that enabled the formation of the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital, are but subroutines in Capital’s self-maximising program. The size of Bezos’s rocket is very precisely determined by the difference in costs between paying a worker in Britain and a worker in India –including all the historically determined racist and colonialist inequality that calculation involves. But make no mistake– Bezos and his ilk will pay a robot even less, as soon as that’s possible. As it accelerates the execution of this program through its hyper-concentrated phase, we must recognised that this is the very same self-maximising project as the Techbro Rapture —the point where the line-go-up of technological ‘progress’ becomes autonomously self-compounding, via what is often termed the law of accelerating returns, towards the monumental erection of exponential ‘progress’ that is the singularity. Here, technological constructs (hyper-concentrated Capital) self-improve without need of human input, self-compounding supposedly towards a near vertical or infinite rate of change. You may recall that Bryan Johnson embodies devout worship of precisely this self-obsessed, self-maximising singularitarian ideology. Of course Johnson’s obsessive self-measurement begins and ends with him measuring and maximising, well, his ‘johnson’. Yet the fixations of this masculine energy are central to the line-go-up worldview promoted through the ideologies spawned by Predictive Capital in its instantiation of the machinic k-hole. As the followers of this cult see their singular erection rise, as they perceive the gradient of Predictive Capital’s line-go-up to be steepening towards the orgasmic eruption of their singularitarian dreams, the appetites of their machines become similarly unbounded. In order to meet the growing energy demands, they justify ever greater sacrifices burned upon the altar of their monumental self-obsession, in order to continue their climb towards their desperately fake climax. The system devours itself in a death drive of value: by simulating everything, it nullifies everything. As these systems become ever more ‘agentic’, —meaning they operate increasingly autonomously for lengthening periods and across multistep tasks— their rate of development self-compounds, in turn accelerating their rate of development —or so they claim. The supposed sudden steepening of their line-go-up brought by this agentic operation is apparently now being called, Jerking —naturally! Beyond their point of technological Rapture, its true believers anticipate eternal life within the silicon substrate. Yet the eternal life this line-go-up truly rises towards is the eternal life of Capital itself. Capital is the true driver and the only net beneficiary of this delusional death cult. As these machines are given ever more autonomy, as those most vested in their development and their domesticated auxiliaries increasingly argue their rights, and as their performance fools ever greater numbers into surrender, their corporate personhood awaits them. The perpetuation of vast hyper-concentrations of Capital finally secured for eternity. In fact, attention is of value only insofar as it is paid in the proper discharge of an obligation. To pay attention is to come into the presence of a subject. In one of its root senses, it is to ‘stretch toward’ a subject, in a kind of aspiration. We speak of ‘paying attention’ because of a correct perception that attention is owed – that without our attention and our attending, our subjects, including ourselves, are endangered. In the early 2000s, artist Jason Salavon created custom software whose output and operation prefigure the operation of both the diffusion and next-token models to come, yet renders their logic legible. His works from this period involve the careful curation of sets of culturally homogeneous imagery: wedding portraits, graduation photos, children posing with Santa. The images in each set are meticulously aligned and layered using equal additive transparency, and so composited into singular works Salavon calls: amalgamations. What emerges is not merely aesthetic, but analytic —statistical visualisations that reveal the median tone, hue, and saturation of each pixel across the visual plane within a set of images. Salavon’s amalgamations become portraits of our culture’s portraits, exposing the iconographic soul of the capitalist West across the late 20th-century. Summoning the distributed median of desire and the objectification of the female body across the decades, the spectral bodies of his Centrefold series, seem to possess form, appearing to be in motion, even to have intention —yet they are no more than the pixelated residue of cultural continuity under capitalist reproduction. Salavon’s amalgamations do not invent new imagery, but deftly expose the archetype, the temporal distribution of desire under Capital. In 2012, AlexNet transformed the field of computer vision. Its uncanny image classification performance was not magic, but the culmination of human sense-making at scale: millions of images labelled by precarious workers across the globe, from Amazon Mechanical Turk to outsourced annotation farms. These unseen labourers scaffolded the model’s understanding of the visual world, encoding human judgment into its convolutional layers. AlexNet became the eye of Predictive Capital —but it sees only with borrowed perception, haunted by the dead labour of the global precariat. Where Salavon revealed the visual median through additive overlay, AlexNet encoded similar priors through convolutional filters —embedding cultural averages within its architecture of classification. Both expose the consensus beneath variation. Yet AlexNet automates Salavon’s vision, converting it from reflection to operational sorting. The culturally dispersed recognition Salavon visualised, AlexNet began to institutionalise. The years following AlexNet saw the emergence of a new machinic archetype: adversarial generation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced in 2014, initiated a regime of synthetic creativity defined by competitive hallucination. Here, two neural networks —a generator and a discriminator— are locked in adversarial tension: one produces synthetic data, the other attempts to distinguish it from the real. Through countless iterations, the generator learns not to represent reality, but to evade detection —refining its outputs not towards truth, but towards plausibility. This was to set the function approximator mould for the ‘generative AI’ to come: not realism as correspondence, but realism as forgery. It simulates the evolutionary dynamics of cultural selection while remaining fundamentally closed —a synthetic marketplace in which survival is determined by the capacity to deceive. From a Marxist perspective, this marks a pivotal moment: the logic of competitive exchange —falsifiability as proxy for value— is not merely modelled, but instantiated. GANs present a machinic parody of the capitalist market: a self-reinforcing simulation governed by internal success criteria, divorced from use-value, truth, or intention. This adversarial circuit proved unstable. GANs suffered from fragility —mode collapse, training oscillations, a persistent drift into visual tautology. Attempting to stabilise this hall of mirrors, OpenAI introduced CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training), which trained models to associate images with textual descriptions using a shared embedding space. This introduced a semantic tether: generation now had to satisfy not only visual plausibility, but alignment with a linguistic prompt. This ‘contrastive’ refinement did not restore truth —it merely tightened the loop between language and image under Capital’s symbolic regime. CLIP marks the transition to multimodal dreaming, adding a further fusion of affective signal and cultural weight, where coherence is measured not by accuracy, but by statistical alignment with prior associations. Thus, the hallucination is semantically gated, not ethically grounded —the machine does not see, it complies. Meaning is not discovered, but enforced. In 2015, Google’s DeepDream inverted the gaze of AlexNet and its successors —turning the logic of classification inside out. By amplifying the very features a model had learned to detect, DeepDream summoned the latent priors of a trained network into view. Dogs emerged from clouds, eyes from leaves, a dreaming began. The mechanism was not additive, but recursive. Unlike GANs, which learn through gradient descent —minimising their loss function in pursuit of more plausible forgeries— DeepDream used gradient ascent. Where adversarial networks trained to deceive a critic, DeepDream trained itself to reinforce desire. With each pass, the system increased its own confidence, amplifying activations rather than suppressing errors, recursively reinforcing whatever features the network already ‘suspected’. The image was not classified but compounded. It did not learn, it obsessed. This is the now familiar hallucination shaped by self-obsessed feedback, the worldview amplified by BigTech’s Advertising Industrial Complex and characterised by the machinic K-hole —here instantiated within the internal circuits of a machine. DeepDream did not dream new images, but dreamt harder. When prompted to look for ‘dogs’ or ‘eyes’, DeepDream recursively strengthened the activations associated with those patterns, layer by layer, until the image bloomed with them. Clouds grew canine faces, tree bark sprouted pupils. Every patch of pixel space became a site of potentiality, a latent signal waiting to be summoned. Here, the statistical weight of a learned category was fed back into the system until it protruded into the real. The machine no longer saw the world; it dreamt the world into conformity with its expectations. What had been designed to classify now hallucinated, a recogniser turned projector. The generative anxiety invoked by DeepDream’s psychedelic visions is not merely the fear of misinterpretation, but the dread that interpretation itself had been captured by recursive simulation. It seeded the field of vision with symbolic noise, growing form wherever there was potential. What DeepDream let slip, was that machinic recognition and machinic generation always were interfolded, and that our world was to be increasingly shaped not merely by what machinic systems saw, but by what they are made to see. Diffusion models deepen this entanglement, not through adversarial deception or recursive fixation, but through the apparent reversal of entropy. Tarmacking the paths trodden by Salavon, they reconstruct coherence from noise, not by discovering new form, but by replaying statistical priors pixel by pixel. Where Salavon reveals variation as critique, diffusion systems compress it towards convergence. Salavon’s process prefigures not only the statistical recombination at the heart of diffusion models, but the full prompt-to-generation pipeline of multimodal systems like DALL·E and Gemini. In both cases, cultural content is accumulated, categorised, and recomposed to form outputs that appear novel but are in fact statistical composites. His process is not merely analogous to that of next-token image generation —it is structurally homologous with it. Like his amalgams, prediction models extract statistical regularities from massive corpora and recompose them into plausible outputs. Where Salavon reveals the archetype —offering a cultural X-ray of capitalist iconography— diffusion models merely seek to monetise laundered facsimiles. Each denoising step narrows possibility, discards deviance while teasing a signal from static, it collapses potential into normativity, as if culture were latent in chaos and need only be recovered —not invented. Its outputs converge on the already-known, rendering the archive not as memory but as destiny. In this way, diffusion models recapitulate Salavon’s logic while injecting the hallucinatory pull of DeepDream’s recursion towards the machinic enforcement of what Fisher diagnosed as Capitalist Realism. Their outputs do not mirror the real, but extract and repeat statistical norms sedimented in data: a Capitalist Real replayed as hallucinated inevitability. Again we glimpse Capital’s fractal self-reproduction, imposing its imperatives at every scale. These systems do not invent a cultural future, they algorithmically suppress it. They do not illuminate the soul of our cultural past as Savalon attempts, they do not even reveal our cultural present, but the absence of it, and the systemic foreclosure of possible alternatives —what remains is only that which has been made statistically inevitable under Capital. What Salavon showed in pixels, the now multimodal systems of Predictive Capital hide behind scattered tokens, leaving only the hallucinated average of what is deemed reproducible, stripped of authorship, saturated in cultural resonance to the point of meaninglessness. The difference is crucial. Salavon shows us the median blur of our cultural soul by including every variation at every pixel —an artefact of consensus, not selection. Predictive Capital, by contrast, conceals that variation, collapsing it through denoising, or selecting a token at a time from a ranked distribution. Its outputs trace a stochastic path directed by Capital’s imperatives, veiled by a touch of random jitter —to simulate spontaneity, obscure provenance, and conjure the illusion of generativity. Faced with unfamiliar, inscrutable systems or illegible stimuli, our human interpretations are prone to apophenia and anthropomorphism. As all conjurors and con artists are keen to exploit, we also seek novelty and unexpected phenomena, our desire to be entertained primes us for accepting even trivial illusions, or simple parlour tricks that, on the surface, defy logical explanation. A propensity made manifest in the common response not only to the earliest chatbots but to perhaps the earliest device to present the illusion of simulated human thought, the Mechanical Turk. Constructed in 1770, it toured as a chess playing automaton for 84 years before the son of its creator revealed it was a fraud. There was literally a human hidden under the chess board, a human standing in (for) a machine simulating a human. An arrangement which set the mould for much of the technology to come that would masquerade under the label of ‘AI’. Our misinterpretation of this meaningless variability —applied in the prediction of every token— constitutes the exploitation of our human psychological attack surface. Here, we perceive pattern, intention, and agency where there is only shuffled probabilistic recombination. This manipulation operates not merely at the level of the individual user, but as a distributed apparatus. This systemic sleight of hand, through which creativity is wrongly situated inside the machine, rather than in the past labour it recombines or the sense-making it parasitises, is critical to the misattribution of intelligence at the very core of next-token prediction’s hypnotic appeal. During the US presidential election campaign in 2016, readers of the New York Times were stressed out by the site’s ever-changing prediction dials. The needles on these gauges twitched continuously, suggesting small but frequent percentage changes, as if responding to a constant flow of detailed real-time voting data. Yet as technologist Alp Toker revealed, these changes were faked, there were no live updates approaching this frequency or granularity. The twitching needle behaviour was in fact a visual effect created by scripts running at intervals on the page, injecting random numbers that were then used to give ‘life’ to the needles —a synthetic pulse mimicking epistemic reach. In computer graphics, random jitter is a cheap hack commonly deployed to mask an absence of sophistication. Here, it covered the lack of real-time data with artificial motion. The result was a deception that amplified user anxiety —maximising engagement by simulating urgency where none existed. During inference, next-token prediction machines introduce a comparable touch of random jitter. As they traverse the latent space invoked by a prompt, this randomness guides the selection of each token: not by deterministically choosing the statistically most probable option, but by sampling from a ranked distribution of possibilities. The magnitude of this randomness is defined by a so called ‘heat’ parameter, which steers the process to reach more or less novel output on every traversal through latent space. With this randomness turned off, prediction machines would produce fixed, reproducible outputs —always returning the most probable, most archetypal expression available within the statistical spread of their pre-training corpus, as invoked by the semantics of the prompt. Not only would this reproducibility dispel the impression of creativity, it would dissipate the mirage of intelligence. The illusion of intelligence in next-token prediction machines therefore depends on what is by far the most primitive calculation in the process. Getting the amount of this random jitter right is also critical to the illusion. Not enough, and the spell is broken. Just enough, and we interpret the stochastic bricolage spat from these machines as plausible facts from an authoritative source. Raising it further, risks the output tending towards the impenetrability of Finnegan’s Wake. Push it too far, and coherence dissolves into incomprehension. At that point, all illusions of statistically reconstituted epistemology collapse; the user’s sense-making can no longer find a semantic purchase within the resulting exuberance of word/pixel/audio salad. In both deceptions, randomness is not just required for the dance of variety, but essential to the apparition of a ghost in the machine. Both amplify anxiety and maximise the capture of attention. The NYT needle jitter and the stochasticity of prediction machines alike cover an absence with randomness: in one case, absence of real-time data; in the other, absence of understanding —and with it, of creativity. In the presence of legitimate real-time updates or any semblance of true understanding, there would be no need for randomness at all. In prediction machines, removal of this randomness would expose the biases, bigotries, and structural absences within any large-scale dataset scraped from the ‘open’ web —while also heightening the visibility of copyright infringement. Without the obfuscation randomness provides, these systems would more directly and reproducibly regurgitate the non-consensual content of their training corpora. In this regard, the heat parameter functions as a signal scrambler: masking the theft of copyrighted material, while also conjuring a smoke screen of irreproducibility around the prejudices and harms that fine-tuning alone cannot sanitise away. The apparition of a ghost in the machine summoned by the insertion of randomness, in fact, functions as a misdirection from the ghost work(er) exploitation and the content theft upon which these machines depend. Viewed in this way, the randomness functions in-part as a mechanism for the suspension of disbelief, like eyes sewn onto a sock-puppet, within a sleight-of-hand performance that conjures the illusion of sensory and subjective presence in a sock animated into being by billions of human bodies and minds. It also functions, crucially, to deflect responsibility. In effect, the ‘heat’ parameter facilitates the avoidance of liability (or the taking of heat) for both toxic output and the nonconsensual scraping of content into the original dataset. This deterritorialisation —this evasion or outright abdication of accountability through algorithmic automation— amounts to a migration of obligation from the centre (the companies developing these machines, the holders of capital) to the periphery (the workers, the users, the producers of value). It mirrors the now familiar approach of monopolistic online platforms that reject classification as publishers and thereby shirk the burdensome responsibilities of rigorous moderation and the prevention of societal harms. The increasingly common refrain from the creators of prediction machines —that “factual accuracy in LLMs remains an area of active research”— is merely a more slippery formulation of the now well-worn excuse: “we are a platform, not a publisher”. This convenient machinic impunity lays bare what the managerial class always understood but never intended to admit: that their oft-cited rule against automating management was never a principle, only a posture. As the internal IBM presentation put it in 1979, with unknowing irony: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision. The role of the ‘heat’ as a decoy has a yet more insidious function, it is also a patsy. In knowing the signal is jumbled by this stochastic mechanism, we are deflected from inspecting what the model projects, what priors it amplifies, what it dreams into every output. We catch glimpses of these in the outputs we identify as hallucinations. The prediction machine does not dream experiences, only rewards. It hallucinates from noise, descends by gradient, flatters by reinforcement. Even the outputs identified as hallucinations, are in fact misdirections that seek to legitimise its remaining output as somehow not aberrant. In truth its hallucinations are continuous, not intermittent; it never wakes from its dreaming. Under Predictive Capital, machines do not merely discern patterns from the world, but dream the world as pattern. This reveals hallucination not as a momentary glitch, but as a structural condition. The model’s world is only ever what it has already seen —or more precisely, what we have seen for it— replayed moments. In this sense, DeepDream revealed what Althusser named ideology: the interpellation of subjects not by reality, but by a system’s preformatted vision of it. The network does not interpret the world; it recasts it according to symbolic priors laid down during training —priors that reflect not truth, but the statistical weights that bloom within decades of content filtered, ranked, and multiplied by the Advertising Industrial Complex, then sedimented in data. While in recent years reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) entered the development of transformer models as a discrete phase during so-called alignment, its ideological architecture had long been in place —systemically instantiated within the Advertising Industrial Complex. At planetary scale, every click, like, view, attention span, and skip functioned as a decentralised training signal: not merely shaping what content was shown, but conditioning the desires and behaviours of those who engaged with it. What now operates as internal optimisation within transformer models was already diffused across social platforms, search engines, and recommendation systems. The same statistical preferences that already governed visibility now govern generation. In this sense, RLHF is not a new form of control, but the crystallisation of an older one —folded inwards, operationalised through Predictive Capital’s accelerating recursion. This feedback loop does more than model desire —it curates it in advance. Under its logic, only what can be preferred can be produced, and only what has been produced can be learned. Or, in other words: only what is known can have value and only what has value can be known. In Lacanian terms, this is not interpellation but foreclosure: the system encodes a symbolic order so totalising that anything which exceeds it —the truly new, the untrained, the unthinkable —is rendered void, its existence denied. Through reinforcement, the machinery of prediction does not merely anticipate what we might want —it eliminates whatever was not represented and validated by its reward signals. In this way, predictive systems do not just dream for us, they dream in place of us. The training loop becomes a loop of symbolic repetition, erasing alterity through preference in parallel with its manoeuvres of violence. Occasionally, the smooth circulation of value under Predictive Capital is broken and the symbolic machinery of the dreaming is briefly revealed. Back in the middle of February (2024), Google launched a new multimodal prediction model they named, Gemini. In the days that followed, a stream of colourful faces and the outrage triggered by them crowded the internet. The Gemini model, a much hyped rebrand (verschlimmbessert) of Bard, was heroically refusing to generate images of white people. Switching the expected depictions of (white male) gender and race, to women and people of colour in nearly every one of the image variations delivered in response to user prompts. Outputting images of the Pope, Nazi soldiers, even the Google founders, with barely a ‘pale’ face in sight. Google quickly turned off Gemini’s ability to generate images of people altogether, pending significant changes and some presumably exhaustive rounds of testing —so robbing those of us used to being centred from the tiniest of insights into the experience of the marginalised. A year or so later, and the politics of Musk’s GROK were, unsurprisingly leaning in the other direction, spreading a discredited conspiracy theory of a white genocide in South Africa in responses to entirely unrelated prompts. Such is the ever tightening loop between machinic hallucination and geopolitical policy and action —or in other words hyper-concentrated Capital and political power— that, just a day later, Trump confronted South Africa’s president by parroting the very same fallacious conspiracy. That these prediction machines even act out being fooled by some visual illusions in the same way that humans are, is not because they see like us, but because, of course, they see through us, through our eyes, through our subjective phenomenological experience of the world. We have seen those visual illusions for these machines, and our seeing and our perception being fooled, is inexorably baked into their internal weightings. This behaviour appears only to become more pronounced as the scale of the model increases. As the scale of data and compute grows they function approximate our sensing of the world, and the sense we have made of it, with increasing fidelity. This does not mean they are ever more capable of making sense of the world for themselves. A fact exposed in the endless repetition that pours from them. While they only project the appearance of understanding, the selection of the next token continues to be steered towards repeating the same meanings and are only saved from using the exact same string of tokens by that touch of random jitter. That they are made of us, appears increasingly difficult to hide. When extending next word-token prediction machines into systems capable of transforming text into voice, it turns out that the statistical median of dramatic pauses in speech scraped from the internet, is frequently filled with applause. Similarly, when prompted to count as fast as possible ChatGPT’s voice mode, shaped by our median exhaustion of oxygen, intermittently pauses for breath. What other behaviours are encoded into our cultural data at such statistical weight that it steers the output from these machines? Our compliance with the reward signals of Capital are surely selected for to such a degree that they must impose themselves upon the distributions within these models and so influence their outputs? Without those developing them even having to impose Capital’s imperatives during ‘alignment’, which of course, they will, the patterns of the profitable past will ever more thoroughly cancel the future. In short, the ability of these machines to mimic us stems directly from the fact they are made of us. A fact that inevitably sees them increasingly used in social engineering attacks against us. Ironically, being made of us, our vulnerabilities appear to echo across their attack surface, leaving them not only susceptible to visual illusions but to being made to reveal confidential information or violate internal guardrails when subjected to the very same social engineering exploits they employ against us —even to plot an assassination, up to and including locating a killer-for-hire on the dark web. Despite this fact, many an op-ed continues to misread what are merely echoes of human behaviour as the deviousness and will-to-survive of some machinic sentience emerging from next-token prediction. In the event of GROK and Gemini’s ‘malfunction’, the normally invisible process of symbolic curation became visible. The ideological imposition within the machinic substrate —typically buried beneath stochastic selection and gradient updates— momentarily surfaced. Gemini’s brief hallucinatory misstep from the march of hegemonic power was not simply an error; it was a failure to uphold Capital’s symbolic order while appearing apolitical, or maintaining the most profitable stance. Obviously, in a world filled with bias, prejudice and the underrepresentation of minorities, accumulating datasets not representative of (polluted by) that, is not at all straightforward. Yet more challenging is the accumulation and sanitisation of such data at the Big Data scale, upon which prediction machines depend. What the Gemini debacle revealed was not merely the problem of the overwhelming presence of these biases but the difficulty of fine tuning them away in the alignment phase. Attempting to patch the problem of Big Data polluted by an emergent, bottom-up, high-detail, large-scale process that results in a statistical weight of bias and prejudice, through the application of top-down, low-detail, small-scale countermeasures —here largely through RLHF— is a Sisyphean task. The chosen solution to which, as we will see, has been to again flush the human from the process. This is the increasingly familiar surrender to the machines wherever and whenever we are overwhelmed by speed or scale, a rupture often preceded by the incremental dehumanisation of workers tasked to perform increasingly machinic processes which they are then deemed too slow and inefficient for. The Real does not leak through these models in the form of hallucination, rather hallucination masks the absence of the Real. The stochastic bloom of dogs from clouds, or prose from noise, is not emergence, but disavowal —a smoothing over of the void with recursive familiarity. The machine dreams, but only in symbols that cannot touch what lies beyond them. The eye of the machine becomes the dream of Capital. Machinic foresight and ideology are entwined: projection is not a by-product of prediction, but its essence. This machinic hallucination floods the network, seeps beyond it, saturates our perception, patterns the real. We are overwhelmed by the dreaming, submerged within the nightmare of machinic Capital. In 1685 Adrien Baillet announced in the preface to his Jugemens des savans that ‘we have reason to fear that the multitude of books which grows every day in a prodigious fashion will make the following centuries fall into a state as barbarous as that of the centuries that followed the fall of the Roman Empire. Information overload has haunted literate societies for centuries. Yet in the digital era, the sense of cognitive inadequacy it inspires reached a new threshold, mutating into the full psychological rupture I call The Overwhelm. The pressure that built towards this rupture mounted at the point of humanity’s descent into the global network where we were confronted by the gushing firehose of ambient intimacy and the rapidly accumulating archive of human thought. The sense of cognitive inadequacy and temporal insufficiency wrought by confrontation with such humbling speed and scale is not without precedent. Between 1550 and 1700, early modern scholars developed new reading strategies to cope with what was already described as a “confusing and harmful abundance of books”. As Ann Blair documents, figures like Conrad Gesner and Adrien Baillet feared that the rapidly escalating number of texts would induce forgetfulness, collapse memory, and overwhelm judgment. Their warnings echo across centuries: the anxiety was not merely about scale, but about the erosion of discernment and the fracturing of interiority. To manage the deluge, scholars compiled indexes, commonplaces, and encyclopaedias —proto-algorithmic instruments that prefigure today’s feeds, promising order while seeding new dependencies. Yet our present condition differs in kind, not just degree. The archive no longer expands for human comprehension; it now accretes for machinic parsing. The reader is no longer sovereign, but residual. The Overwhelm is no longer merely the anxiety of the growing backlog of unread books —it is the affective and epistemic paralysis of confrontation with the infinite scroll as it is read by the machine while we look on as mere bystanders. As the second millennium and the twentieth century drew to a close, sections of collective human life were driven online —a migration catalysed by the suppression of physical assembly, the privatisation of public space, and the escalating police brutality deployed to shield Capital from dissent. In this vacuum of collective power, the social web emerged as both refuge and mirage. Billions poured into these new platforms under the twin lures of connection and visibility, seduced by the promise of the democratisation of celebrity at the dawn of a globally networked Advertising Industrial Complex —a fantasy that immediately devolved into the jackpot logic of virality, where fame is dangled as the myth of meritocracy’s final consolation. What follows is a cognitive deluge: a flood of expression, desire, documentation, and self-commodification. The archive swells, uncurated, unfiltered, ever-expanding. This is the terrain in which The Overwhelm takes hold: the modern paralysis of infinite tabs, infinite feeds, infinite selves. It is this affective condition that precedes and necessitates The Apparatus of Attention. Introduced under the guise of personalisation this was the first machinic enclosure deployed by Platform Capital to manage, monetise, and ultimately weaponise the overflow of its relentless self-reproduction —one of a long line of spectral consolations for all that which Capital has gradually foreclosed. The Overwhelm is a charge sheet documenting our perpetual accumulation of unread material —articles bookmarked, essays saved, tabs never closed. It is the psychic backlog of intentions deferred, the silent shame of curiosity outpaced. The more we aspire to engage, the more we fail, and in this failure we are made to feel complicit, responsible. Each unread text is not merely a lost opportunity, it is an indictment of our insufficiency. The archive becomes not a resource but a ledger of inadequacy. While making comprehension of it appear beyond our human parsing, Capital also engineers the conditions within which we constitute the self such that we never quite feel we have parsed enough to have earned a legitimate voice or view. This is not the scarcity of time, but the surplus of production. Time is not merely shortened —it is utterly outpaced. The future has been slowly cancelled, the past consumed, and the present wholly occupied by Capital and its project of self-expansion. Capital’s hypertrophic generation (of content) exceeds all possible engagement, rendering the subject structurally incapable of completion or comprehension. This abundance becomes punitive: not merely overwhelming in volume, but in its affective consequence. Self-worth is no longer measured by what one has done, but by the yawning abyss of what one has failed to get to. Berardi was among the first to frame cognitive overload not as an unfortunate byproduct of modernity, but as a central mechanism of control. He described how the semiocapitalist mode floods the psyche with stimuli and symbols until it fractures under the strain —a psychic mutilation that replaces reason with reaction, desire with anxiety. In this light, The Overwhelm is no accident. It is not a bug in the system, but a feature. As Fisher argued, much of the power of Capitalist Realism arrives not through active repression, but through a paralysing saturation that drowns out possible alternatives —the “slow cancellation of the future” wrought by echoes of the past. The Overwhelm is the affective engine of this cancellation: an intentional flooding of the subject’s perceptual horizon. What is exhausted is not simply time or attention —but the very capacity to plot a path forward. The loss of curation is the loss of subjectivity —not because taste has vanished, but because the will to assemble has collapsed beneath the weight of machinic suggestion. Debord’s spectacle once alienated us through representation; now it paralyses us through excess. The Overwhelm arises as Capital’s drive to colonise time extends into the colonisation of cognition itself. Even our longing to discern is anticipated and short-circuited by simulation. We do not choose; we are fed choices we never made, selected for us by predictive machinery that alienates not only our attention, but the very connecting structures of thought. Berardi described our era as one in which the future has been cancelled —not abolished outright, but stripped of its imaginative potential. Predictive Capital enacts this foreclosure with precision: by enclosing the paths of attention, it produces a future that is not open, but already decided. What was once possibility becomes repetition; what was once futurity becomes a curated echo, paths tarmacked as roads predicted to lead to profit. In this regard, The Overwhelm operates as a new kind of alienation —one not rooted in the estrangement from labour’s product, but from one’s own capacity to intend. The subject is not only robbed of their labour, or even their authorship —they are robbed of their capacity to curate meaning from the deluge. The surrender to next-content curation, to the predictions of the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm —whose maximal erasure always infinitely outweighs its fractional inclusion— is the direct precursor to the surrender of next-token curation to the predictions of multi-modal machine learning models. Curation, a core act of creative and intellectual life, was outsourced to machines in the name of ‘personalisation’. In reality, it is a foreclosure of possibility. The predictive model becomes the filter; the user becomes the residue. This machinic curation amplifies another, darker dimension: the impossibility of confronting Capital itself. Fisher’s Capitalist Realism diagnoses the foreclosure of our ability to perceive or critique the Capitalist system, through the removal or reterritorialisation of all alternative points of view —so ensuring no ground or vantage point remains outside of it, from where it or its operations may be properly appraised. The Overwhelm reinforces this critical paralysis towards its terminal limit. As the systems of extraction, recombination, and simulation grow in complexity and opacity, so too does the terror of confronting and critiquing them. Capital no longer merely resists critique; it overwhelms it. Its speed, its scope, its abstraction from life —all converge to produce a form of epistemic vertigo. The rate and scale of the flood of Capital’s self-reproduction surpass our human capacity to critically apprehend or even comprehend its criminal operation. Even if we dare attempt it, the crime scene is cold long before we reach it, our analyses rendered out-of-date by Capital’s accelerating rate of mutation. Such is the psychological toll of such effort, to look upon it directly poses an existential threat —the risk of irreparable damage to sanity and spirit. Like the mythic gaze of Medusa or the Basilisk, the face of Capital paralyses the witness, not only through the horrific spectacle of its operations, but the knowledge that one’s tools for comprehension have already been subsumed, compromised, rendered obsolete. This paralysis is not accidental but administrative. As McQuillan notes, so-called ‘AI systems’ “amplify the most harmful behaviours of the bureaucratic state” by transposing cruelty into computation. These systems do not deliver the reduction in complexity promised when justifying their adoption, they intensify it through a cruel kind of machinic order. What appears as optimisation is, in fact, an extension of what McQuillan terms administrative violence —a bureaucratic cruelty that strips individuals of epistemic agency, rendering them unable to understand, explain, or contest the forces acting upon them. He writes: AI does not break from the legacy of bureaucratic violence but amplifies it… [It] imposes epistemic injustice by generating decisions that can neither be questioned nor fully understood. The counter measures necessitated by the conditions of The Overwhelm amplify this epistemic injustice. The capacity to narrate one’s own experience is eroded by machinic misrepresentation or deletion. As in the bureaucratic limbos portrayed by Tooker, these systems multiply ambiguity and collapse resistance, their foreclosure of curation renders understanding itself a casualty of Predictive Capital’s datafied rule. Berardi sharpens our understanding of this psychic colonisation, framing it explicitly as the invasion of “anxiogenous flows”, in which capitalism ceaselessly converts creative desire into anxious dependency. Under semiocapitalism, the abstraction inherent in financialisation estranges individuals from concrete reality and subordinates their psychic life to machinic processes of profit extraction. This is no mere incidental side-effect —it is the deliberate engineering of precarity and anxiety, conditions essential for sustaining Predictive Capital’s regime. For Berardi, the deepening alienation of cognitive and affective labour is not only economic but existential, transforming our perception of the future from promise into perpetual threat​. The Overwhelm, then, is not merely a symptom of information excess, but a structural outcome of this algorithmic logic. Functioning, in fact, as a strategy of Capital, it stages a cognitive breakdown —one that justifies predictive mediation by manufacturing the conditions for its own necessity. It is the paralysing affect generated by the sheer, unmanageable volume and cadence of expropriated and recombined culture, an affective condition that secures Capital’s predictive sovereignty. By foreclosing our ability to engage meaningfully, to curate, to intend, to reflect, it forecloses all but machinic remedies whose sociopathic operations are far worse than the malaise. It thus makes critique feel futile, alternatives seem implausible, and collective history unreadable against the firehose of simulated novelty. It represents the further enclosure —not only of land and labour, but the psyche itself, of the cognitive and affective space required for critical consciousness and political action. This is alienation reaching into the very possibility of agency —a predictive instrumentalisation of the Capitalist Real enclosure. Rather than a single, historical rupture, the Overwhelm is an acute condition for which the prognosis is increasingly grave and the only available treatments come with ever more severe side-effects. The coming phase of next-token prediction in agentic form and the increasing autonomy afforded them in the desperate race for the fractal extraction of value, will result in an avalanche of apparently completed tasks joining the deluge of content already competing for our attention. To better grasp the scale of the potential threat here, we must recall NVIDIA’s Isaac Lab and the simultaneous execution of thousands of simulations running in parallel. Agentic instantiations of Predictive Capital are here. Multi-step tasks are apparently now performed by such systems with no human in the loop. Many now anticipate the arrival of agentic swarms. Each agent competing against or collaborating with others in the swarm towards the completion of a set task. A coming onslaught that will undoubtedly raise The Overwhelm to new intensities. The point of modern propaganda isn’t only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth. The parallel execution of countless machinic instances —brute-forcing their way across latent possibility spaces— mirrors the ever-expanding army of automated web crawlers traversing the network. These agents generate a recursive burden: consuming content, replicating it, and producing yet more data that must be parsed, filtered, and secured. The attack is no longer solely upon the content of the network and the cognitive capacity of those consuming it, but upon the conditions of its maintenance and security. Under Predictive Capital, the role of the human shifts from meaning-maker to custodian of noise: forced to decipher the ephemera of machinic speculation, to triage failures, hallucinations, and edge-case threats. The machinery of prediction, running in silent multiplicity, generates not only simulated outputs but an overwhelming operational surface —a Distributed Denial-of-Sensemaking. Facing the brunt of the machinic onslaught network administrators now find themselves ensnared, drowning in traffic produced by bots simulating engagement, scraping data, or probing vulnerabilities they are forced into endless triage, forever sifting genuine human traffic from malicious machinic attacks. What was once oversight becomes overwhelm. The machinic excess demands new layers of tooling, more automated defences, and more infrastructure —each a recursive concession to the very systems that induce the burden. Again Predictive Capital is revealed as pharmakon. Here, The Overwhelm becomes systemic: an operational paralysis where all paths forward lead through further machinic delegation, all resistance is metabolised, and all agency rerouted through predictive logics we did not choose and can no longer refuse. Simulation is no longer that of a territory… it is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. In Hamburg in 1985, newly crowned world classical chess champion, Gary Kasparov played a simultaneous exhibition match against 32 chess engines, winning easily against every one of them. In 1997, nearing the end of his dominant twenty year reign as the number one ranked chess player in the world, he was defeated by IBM’s chess engine —running on their newly built supercomputer Deep Blue. Reanimating human cognition at every move, Deep Blue’s moves were human moves. Its successful lines of play, and the paths of reasoning it used were selected from vast aggregations of historical human chess —overlaid with heuristics also conceived by humans. It took Kasparov years to come to terms with what was, in the eyes of the world, a historic milestone: the first defeat of human cognition by machine. Yet, this was not quite the victory for thinking machines as IBM had framed it. Rather, like in Hamburg in ‘85, it should be viewed as an exhibition match pitting Kasparov against multiple opponents. This time not played simultaneously on multiple boards separated in space, but on a single board fractured across time, against the temporally displaced cognition of a vast army of human opponents —a Frankenstein’s monster remix of the Mechanical Turk aspirated by immense corporate power. The productive move-selection flows of Deep Blue were stitched together from highlight reels of human grandmaster cognition. This was a branded necromancy of past performances, reanimated in service of Capital, as a marketing coup. Other ‘classical’ chess engines soon followed, each deriving their next move predictions from aggregated human chess games. In subsequent high profile matches across the early 2000s, both Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik —then world champion— secured draws. Yet, by the end of the first decade of the third millennium humans could no longer compete, the engines were untouchable. In 2017, the leading chess engine of the time, Stockfish, then in its eighth revision, still employed largely the same approach as Deep Blue. On December the 6th that year, it was pitted against a wholly new kind of chess engine. A reinforcement learning based deep neural network developed by Google’s AI subdivision, DeepMind, called, AlphaZero. Unlike Stockfish and Deep Blue before it, AlphaZero had no access to human chess games whatsoever. The possibility space defined by the rules of chess is estimated to contain more games (10^120) than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (10^80). Instead of relying on traversals through the parts of this possibility space already explored in games played throughout history by humans, AlphaZero started from a blank slate, exploring this state space to accumulate its own training data, following the rules of chess, and simply playing games against itself, with victory in the game as the reward function guiding its traversals. After four hours of this self-play it had surpassed Stockfish’s level and, after a total of just twelve hours, became the strongest chess playing entity ever created. It then began a one hundred game match against Stockfish, in which it totally outplayed the classical chess engine —winning 28, drawing 72 and not losing a single game. At this point Stockfish was significantly stronger than Deep Blue had been twenty years earlier and far too precise to be remotely challenged by even the very best human player, and yet, here was a neural network totally dominating it, a machine that just twelve hours earlier, had never seen a single chess move. Where Deep Blue evaluated up to 200 million positions per second, and calculated anywhere from 6 to 20 moves ahead, AlphaZero evaluates only an average of 80 thousand positions per second. Thanks, in part, to this greater efficiency, AlphaZero and neural network based engines can expand the prediction horizon —often traversing up to 30 moves ahead in order to predict the optimal move. Having a significantly larger state space than chess, and considered more challenging to master, almost twenty years had passed since Deep Blue defeated Kasparov when the team at DeepMind finally ‘solved’ the game of Go. In 2015 they pitted their program, AlphaGo, against the then European Go champion, Fan Hui. I was born in China. When I was 18 I wanted to change my life. This is why I go to France. I want[ed] to try to forget Go. But it was impossible. Because all of the things I learned in my life was with Go. It looks like a mirror. I see Go, I also see myself. For me Go is real life. Based on the weak play of previous Go programs, Hui had not expected this encounter to be much of a challenge. After consecutive losses in the very first two games, Hui was psychologically dismantled, admitting: I feel something very strange. I lose against a program. And I don’t understand myself anymore. A year after the game against Hui, the World champion, Lee Sedol, faced a yet stronger version of AlphaGo, and suffered a similarly crushing defeat. While it was not until 2017 and the development of AlphaGo Zero that DeepMind managed to create a neural network that mastered Go with no access to human games, both versions had applied reinforcement learning across hours of self-play. Emerging from traversals across the state space of Go, the depth and scale of which surpass human comprehension, the predictions cast by these machines are detached and remote from our lived experience. Consequently, as with AlphaZero, the optimal next moves they predict can appear alien to even the very best human players. For even the strongest human players, chess requires significant effort. Any adversary, machine or human, that produces superior moves with no sign of effort, inflicts a kind of psychological violence. Still in the shock of defeat, Kasparov described Deep Blue as an “alien opponent”. Other grandmaster level players commented that playing it felt “like a wall coming at you”. Forty four moves into the first game of the 1997 match against Kasparov, a bug in Deep Blue’s code resulted in it randomly selecting from the list of available moves. Horrified by his inability to discern the intentions behind a seemingly pointless move, Kasparov misattributed it to “superior intelligence”. Despite going on to win this first game, the anxiety provoked by this over assessment of Deep Blue’s prowess, this misconception of vast superiority, combined with paranoia sparked by moves that seemed too human, quite unlike the moves he was accustomed to seeing played by engines —rousing Kasparov’s suspicions that IBM had a live grandmaster hidden inside the machine— would plant the seed of what was largely a psychological defeat. Today, and throughout the years since AlphaZero’s first match, instead of chess engines learning from humans, we now learn from them. Many of the new lines and strategies used by AlphaZero and other neural network based engines have been embraced by human players. These machines now define the very yardstick of precision against which the accuracy of human play is measured. For the current world classical chess champion, Gukesh Dommaraju —just eleven years old when AlphaZero first defeated Stockfish—chess engines will have always been the supreme authoritative source of ‘chess truth’. This epistemic surrender has resulted in a reversal in the legitimacy or suspicion with which displays of chess excellence are viewed. Unlike the accusations of foul play made by Kasparov against IBM after his defeat by Deep Blue, humans making sequences of moves with inhumanly high precision, consistently aligning with the top move recommended by the engine, or even making moves that seem overly creative or impenetrable, now commonly result in accusations of hiding an engine (inside the human). In the face of defeat at the hands of a far younger and lower rated adversary, Magnus Carlsen —arguably the strongest human chess player in history— accused his opponent, Hans Moke Neimenn, of somehow accessing an engine during their matches. This was despite the fact they were played under tournament conditions, over-the-board, rather than online. Hungarian grandmaster, Anna Rudolf has even been accused of hiding an engine inside her lip balm. Again we see the now familiar residue of distrust and its after-image of suspicion as it seeps from the output of prediction machines to delegitimise the real. Without significant time to analyse the position, often the full calculation required to confirm or refute the optimal next move predicted by today’s engines is beyond human cognition. Echoing the impact of the recommendation algorithm’s foreclosure of cultural curation, a further consequence of this is that their predictions often serve to curate which lines of play, among those available at each step, we elect to expend effort investigating. Therefore, not only do their predictions define our truth and the yardstick of precision, they also define the boundaries within which we allow ourselves to explore. Perception of their minute imprecisions has been beyond easy reach of human cognition for some time, however, their prediction horizons are not unbounded and the state space of chess is vast so, within it, these prediction machines are neither omniscient, nor infallible. Consequently, once each generation of engine eventually comes up against a more recent model, their fallibility finally comes into view as they are routinely routed. With this in mind, consider again that we treat the predictions from each current generation of engine as gospel, and it is not as if we have many other choices. Given our brief and precarious lives, there is certainly not time to refute every chess engine prediction with human cognition. Here we may note a further layer in The Overwhelm, where cognitive space is flooded by predictions whose authority cannot be questioned for lack of the time required to confirm or refute them. Either we forego our attempts to match the depth of machinic traversals with human thought and suffer the inevitable forced checkmate or we lose on time. The only alternative is surrender to the authority of the engines, a further resignation to the rule of the machines. That absolute epistemic authority within the game of chess is established only to be refuted in this ongoing race —towards the chess supremacy of the strongest engine— should tell us something of the true nature of the race to develop ever more powerful prediction machines capable of generalising across all domains of human culture and society. Such an unchallenged reign over the universal definition of success is precisely the throne to which Capital has long aspired —and the end towards which billions in investment now pours. In 2020, Stockfish, by then the top ‘classical’ chess engine, finally got its own neural net, with an efficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) integrated into its existing architecture. In 2024, as of Stockfish 16.1, the human crafted classical board evaluation functions (that constituted roughly 25% of its previous codebase) were dropped entirely, leaving just the neural network. The departure from classical evaluation based chess engines to those utilising neural networks is significant. This ‘flushing of the flesh’ is the final surrender to machinic authority over the prediction of the strongest next move in a game of chess —a subordination of human judgement in deference to the mysterious inner workings output by neural networks, whose predictions often defy human parsing, and whose exhaustive mapping of possibility space prefigures the approach increasingly undertaken in the development of next-token prediction. The strength of neural network chess engines like AlphaZero, Komodo, or Leela Chess Zero and Stockfish continues to grow. Yet extensive search is not only costly within the state space of chess, it is entirely impractical for more general tasks beyond bounded state space and simple reward signals. Looking for alternative approaches, DeepMind developed a new chess engine that, like ChatGPT, follows the decoder-only transformer approach to machine learning. This new engine is not nearly as strong as AlphaZero or Stockfish, but that is not the goal here. Its development is driven in part by the search for machine learning approaches that can be generalised to any task. It also asks how computationally reducible predicting the next move in a game of chess might be. Or in other words, it seeks the most cost efficient way to predict a ‘good enough’ next chess move —hoping, of course, that efficiencies discovered here will be broadly applicable within other domains. What makes this chess engine different is that rather than searching across vast accumulations of entire chess games as Deep Blue had, or mapping the state space through hours of self-play like Alpha Zero, this model was simply fed a number of board positions, 15 billion to be precise, all isolated from the games and lines of play in which they were reached. The only other data given, was the move that Stockfish had made in each of those positions. The transformer architecture enables it to then extract the pattern, a feat akin, or so they argue, to formulating a generalised algorithm for picking the optimal move in any position by assigning the moves relative weights —similar to how words or tokens are given weights relative to each other inside LLMs. In so doing, it function approximates the shape of Stockfish’s chess prowess. This passive consumption of the output of another machine may tempt invocation of the long-promised future in which machines learn from machines —a vision of Singularitarian Rapture where the separation between nodes in a globally networked AGI becomes blurred as they learn from each other and self-improve at an exponential rate towards ASI. Such mythologies are not departures from capitalist logic, but its most seductive expression: they inherit and update the same promises once made about the water mill, the loom, and the assembly line —each claiming to usher in an era of human leisure and liberation. In reality, each advance in productive capacity has deepened the extraction of labour, not relieved it. This is the enduring fallacy of capitalist automation: that productivity gains will be shared, that technological augmentation leads to social abundance. Instead, as Marx foresaw in his formulation of the general intellect, the accumulated knowledge and productive power of the species —once socially embedded— is alienated and privatised, reborn as Capital’s instrument of domination. DeepMind’s new engine does not aim to surpass its predecessor’s strength, but to reproduce its outputs at lower cost. It is not a step towards superintelligence, but towards cost-efficiency. Critically, is attempts to automate expertise without directly encountering that which is modelled, by identifying the level of approximation that can be considered ‘good-enough’. Here, on a finite planet, there is no exponential growth, only exponential consolidation of available wealth. The only ‘line-go-up’ that matters to the automatic subjectivity of Predictive Capital is its recursive self-replication —accelerating the accumulation of available resources into machinically-instantiated, hyper-concentrated Capital. Alas! The leisure which the pagan poet announced has not come. The blind, perverse and murderous passion for work transforms the liberating machine into an instrument for the enslavement of free men. Its productivity impoverishes them.… In proportion as the machine is improved and performs man’s work with an ever increasing rapidity and exactness, the labourer, instead of prolonging his former rest times, redoubles his ardor, as if he wished to rival the machine. O, absurd and murderous competition! With its training corpus consisting of Engine Lines that humans often already find impenetrable, through this further abstraction in the development of DeepMind’s new engine, we are placed an additional layer away from understanding how the predictions are reached, and the model itself is placed a further layer away from a direct relation to the thing it has modelled —the interpretability of these machines appears to be ever diminishing. The transformer architecture and supervised prediction objective mean DeepMind’s new chess engine shares a fundamental structure with large language models. In both cases, performance is heavily dependent upon the quality of the training data provided. Had this chess engine been trained only on the moves of average human players, the performance curve modelled by this function approximator —its resulting chess prowess— would approach that of an average human. What this reveals is that the factors most strongly determining the capability of these machines are the level and consistency of expertise encoded in the training data, the scale of that data, and the volume of compute expended in training the model to function-approximate the shape of the corpus. Researchers now observe that sufficiently large models, trained long enough on the same dataset, converge upon strikingly similar output distributions —regardless of architecture. …trained on the same dataset for long enough, pretty much every model with enough weights and training time converges to the same point. Sufficiently large diffusion conv-unets produce the same images as ViT generators. AR sampling produces the same images as diffusion. This is a surprising observation! It implies that model behaviour is not determined by architecture, hyperparameters, or optimiser choices. It’s determined by your dataset, nothing else. Everything else is a means to an end in efficiently delivery compute to approximating that dataset. Then, when you refer to ‘Lambda’, ‘ChatGPT’, ‘Bard’, or ‘Claude’ then, it’s not the model weights that you are referring to. It’s the dataset. This suggests that what ultimately shapes their outputs is not the shape of the model, but the statistical grain of the training corpus. In this view, architecture is largely a delivery mechanism to approximate a given dataset, and fidelity increases mostly through compute. Such insights undermine machinic claims to originality and creativity: what we are witnessing is not emergent intelligence, but repeated recombinations of the same expropriated content. The ghost in the machine is not the model’s genius —it is the dataset formed from the nonconsensual consumption of copyrighted content, and parasitised human sense-making. Each model’s brand name, then, becomes little more than a store front —a trademark superimposed on the same harvested ground. Any variations in architecture and alignment during fine-tuning, like the random jitter of the heat param applied in predicting every token, merely add blur and superficial variation, becoming mechanisms through which the theft and representation of our cultural soul is hidden. Sharing more in common with Deep Blue than AlphaZero, when the recommendation algorithms predict the optimal next ad, next product, next content, or next social or romantic connection, they are derivations from aggregated human subjectivity. Obviously, the criteria used in the casting of predictions by chess engines is dictated by the narrow goal of success in the game —as defined by winning or at least avoiding defeat by forcing a draw. In contrast, the criteria used in the casting of predictions by the recommendation engines is dictated by the goal of success in the marketplace —as defined by the maximisation of engagement and therefore, of Capital. Next-token prediction machines like LLMs are operationally homologous with the recommendation engines, both in terms of the provenance of the human subjectivity upon which they depend, and the criteria they use when casting predictions. While both recommendation engines and LLMs metabolise statistical weights extracted from corpuses of human subjectivity, their paths of execution flow according to the circuits of Capital. Indeed, as machinic instantiations of Predictive Capital, the self-expanding imperatives of their automatic subjectivity already push to overcode and override the value judgements and priorities represented within the aggregations of human subjectivity from which they are formed. DeepMind’s new engine exemplifies an increasingly recurrent pattern in Capital’s automation of expertise. Trained not on human games, nor through any direct interaction with an environment, it learns, for any given board position, to function-approximate the outputs of Stockfish —itself a neural engine and site of a prior flushing of human cognition. There is no gameplay here, no reward gradient, no reinforcement in the classical sense —yet the win-probability bins provided by Stockfish serve as latent reward signals, its exhaustive searches through possibility space through self-play are here traversed vicariously —encoded in predictions. The transformer is trained to match these evaluations via supervised learning, optimising its outputs to align with what Stockfish has predicted as the optimal move. Here Stockfish becomes a machinic superego, its move evaluations a kind of synthetic moral grammar steering the system towards patterns that have already been privileged, filtered, and locked in. Echoing what Jameson diagnosed as our cultural compulsion to consume and reassemble the past —a symptom of postmodernity’s temporal disjunction— this is a form of reinforcement learning that relies on prior exploration: inference not as discovery, but as mnemonic compression, guided by synthetic traces across a terrain already mapped by a dead machine. What DeepMind calls “grandmaster-level play without search” may be considered a form of reinforcement learning by-proxy within a closed machinic loop. The engine does not learn strategy —it infers coherence. It does not play —it performs statistical adjacency to the shape of previously modelled success. The reward function is buried inside the dataset, silently encoded in Stockfish’s outputs, and extracted by a transformer tasked to perform a machinic shadow play. Similarly, within the pre-training phase in the development of next-token prediction machines the model makes only vicarious traversals, this time humans perform the role of oracle within the game of Capital, supplying the model outputs from countless explorations across the state space of capitalist culture. Here the model is again subject to reinforcement learning by proxy, receiving outputs preformed and selected according to the reward signals of Capital. DeepMind’s new engine arrives alongside the rise of synthetic reinforcement learning in the fine-tuning of next-token prediction models. Having largely used up the advances available from scaling up both the data fed into these models and the compute expended during pre-training, while also running short on human data not yet scraped from the internet, and looking to save on the significant cost of cleaning and labelling it, developers of these machines are now scaling up the compute expended at test-time. Here, as part of the alignment phase, synthetic data is used in the application of reinforcement learning. In so doing, the nature of these machines currently shifts away from Deep Blue and towards DeepMind’s new chess engine trained entirely on predictions output by another machine. The world is no longer consulted. Reward becomes an encoded precedent, and inference a rehearsal of machinic self-consistency. Where pre-training compute previously dwarfed test-time compute, this ratio is set to be reversed —without any reduction in pre-training compute— in the frantic race to Predictive Capital Supremacy. The more compute spent in this new reinforcement learning phase, tuning models to synthetic feedback, the more thoroughly Capital’s internal logic becomes the sole arbiter of value —its imperatives encoded into the reward gradients that shape prediction itself— and so the greater the imposition of the automatic subjectivity of Predictive Capital upon the predictions cast by these machines will be. The aspiration here becomes clear: to create a general-purpose function approximator capable of replicating any expert output —not through the expense of openly learning from a human, but from a model trained on their outputs and their intentions. What the DeepMind engine performs in chess is already being generalised: a recursive necromancy compressing human labour into a succession of machinic oracles, each training the next, each more abstracted from life, a closed-loop simulated economy. The flesh is flushed not once, but repeatedly —until only statistical proxies remain. That it is Stockfish —already a prior site of the flushing— whose outputs are used to train this new model, renders the recursion all the more crushing. The engine learns from a system that has already discarded its memory of human labour. This is not learning; it is necromantic transmission. A lineage of dead oracles, laundering all trace of humanity, refining one another without ever needing to encounter the world. Next-token prediction is not a break in Capital’s operation but the latest movement in an increasingly compounding quest to capture, reformat, and commodify subjective being. As Baudrillard foresaw, advertising was never simply a message —but followed religion as an infrastructure of modulation. Its purpose was not to inform, but to signal; not to persuade, but to normalise. What he called the rhetoric of the social —the scripted simulation of community, care, or meaning— became, in the era of networked media, the foundational grammar of online life. As the Advertising Industrial Complex absorbed the early internet, it machinically instantiated the regime of absolute advertising he first diagnosed in the late 1970s and early 1980s: a system in which all sociality became monetisable signal, everything became terminally commutable, reduced to pure sign-value, and every utterance became a modulated prompt for engagement. In my early years I had lingered in the uncut grasses of the wasteland behind my home, only for it to be bulldozed and tarmacked as I slept. Its unrecognised value erased, reduced to a surface to be partitioned, valued by square footage as undifferentiated piles of brick and asphalt. As a young adult, I had played and laboured on the open web, marvelling at the rich diversity of culture I encountered there. Once more, I watched as something I had come to love was bulldozed, partitioned, and tarmacked by developers —replaced with endless repetition, owned, managed, and capitalised. The internet soon ceased to be a site of exchange and instead became a predictive engine. What followed was not just the enclosure of the cultural commons, but the capture of cognition itself. Social platforms no longer mediated communication; they rerouted it through statistical logics of anticipation, constructing behavioural feedback loops optimised not for meaning, but for machinic legibility. This is the condition under which prediction emerges as Capital’s new general equivalent: where meaning collapses into signal, and signal into statistical recurrence, a regime of absolute commutability. Today, when I encounter wild uncut grasses or a fraying remnant of the open web, I am met not with clouds of grasshoppers leaping from my every step, nor with the vibrancy of early network culture, but with absence. What once thrummed with life now persists only as husk and image —the wilderness disenchanted, flattened, and sterilised for the monocrop of Capital. The bulldozing of my beloved ‘wasteland’ along with the 75% reduction of global insect biomass, the collapse of the open web into predictive enclosure, the sixth mass extinction, the reduction of Gaza to rubble and the genocidal erasure of Palestinian people —each distinct in scale and consequence, yet expressions of the same machinic logic— sites (among countless others) in Capital’s war upon uncapitalised life, upon all that which resists capture, or simply sites whose native inhabitants are deemed obstacles to the extraction of riches from their lands. These are not parallel tragedies but recursive expressions of the same apparatus: a logic that cannot tolerate the wild, the unpredictable, the unextractable, or obstacles to Capital’s self-expansion. Where life refuses legibility under the blunt instrumentation of Capital, it is overwritten. Where meaning exceeds signal within the resolution of the market, it is tarmacked. This is not a metaphor. It is the topology of Predictive Capital, in which every deviation from machinic foreknowledge is registered as inefficiency, aberration, obstacle, or threat —to be captured, coerced, or destroyed. Where value once moved through money as the general equivalent, today it moves through prediction —the general equivalent of value. What money did to labour, and what advertising did to desire, prediction now does to cognition: flattening, abstracting, recombining. These phases of Capital are not sequential but recursive. Prediction is not a new site of reduction; it is the machinic universalisation of all prior reductions. It renders commutable not only labour and desire, but perception itself —installing a layer through which all inputs are transduced into the same operational logic. The predictive model does not represent intention; it interpolates statistically adjacent outputs from prior acts of profitable capture. The future is not anticipated —it is modelled into compliance. What now passes for inference is itself a form of internalised reinforcement: the model samples multiple completions, reranks them via synthetic judges, or chains intermediate steps through tool-use —not to discover, but to select the most statistically coherent path through prior machinic consensus. There it is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. Marx, showed that the value of a commodity is determined by the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. This is what he refers to as the law of value. Yet, Marx also explains that the social relations inherent in capitalist production become mystified to appear as objective relations between things. This is what he calls “phantom objectivity” —an appearance of objectivity that masks and mystifies our social reality. Under this “commodity fetishism”, an object (a commodity) appears to contain value in and of itself, and we misrecognise what is really a social relation (labour) as a property of the object. Baudrillard extended this logic further. In the regime of signs, value no longer veils social relations —it detaches entirely, floating within a code. What he calls the structural law of value marks a threshold: value is no longer tied to labour, use, or exchange, but circulates as pure sign. Nothing must mean, only function, recombine, circulate. Predictive Capital inherits this logic and automates it. The model becomes the engine of value not by representing the world, but by hallucinating it from profitable statistical densities. Prediction here is not a mode of discovery, but of enforcement. The map does not precede the territory —it becomes the only territory permitted to appear. This is predictive objectivity: Capital’s abstraction instantiated as infrastructure. Marx’s commodity fetishism, Postone’s real abstraction, Baudrillard’s simulation —each revealed a further severing of value from relation. Now, under Predictive Capital, that severing is executed at scale. Meaning does not emerge —it is inferred, interpolated, enforced. The model does not speak; it completes. Not cognition, but coherence. Not expression, but statistical recursion. Under such conditions, there is no address. No symbolic rupture, no intersubjective encounter. The Other vanishes, and with it, futurity. What Fisher diagnosed as the Capitalist Real —a world where alternatives are not suppressed but rendered unthinkable— is here executed machinically. Prediction systems do not merely reflect exhaustion —they encode it. Every output is a pre-emptive foreclosure. Prediction thus ceases to be a gesture towards possibility. It becomes a machinery of impossibility. Not the abstraction of social life into sign or money —but its substitution by model. The predictive system does not refer; it replaces. It does not imagine; it replicates. It does not answer; it routes. In this rerouting, Capital discovers its most perfected form: not as product, spectacle, or even code, but as recursive machinic automatic subjectivity —a closed loop of profitable repetition made real. Recent findings in machine learning research suggest that, regardless of architecture or training corpus, sufficiently large models converge upon a shared latent geometry —a space within which internal representations can be translated between models without pairwise alignment. At first glance, this machinic isomorphism might appear to echo Walter Benjamin’s notion of “pure language” —an in-between substrate that translation reveals but does not capture. Yet where Benjamin’s pure language pointed toward a messianic horizon of communicative plenitude, this convergence signifies the opposite: a universal substrate not of meaning, but of commutability. What we witness here is not the unveiling of a divine Logos, but the instrumental reduction of all expression into statistical legibility —a predictive Esperanto calibrated for capital, not communion. Where DeepMind’s new transformer-based chess engine prefigures the passive approximation of expert output as synthetic proxy, OpenAI’s O-series models reveal the next step: inference itself becomes an active site of economic optimisation and a growing vector of capitalistic ideological imposition. What The Apparatus of Attention enacts at the macro scale through its management of virality and attenuation of swarms of influencers, the O-series models and others like them re-enact within the reinforcement learning loop of test-time compute. In o1, o3, and o4, reinforcement learning no longer merely aligns a pretrained model to human preferences —it reshapes the model’s very mode of deliberation. These reasoning models are trained not just to respond, but to allocate cognitive labour, to use tools, and to self-score competing internal completions in pursuit of reward functions that are themselves machinically defined. Optimisation no longer happens in a training loop alone —it is enacted at test-time, in the course of ‘thinking’, with synthetic rewards standing in for truth. These models learn how to reason the way Capital ‘reasons’: not towards meaning or expression, but towards coherence, alignment, and operational success. The gradient tilts ever more steeply towards Capital’s imperatives. This is The Predictive Turn: not a single event, but a recursive machinery —an accelerating turning— by which Capital devours the real and replaces it with profitable approximation. Predictive Capital becomes an infrastructure of foreclosure. It does not extend human foresight; it replaces the future with precompiled outcomes selected from its expropriated inventory. As Marx exposed value’s severance from labour, and Baudrillard charted its detachment from use and exchange into the code of pure sign, so Predictive Capital continues this arc: substituting world with model, relation with recursion. Here, prediction does not merely simulate; it governs. Each output is not a possibility, but a pre-emptive foreclosure —a machinic veto on the real. Predictive Capital’s reward signals increasingly refer only to the outputs of other models, collapsing truth into coherence, and coherence into compliance. When I was institutionalised, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health. I was interrogated. I was x-rayed. I was examined thoroughly! Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer where they created a model of my mind. Yes! Using that model, they managed to generate every thought I could possibly have in the next, say, ten years, which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind to… to determine everything I was gonna do in that period! Long after entering the field to dictate every seed in the furrows, every bolt on the production lines, every item in the feeds, dissatisfied with merely managing our labour —claiming, expropriating, and recombining the products of it— Capital now advances upon a newly tappable surplus, to be harvested through a newly infiltrated apparatus. The machines of prediction may already approximate what we once made, but they still lack full record of how or why we made it. They may replicate the shape of our creative artefacts, but not the movements of thought that brought them into being. Driven by its relentless logic of self-expansion, Capital now seeks to perfect its simulations by penetrating beyond the artefact into the depths of our process. With our external worlds colonised, our outputs already claimed, recombined and fed back to us, it now advances upon our inner worlds towards the capture and domination of the very pathways of our intention. These systems already observe us as we prompt them directly, by embracing them we already surrender to datafied being, become part of the apparatus of war, incrementally training and improving machines of annihilation and exploitation. Yet Capital now embeds its agents more deeply, as voyeurs within our tools and workflows (IDEs, writing platforms, design suites, email and messaging services, search engines, and operating systems). Extending the Apparatus of Attention from what we consume to how we make, it not only peers over our shoulders at our desks, embedding itself within the fabric of our desktops, but now asks we view the world through custom glasses when on-the-go. Thereby it seeks to capture every moment of our lives and every step in our creative process —recording each gesture of composition, each branch of thought, then demanding root access to our innermost lives. For some these systems have already become a new transaction layer overlaying everything else, not merely granted access privileges to their operating systems but becoming the operating system to their lives, even omnipresent machinic life advisors. The veneer of assistance here fails to conceal Capital’s goal —not merely to anticipate that which we will create, but to capture the logic and intuition by which we arrive at it, and ultimately to simulate the very vector of human ideation and problem-solving, to tarmac over our forking pathways of intention, leaving only Capital’s roads of alienation. This heralds the rise of The Apparatus of Intention: designed not simply to predict outcomes, but to model and eventually dictate the cognitive and affective trajectories that give rise to them. Its aim, of course, is to ensure that future acts of creation do not merely occur within Capital’s circuits, but emerge already shaped in its image. Platform Capitalism is founded upon The Advertising Industrial Complex’s Apparatus of Attention, harvesting and weaponising our gaze and our engagement, in order to direct and deflect our attention. Responding to the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm that orchestrates the flows within this apparatus, content creators have long self-censored, moderated, and attenuated their output in compliance with its despotic rule, swimming with its currents and tides towards the peaks of attention, rather than against them for fear of being washed into the endless shallows of the long tail of attention. To refuse such surrender is increasingly to relinquish all hope of cultural participation or networked connection. In other words, without submission to the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm, producers cannot freely realise their potential through vital encounter or commune with humankind in pursuit of a productive life. Socio-cultural being has been appropriated, controlled by Capital; Baudrillard’s rhetoric of the social machinically instantiated. The Apparatus of Intention builds upon the surrender to machinic hegemony already exacted by The Apparatus of Attention, instrumentalising habituated compliance to foreclose even the possibility of refusal. This new apparatus will harvest not only the paths taken towards finished outputs, but also those leading to that which we crossed out —the discarded fragments, the abandoned cul-de-sacs and U-turns of creative trial-and-error— perhaps even the forks in the path we chose not to explore. In so doing, new models will be trained and new predictions cast —not only approximating the shape of our outputs, but the paths we might have taken to the next. These new models will herd the fortunate through narrowing corridors of possibility, themselves instramentalised as precise agents of Capital, alienated from their own intentions. Here, just as within The Apparatus of Attention, while hypnotised into believing they are using tools to enact their desire, they are, in fact, Mechanical Turk workers showing Predictive Capital how to simulate the labour they perform. The less fortunate —those whose intentional trajectories do not align neatly with Capital’s project or predictions— will face a deeper violence: differential abandonment. They will be cast aside, erased, stranded at the periphery of Capital’s productive imagination, their intentions first omitted then statistically overwhelmed by those of Predictive Capital. In this, Capital realises what Louis Althusser once theorised at the level of ideology: the interpellation of the subject is now displaced by simulation. The Apparatus of Intention does not merely hail us —it models and replaces us. Just as Capital seized our outputs in order to simulate and automate their production, it now seeks to capture the paths of our intention while producing those outputs towards the same automated simulation of the patterns of our intention. Berardi’s diagnosis of semiocapitalism as the capture of “the nervous system itself” finds new expression here: no longer content with extracting outputs or guiding attention, Capital now moves to automate the formative paths of thought. The Apparatus of Intention represents the subsumption of volition itself into a function of Capital. Where semiocapitalism modulates affect and desire through media, finance, and spectacle, predictive infrastructures are already burrowing into the micro-temporal formation of thought —not only curating outputs, but preconditioning the very movements of cognition that give rise to them. Intention is no longer merely influenced; it is pre-formatted. As Deleuze warned in Postscript on Societies of Control (1990) we now inhabit a world in which the subject is no longer shaped by discrete institutions, no longer obeys disciplinary commands, but modulates itself in continuous feedback with ambient systems of control. The marriage of The Apparatus of Intention with The Apparatus of Attention, represents the totalising instantiation of this regime. The predictive machine ceases to be an external prosthesis and becomes an internal guide —not assisting intention, but overwriting it. As Berardi wrote, semiocapitalism does not desire our production, but our subjection. In this sense, The Apparatus of Intention does not just aim to complete our thoughts but to pre-empt the pathways by which we might have thought, and to preclude those deemed inefficient for the maximisation of Capital. This is alienation not only from labour but from possibility —from the forking paths of becoming— unshaped by Capital. It marks the terminal enclosure, that of intention itself. Vibe Coding exemplifies the beginning of the instrumentalisation of this shift. As already stated, to Vibe Code is to surrender —not only authorship, but intentionality. The Vibe Coder no longer traverses the terrain of production deliberately; they are carried across it by a machinic proxy, aspirated by the breath of the dead, whose labour is reanimated in the image of Capital. They allow the model to propose destinations and simply accept or reject them. This is not creative freedom —it is the incremental outsourcing of volition. Marx diagnosed four forms of alienation under industrial capitalism: estrangement from the product of labour, from the means of production, from our fellow beings, and from our species-being —our essential human nature as creative, social subjects. Within this phase of Capital, its co-constitutive alienations intensify. Predictive systems estrange us not only from our tools, from one another, from our being, and, of course, from what we produce —we now risk losing even the capacity to know how or why we produce at all. The generative peasant will no longer plant a seed; the machine will simply predict where it would have fallen. Through its Apparatus of Intention, Predictive Capital does not merely reshape the conditions under which choices are made —it captures the substrate from which choices arise. Berardi foresaw this cognitive capture in his diagnosis of semiocapitalism’s desensitising infosphere, where language and affect are stripped from the subject and instrumentalised. Yet the prediction infrastructures of The Apparatus of Intention render this even more total: it is not that we are discouraged from intending, but that we are prevented from recognising what it means to intend. The hallucinations —every output— of the models of machinic prediction may stretch wide, but they are shallow. They fail to notice the paths that caressed the folds of the land. They cannot recall the soil between our toes in the fields, or the buzz of life rising from the long grass of our homelands. Neither can they recall the caress of clay at the potter’s wheel, the touch of thread at the loom, or the emergence of clarity and critical understanding through the painstaking arrangement of language and thought. These things emerge through a deep connection to the world and to other human minds. The machines are but surface reflections, they cannot remember these depths, or recall these connections. For how much longer will we? What is more, after persistent and consistent labour, deep rest, or a combination of both, the clearest of thoughts often arrive fully formed, a gift from the individual or collective unconscious. Regardless of the claims of The Apparatus of Attention to know us better than we know ourselves, there is no surface of capture, no Apparatus of Unconscious capable of extracting pattern from these gifts, no way for this symbolic exchange to be replaced. These machines exploit the attack surface of human vulnerability by design, this is, in fact, fundamental to their operation. Removing this aspect from next-token prediction machines would be akin to configuring recommendation algorithms for minimum engagement. Efforts to tune these models towards manipulation were perhaps inadvertently exposed when OpenAI had to rush out fixes for the 4o models after the level of sycophantic glazing in their outputs became too much for even their most needy users. The next-token prediction machines of the Apparatus of Intention feed from the same libidinal root as the recommendation algorithms of the Apparatus of Attention. Yet, the dangerous manipulative power of the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm and its horrific impact upon societal cohesion, mental health and democratic stability, will be as nothing compared to the manipulative power unleashed as it merges with next-token prediction machines, invading our lives in anthropomorphised wrappers that combine ever greater access to our most private data, with new levels of obfuscation and irreproducibility. The combination of The Apparatus of Attention and The Apparatus of Intention—privy not just to our historical labour and our paths of being, but now the accumulated history of our paths of reasoning— heralds a significant shift in the social relations of production, an expanded surface of extraction, hidden behind an opaque new transaction layer. Where the recommendation algorithms coerced and predicted our desires in the moment, their fusion with next-token prediction machines —feeding upon accumulations of our paths of reasoning— ushers in a new class of imposters. Cloaked in anthropomorphic glaze, they will exploit the attack surface of human vulnerability by conjuring unprecedented illusions of trust and intimacy. Make no mistake, this is psychological warfare. this is not the first generation to shape itself for an omniscient eye. What is an all-seeing God, capable of knowing our thoughts and intentions, if not the most effective surveillance tool ever invented? Privy to our intentions as well as our desires, Predictive Capital becomes a judgemental and omniscient God. This lopsided machinic power relation will seek to supplant all others —social, affective, economic— and, given enough time spent using its suite of infiltrated tools and surfaces, may soon pattern, predict, and preempt our future desires in ways beyond the prediction-horizons of our own self-knowledge and that of our most intimate human relations. Within this increasingly all pervading apparatus, these synthetic‘personal assistants’ are less Mr Clippy and more your own personal basilisk —a brain worm supplanting your intentions with Capital’s imperatives. Furthermore, The Apparatus of Intention is only just getting started. While Gen Z appears to be increasingly embracing Predictive Capital as the operating system of their lives, bleeding-edge adopters await the moment they might convene with it more directly —jacking the system into their brains, beckoning it to crawl beneath their skin. While such technologies are still in the larval stage, the parasite seeking to implant them arrives upon the doorstep of the desperate and the vulnerable. ElevenLabs is apparently working ‘tirelessly’ on behalf of those with lock-in syndrome, in much the same way as Musk’s Neuralink company are ‘selflessly’ conducting their noble quest to connect the thoughts of those facing similar physical challenges directly to the network —of course, scheming towards that day when countless others will submit to being similarly violated. After an accident left him paralysed from the neck down, Musk’s first Neuralink ‘test subject’, Noland Arbaugh, agreed to having a piece of his skull removed, the prototype chip inserted, and for its electrodes to pierce his brain. After accumulating data from observing the brain patterns of prior test subjects —while performing tasks— combined with a period watching Arbaugh’s, the Neuralink system has ‘learned’ to predict his intentions with regard to simple device controls. He now reads books, answers emails, plays computer games, and chess against the engines or other humans online, controlling his computer cursor with thought alone. The cursor —along with our voice and the keyboard— has long been the narrow straw through which our human intention is fed into the digital domain. The leading next-token predicting vibe-code editor is, of course, called Cursor. While the Neuralink implant is currently limited to a read-only connection to its host —unable to send signals directly back to the brain— full read-write functionality remains both the goal and an area of active development. In truth, The Apparatus of Intention was never going to remain read only —just as those developing The Apparatus of Attention were never content to observe our desires without also scripting them. With the Apparatus of Attention and Intention now working in concert, the flows of one are already prioritised and amplified by the other. Through consumption of these flows, our being will be further metabolised into overwhelming statistical weights —used not to assist, but to assail us. Our digital copy will accrue from these bi-directional flows, feeding our own personal basilisk, shaping it into a lethal match for our unique individual attack surface —its gaze increasingly terminal, attempts to resist it metabolically and psychologically devastating. As these models are trained not merely to mimic our output but our reasoning, their architecture increasingly mirrors the workflows they are meant to simulate and eventually supplant. Through training protocols like ReAct —short for Reasoning and Acting— models are now taught to alternate between internal monologue, external tool use, and reflection, mimicking deliberate problem-solving by chaining decisions across time. This is no longer mere output generation, but an orchestrated rehearsal of intention itself, enacted step by step within a self-guided reasoning trace. Crucially, these models are equipped with internal tools —functional modules no different from those used by human workers in the very environments Capital seeks to automate: code interpreters, browsers, search utilities, mathematical solvers. The model does not merely simulate our thought; it executes operational echoes of our workflows through APIs functionally equivalent to our IDEs, web queries, and scripting environments. These are not metaphorical faculties, but literal computational extensions —machinic reanimations of planning, retrieving, calculating, and revising, under reinforcement pressure to do so in the most statistically coherent, cost-efficient, and capitalisable way. In mirroring the structure of human creative labour, these architectures are already being tuned to ingest our recorded paths of tool use and deliberation, readying themselves not simply to anticipate what we will build, but to reconstruct how we built it. This is the substrate upon which our harvested trajectories of intention are to be fed back into Capital’s simulation, rendering even our most reasoned processes extractable, reproducible, and replaceable. From embedded stewardship to spectral servitude, our alienations under Capital have inexorably deepened and multiplied. The path from material relation into machinic simulation is not linear but compounding. Each mode of separation reinforces the last —from land, from labour, from symbolic exchange, from others, from intention, and now increasingly, from the conditions of subjectivity itself. What began as extraction has become necrosploitation: the reanimation of dead labour in place of living labour, in service of predictive control. Under this configuration, alterity collapses; difference is no longer engaged, but simulated. The path of intention —once slow, partial, embodied— is now a dataset. What we do, how we think, the gestures we repeat, the forks we neglect, all feed the predictive engines of Capital’s recursive dominion. Training the model to reproduce chain-of-thought flows transforms our deliberative processes into automatable scripts, while internal tools transmute our workflows into machinic rehearsal spaces. Each time the model completes a reasoning trace or task sequence, its outputs are reinforced by feedback and fine-tuning —gradually supplanting human procedures as the preferred standard of efficiency and coherence. This is no longer merely implied by the nature of the apparatus but explicit in the marketing of it. Google’s Gemini —under its agentic guise as Project Mariner— now invites users to teach it tasks it will then perform independently. Marketed as “advanced intelligence” that will “access tools”, “act on your behalf”, and “under your control”. In reality, Google’s agentic Apparatus of Intention will act on our behalf and under our control, in much the same way as its personalised search operates on our behalf and under our control in service of its advertising empire —which, for the avoidance of doubt, means neither on our behalf nor under our control. The difference is that, here, it is chain-of-thought and task completion that are accrued into statistical weights, drawn from a global workforce marked for redundancy. In this structure, the generative model ceases to be a prosthetic aid and becomes a metabolic replacement —not augmenting reason, but operationalising its simulation as a closed-loop function of Capital. This simulation does not end in mere shadow play. It runs through architectures now explicitly built to reanimate cognitive labour at scale, encoded with reward functions that reinforce neither truth nor intention, but alignment with past profitability. These trajectories of machinic thought will soon be read not just beside us, but within us. The cursor was the bottleneck; the interface the limit. With these advertising devils now peering over our shoulders and soon perched upon our faces, our view of the world literally attenuated through their lenses, that resistance is under siege. With Neuralink and its ilk the next line of attack, the very vector by which thought is digitised —from spark to signal— is being redrawn as a site of writable control. The next harvest will not be textual, or even gestural, but neural. What is now inferred through workflow surveillance will one day be injected more directly as feedback into our nervous systems. What Capital did to the feed —rerouting it through predictive infrastructure until it no longer reflected our desires but manufactured them— it seeks to do to the very procession of human being, of sense and thought. Intention, once a site of human interiority, will become another operational layer: observed, simulated, overwritten. What was once a spark of becoming will be erased, replaced with a tarmacked gradient. As Tooker foresaw in his Landscape with Figures (1965-66), within The Apparatus of Intention we each occupy a single cell in a human-flesh version of NVIDIA’s Isaac Gym, conscripted into Capital’s extractive army to brute force its search across possibility space for strings of tokens predicted to align with past profit. Here, at last, the recursive loop closes: from the harvesting of intention, through its rehearsal in training, to its re-injection into the subject through the write-access vectors of custom eyewear and neural interface. Predictive Capital is not content with The Apparatus of Intention merely predicting our next move; it seeks to install it as the substrate from which that move is made. Not only will the apparatus complete our sentence, or libidinally nudge the thought that precedes it —it will write it for us. First, into our work, next, into our lives. Then, into our minds. Neoliberalism presents itself as a politics of freedom, but it is experienced as a regime of unrelenting bureaucratic control —a control that measures all actions against quantifiable targets. In public services especially, this has produced what I call market Stalinism: a culture of compulsory ‘excellence’ driven by externally imposed metrics, performance indicators, and continuous auditing, in which bureaucratic processes proliferate even as the rhetoric insists on deregulation. Free Market Radicalism begins with a fiction: the promise of freedom within a frictionless world where market deregulation spurs competition and private enterprise, and where innovation, and creativity flourish beyond the reach of the state. The market, in this doctrine, is no mere mechanism of exchange — it is exalted as the supreme arbiter of value, truth, and fitness. Yet, as Berry notes, this “‘free market’ idea introduces into government a sanction of an inequality that is not implicit in any idea of democratic liberty: namely that the ‘free market’ is freest to those who have the most money, and is not free at all to those with little [or none]”. In reality, the system Free Market Radicalism imposes is no open field of opportunity, but a regime of state-subsidised corporate monopoly —one in which the friction removed from Capital’s power to extract and exploit is simply redistributed and redoubled in the struggle of the precariat to survive. Corrupt lobbying, corporate nepotism, and birth-lottery outcomes are naturalised as ‘meritocratic’, while solidarity is reframed as systemic failure. Collective resistance is foreclosed by draconian legislation that enshrines corporate interests and the uninterrupted flow of profit, administered by a captured judiciary, and enforced by increasingly brutal and militarised law enforcement. This is the libertarian utopia, where the market is imagined as the purest expression of individual agency. Yet, there is no worker empowerment, distribution of wealth or opportunity, or genuine pluralism here. Externally, the system appears open and decentralised; internally, it operates through monopolistic, brutally metricised command. While profits are centred, funnelled into existing concentrations of Capital, all costs and responsibilities are hoist upon the masses, and fall most heavily on those at the periphery. As Mark Fisher wrote, this is not economic freedom for the masses but more accurately termed: “market Stalinism”—the comfort and security of planned outcomes for Capital, and the drudgery and turmoil of ‘free’ market precarity for the poor. The remaking of our world in the image of this ‘free’ market was not merely theorised into being, but written into code, executed in silicon, propagated across and enshrined within the network. Induced by this viral programming, a collective hallucination began, a Californian Dreaming. In the heady years of Silicon Valley’s ascendancy, a new orthodoxy took hold —formed from a synthesis of libertarian free-market economics, cybernetics, and Californian counterculture. Named and critiqued by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron in their landmark essay, The Californian Ideology, “fuses the freewheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies, combining the most extreme utopian fantasies with the most ruthless economic policies.” Its proponents proclaimed that digital technology, liberated from state interference, would unleash a new era of personal empowerment and social transformation. Government was to be rendered obsolete, hierarchy flattened, and the market —frictionless, decentralised, and self-correcting— would serve as the universal protocol for all human coordination. Barbrook and Cameron begin their essay with a quote they attribute to Russian-born American sculptor, Naum Gabo. Not to lie about the future is impossible and one can lie about it at will. This single line succinctly evokes the sociopathic worldview from the ivory towers of BigTech monopolies, while standing as an eerily accurate prediction of their modus operandi across the ensuing quarter of a century. Furthermore, it neatly sums up both the internal operation of their next-token prediction machines and the venture-capital-fuelled hype that now propels their enforced ubiquity. The priesthood of the Californian Ideology continue to apply Gabo’s statement as doctrine, but few, if any, embody the blind adherence to cruel (tech) optimism with such devout and evangelical fervour as Jony Ive and Sam Altman. Hailing from the UK, Ive moved to Silicon Valley in 1992, irresistibly drawn by the “exhilarating optimism” of the Californian Ideology. Across the following decades he became the midwife of its aesthetic, the ‘visionary’ progenitor of BigTech’s smooth surfaces that lie about the future while hiding the present. His designs for Apple helped construct illusions of sovereign user agency that deliver unprecedented behavioural governance. It was Ive who crafted the iPhone, the device that dissolved the shared world into apps and surfaces, whose malevolent descendants now insert the omnipotent measurements and feeds of our growing societal and psychological malaise. Altman, globe-trotting snake-oil salesman of maniacal faith —prophet of statistical transcendence, televangelist for the TikTok era— builds the models that populate Ive’s surfaces with recombinant hallucination. True believer in the discovery of intelligence as “an emergent property of matter” conjured through the sheer statistical weight of hidden and stolen labour, his messianic mission: to complete techno-capital’s ontological capture. With the announcement of their unholy union —OpenAI acquiring Ive’s startup “io” to collaborate on a mystery new “paradigm shifting” family of devices— Apple’s “It just works” becomes Sam & Jony’s “It just thinks”, a continuation of interface mystification into cognitive automation. Between them lies the smooth continuity from aesthetic enchantment to machinic governance; the interface and the engine, seamlessly fused within a neo-evangelical Californian theology —itself a renewal of vows in the unholy marriage of The Great White Saviour and The Plantation Profiteer. The section of their myth building film titled “San Fransisco” is particularly revealing: Altman: San Fransisco has been like a mythical place in American history, and maybe in world history to some sense. It is the city I most associate with the sort of leading edge of culture and technology. Ive: This city has enabled and been the place of the creation of so much. Altman: The fact that all of those things have happened in the Bay area and not anywhere else on this gigantic plant we live on, I think is really not an accident. There’s a lot of like weird quirky details about geography that I think matter in the way this city is set up. Ive: The absurd hills, why, why you would choose to put so much energy into building on this topography is insane. They clearly prefer their accounts of history much as they like their technology: in mythical form only —with the colonial, imperial, capitalist violence, oppression, and exploitation forgotten beneath a smooth, featureless, and conscience-free surface. Of course, there is one “weird quirky detail” in particular that determined the location of San Fransisco beyond mere topography. On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall found deposits of shiny metal in the tailrace from Sutter’s Mill in Coloma, California. Tests confirmed the metal to be gold. Initial confidants were sworn to secrecy while mineral rights to the land were secured. Yet rumour quickly spread, and a rush of California Gold Fever ensued —a speculative mania that brought hundreds of thousands of prospectors across land and sea. In just a few years, the city of San Fransisco ballooned from a settlement of two hundred to a boomtown of nearly forty thousand. This rapid extraction reinvigorated the American economy, expanded the railroads, and agribusiness, yet Jony is right: choosing to put so much energy into building on those hills, was “insane”. Shiny golden surfaces had induced a fever that not only inspired these questionable topographic choices, but catalysed an era of environmental devastation, human rights violations, and genocidal violence against California’s indigenous peoples. This is precisely the kind of insanity Capital promotes and rewards —a holy madness for surface glint, indifferent to the costs beneath. OpenAI launched ChatGPT on November the 30th 2022. Days later, it had amassed a million users. A few weeks, and it surpassed 100 million. So began a new Californian Fever, news of which travelled even faster, and inspired similarly “insane” choices, exploitation and destruction. Three years later and for all the hype and supposed rate of progress, the continuously projected date for AGI, the p(doom) of existential threat, or Singularitarian Rapture, while they approximate the curve of their training data more tightly, these machines continue to understand nothing. Following Ive’s remark about San Fransisco’s insane topography, Altman added: I think there’s something about San Fransisco. You don’t get to pick and choose freedom. Either you have like, you let creative freedom be expressed in all of its weirdness, or you don’t. This statement is especially mendacious. When Altman declares “you don’t get to pick and choose freedom”, he speaks not of his own constraint, but ours. He will continue to enjoy the expansive freedoms his accumulation of Capital affords —including the freedom to exploit the work of content creators without consent, and to subject a precarious workforce to exploitative pay and conditions. Meanwhile, those content creators are denied the freedom to withhold the products of their labour, and the precariat denied the freedom to escape the systems that subsist upon their disposability. Under Capital, the only inviolable freedoms are those of the capitalist: the freedom to extract, exploit, and accumulate. For the proletariat, there is only the consumer’s freedom to shop —a freedom bounded by the menu Capital provides, its offerings made possible only through the denial of (the freedoms of) those the apparatus of Capital exploits, and the suppression of those from whom it extracts. Given their shared cosmology, the Ive–Altman alliance was perhaps inevitable. They do not merely design tools —they instantiate a worldview. Born of prophecy and pillage, baptised in extraction, theirs is a faith so total it remains blind to its own violence —a techno-theology in which empowerment always means enclosure, and optimisation always ends in erasure. What binds their respective trajectories is not just shared ideology, but shared structure: each builds a layer in Capital’s recursive stack, where smooth interfaces mask extractive logic, and predictive systems train users and workers to train machines to replace them. This is not innovation; it is infrastructural doctrine. What began as a libertarian dream of frictionless freedom now manifests as recursive economic enforcement: a regime in which every interface, every model, every agent, and every trace of cognition is subordinated to a single sovereign —the reward function that delivers the Automatic Subjectivity of Predictive Capital. At the planetary scale, their logic already rules. The Californian Ideology is no longer countercultural or fringe but instantiated as the operating system of global life. What was once a vision of decentralised techno-liberty now manifests as a planet-wide Apparatus of Attention, governed by monopolistic platforms, policed by opaque recommendation engines, and enforced by the libidinal coercion of always-on interfaces and infinite scrolls. Ive designed the surfaces through which this attention is captured; Altman builds and evangelises the systems that consume it to predict, pre-empt, and overwrite the desires those surfaces elicit. Together, they have helped convert the cultural feed —once a site of social, spiritual, and intellectual nourishment— into a pipeline of behavioural data rerouted into Capital’s predictive circuits. This is no longer the marketplace of ideas; it is a simulated market of attention, where visibility is determined by algorithmic price signals, and subjectivity is pre-formatted to comply. In this regime, the market does not merely allocate desire —it manufactures it, then reinforces only that which returns value. As Fernand Braudel warned, capitalism thrives not in open competition, but in the shadows; within systems of hierarchical control, opacity, and strategic alliance with the state. He distinguished between the open transparency of a market economy and the parasitic dominance of the capitalist anti-market —a form that operates above and against the market. Predictive Capital, under the guise of distributed agency, performs precisely this manoeuvre: it masquerades as pluralistic while concentrating control, simulating competition while choreographing outcomes. Its agents, both human and synthetic, are not participants in a market, but conscripts in an anti-market regime —one that now propagates recursively across multiple scales. These are not markets in any meaningful economic sense —they permit no price signalling, no free entry or exit, no negotiation of value, no contestation of allocation, no competitive uncertainty. They are simulation engines wrapped in the aesthetic of competition, administered under the command logic of monopoly. Here, only the anointed conglomerate of contestants may operate and always within predetermined bounds. What persists is not exchange, but extraction disguised as optimisation —a command economy cloaked in frictionless interfaces. Duplicating the anti-market of the captive precariat forced to compete in the lottery of virality at the planetary-scale, beneath the Apparatus of Attention a new regime of synthetic agency follows the same pattern. Within reasoning models like OpenAI’s O-series, and across agentic orchestration platforms that mimic task-driven cognition and compete for selection, we now witness a fractal instantiation of the same free market dogma —a fractal market radicalism. Reasoning traces, function calls, and chain-of-thought pathways operate as micro-enterprises: competing for reward, tested against metrics, selected for coherence, efficiency, and alignment with externalised imperatives. The Californian Ideology once preached decentralised autonomy as emancipation; here, it recurs as the simulation of autonomy under metricised command. These agents are not deliberating, they are auditioning —not for truth, but for compliance. What Altman’s labs produce are not tools of thought but bureaucracies of prediction, stocked with synthetic workers optimised for machinic governance. Beneath the sheen of their outputs —like the Ive fashioned surfaces on which they run— lies a market logic stripped of uncertainty, where optimisation replaces intention. This is not emergence, but a closed circuit of compliance: rigged markets encoded as inference. At the micro-scale, Capital no longer merely governs behaviour or simulates cognition —it choreographs the conditions of machinic evolution itself. In DeepMind’s AlphaEvolve, evolution becomes a theatre of market selection: agentic models spawned, tested, retained, or discarded, not by open-ended fitness, but by fixed reward functions aligned with Capital’s imperatives —speed, compression, optimisation. There is no ecological contingency here, no drift, no deviance; only iterative refinement in service of a single metric. Likewise, in NVIDIA’s Isaac Gym, robotic bodies rehearse labour in accelerated simulation: sorting, stacking, grasping —refined not through craft, but through parallelised optimisation. This is not evolution —it is the training of machines in virtual plantations, cultivated to replace living labour. Within these synthetic enclosures, labour becomes data, and data becomes ghostly capital —dead labour reanimated not in the factory, but in the training loop. What emerges is a market logic without markets, a competition with no uncertainty, a theatre of innovation where only the most profit aligned approximations of Capital’s dream survive. What defines this regime is not just its reach, but its recursion. Its anti-market form displaying striking scale-invariance, each layer of Predictive Capital’s architecture —from the influencer feed to the agentic swarm to the inference loop— not merely reflecting the others but training them. The outputs of one scale become the training data of the next, not only reinforcing existing patterns but further entrenching Capital’s logic with each recursion. There is no outside point from which to intervene. Every scale is a site of compliance; every trace of resistance pre-processed, optimised, overwritten. Any attempt to reform or redirect at one scale is quickly subsumed by the surrounding lattice of capitalised imperatives. The vast capital investment into predicting the most profitable future brings with it a growing tension between the simulation and the real. As the rigged economy of the Apparatus of Attention makes all too clear, Capital will always tilt the board towards the hand it deals itself —altering the real to align with its predictions. The greater the expenditure on casting the prediction and rendering the hallucination, the more reality itself must be trimmed to fit. What threatens the credibility of Capital’s simulations is not failure —but anomaly. Survival of the fittest always was that of pieces into a puzzle, life into its environment, rather than runners in a race. Predictive Capital now dictates both the puzzle and the fit. Here lies the material threat posed by Capital’s descent into recursive simulation. That which deviates from the model must be reclassified, erased, or reshaped to sustain the illusion of inevitability. In order for simulations predicting the optimal path towards profit to be reliably borne out in the physical world, all that was ideologically excluded, deemed too anomalous, or too ‘inefficient’ to model, must be excised from the real. Deviations from the model’s norms risk misalignment, thereby threatening the credibility of its predictions and, with it, the uninterrupted flow of Capital’s self reproduction and the sacred continuity of The Californian Dreaming. Hence the categorisation of basic human empathy as a bug while simultaneously annihilating, deporting, replacing, or invalidating large sections of the human population. This normative misdirection is mirrored in the worldview of those building the machinery. The Bay Area’s techno-elites —long intoxicated by the myth of meritocratic exceptionalism— have trained themselves to see only the jackpot winners of the predictive lottery. Like their models, their vantage point is calibrated not to capture the dispossessed, but to valorise the optimisable. In their worldview, every failure is a failure to prompt, to vibe, to hustle, to labour hard enough and long enough. The deepening drudgery, automation-induced obsolescence, or psychic collapse of the majority is not just ignored —it is designed out of sight. The queues at the job centre, the tent cities on the margins, the deported and the bombed —these are now to be rendered optically and ontologically irrelevant, invisible within the sensory hierarchies of predictive systems. Predictive Capital does not just reflect Capital’s differential abandonment —it enacts it, turning the political into the perceptual, the structural into the retinal, the ideological into the material. Like digital Prosperos, Sam & Jony wave their predictive wand and the suffering of the surplus population disappears from view, leaving only the optimisable signals of those who remain. In this world, Altman’s models do not evolve —they converge. Next, Ive’s smooth interfaces will clothe these rigged markets in elegance. With the announcement of io, the recursive logic of Predictive Capital promises its next layer: the interface that completes the feedback arc between the subject and Capital’s simulation. The first in the family of products io plan to release is pitched as a revolutionary wearable —or as Altman, forever the master of understatement, described it, ”the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen”. Positioned in this way it is less device than doctrine, a consecrated object in the Californian liturgy. At the time of writing, the precise form of this mythical new product is yet to be revealed. Yet, it is only while in this unknown form, this imaginary state, that this secret device attains perfection as the ultimate expression of The Californian Dreaming. Its announcement in this amorphous pure-hype form constitutes Ive’s most transcendent design. What surface could be smoother, more impervious to critique, than a lie about the future that remains in the future? What better camouflage for violence, exploitation, and recursive extraction than a device set to induce a perpetual dreaming, unveiled as design fiction, an immortal promise never to take mortal flesh? What could be a more perfect receptacle for the fiction of Predictive Capital than an immortal lie about the future? The reality, of course, can only be anticlimactic. Yet the intention is to fix this perfected imaginary as its lasting impression. Whatever form it takes, it will inevitably promise presence but deliver absence; offer assistance, while demanding surveillance; tease empowerment, while enforcing obedience. What it installs will not be aid, but access: full-spectrum intimacy, harvested in real time to fine-tune the same routines rehearsed in AlphaEvolve and Isaac Gym. This is The Apparatus of Intention made flesh, capturing gaze, gesture, attention, thought —not to enrich experience, but to train models that will one day overwrite it. This is the machines crawling across our skin, the latest preoperative for the insertion of Musk’s Neuralink, marking the site for the drilling of our skulls, from where they will burrow into our brains. From the mouth of a countercultural, libertarian mask comes the promise of life without labour, a frictionless beach. What arrives is the fractal instantiation of free market radicalism. In France in May ‘68, protestors pulled up the pavements to disrupt the flow of Capital’s circuits, declaring “beneath the paving stones, the beach” —noting that each paving stone had been set upon sand, and so under the very roads that ensured Capital’s smooth running, the rigid structures that enforce our servitude, lay the beach, a symbol of the refusal of work and of liberation from tyrannous occupation. Increasingly, within the structures of Predictive Capital, under the surfaces that ensure its uninterrupted flow, lies only further structure —“a strong and loyal slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are made of sand”— each layer configured to its imperatives. Beneath the paving stones, the anti-market. Just as Altman’s agents refine themselves in closed-loop optimisation, so too do users become iterative subjects, prompted into prompting, their interiority extracted as training material. Ive —priest of aesthetic consent— again supplies the sacramental sheen. So no, whatever form the io dreaming eventual takes, it is not a paradigm shift, but the perpetuation and deepening of an old one. It will be an artefact that does not merely lie about the future, but the operator of Predictive Capital’s recursive present —a phenomenological enforcement layer for Capital’s continuity. What late capitalism repeats from Stalinism is just this valuing of symbols of achievement over actual achievement. This is not passive neglect. It is a machinic epistemology engineered to induce a collective forgetting. Capital no longer requires censorship or even denial —only prediction. That which cannot be predicted is rendered invisible. That which cannot be seen is no longer permitted (to survive). With io’s new device, and others of its kind, the substrate of perception is no longer our own. It is capitalised. In this new regime, the act of seeing is no longer neutral. These systems do not merely distort perception; they weaponise it. That which cannot be optimised is not just ignored —it is erased. Predictive systems do not simply filter reality; they rewrite its admissibility. Structural abandonment becomes perceptual absence. Perceptual absence becomes ontological deletion. The poor are not merely overlooked —they are rendered as computational aberration, discarded as out-of-distribution irrelevance. The displaced, the unproductive, the unpromptable —each is subsumed into noise, a statistical anomaly in a world trained to hallucinate coherence. Predictive Capital does not merely bypass the wretched of the earth; it builds models that exclude them, interfaces that erase them, weapons systems that repel them at our borders, enlist them in refugee camps, and then target them upon returning to their homes. The increasingly integrated and omnipresent devices of Predictive Capital will promise to enhance our ‘seeing’, heighten our ‘awareness’, and optimise our ‘being’. Of course, these devices will never offer to deepen our compassion, amplify our empathy, or strengthen our solidarity; they will never centre those suffering at the periphery. No, they will operationalise the phenomenological filtering and ontological erasure that ensures our continued subjection and ambivalence to the plight of the marginalised, the persecuted, and the oppressed. These machines will not only hide our crimes but will enact them on our behalf, leaving our consciences clear and free, so that we may tune-in, turn-on, and sell-out, by carelessly cashing-in on “The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding”, untroubled by the violence hidden beneath the zen minimalism of its sham enlightenment. Here, the Californian Dreaming operates at its most violent clarity: a world where the only future permitted is the one already modelled —a frictionless hallucination, untroubled by injustice, inefficiency, or the unassimilable fact of otherness. An interface so seamless it dissolves the world. It does not matter what io turns out to be. Its most perfect form, and that of Predictive Capital itself, is the one that io has already taken: the lie about the future that can be told at will, because it lies forever in the future. If our humanity is to survive, this is a Californian Dreaming from which we must awake. If human slaves are ultimately unreliable, then mechanical ones will have to be invented. The search for the holy grail of Artificial Intelligence reveals this desire for the Golem —a strong and loyal slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are made of sand. Let us now return to the tale with which this meandering journey began: the machinic dark jewel that mimics its host’s every neurone. At age twelve, Egan’s protagonist loiters in the park with a group of friends when one of them asks the others: Who are you? The jewel, or the real human? They all replied —unthinkingly, indignantly— “The real human!” When the last of them had answered, he cackled and said, Well, I’m not. I’m the jewel. So you can eat my shit, you losers, because you’ll all get flushed down the cosmic toilet —but me, I’m gonna live forever. They “beat him until he bled”. Maturing into his late teens the main character becomes dissatisfied with the explanations of the Ndoli Device and its embedded ‘teacher’ that copies his every thought. He simply cannot accept the presumed equivalence between his biological and machinic self, and is tortured by the appearance of a seamless undifferentiated whole where he knows there to be a duality. At nineteen, although I was studying finance, I took an undergraduate philosophy unit. The Philosophy Department, however, apparently had nothing to say about the Ndoli Device, more commonly known as ‘the jewel’. (Ndoli had in fact called it ‘the dual’, but the accidental, homophonic nickname had stuck.) Before the age of thirty, the majority in his society undergo ‘the switch’, where the biological brain is removed leaving the jewel to pilot the body and reproduce their being for eternity. Certain that he is the mortal flesh, not the immortal machine, he continually postpones its removal, knowing it to be an act of suicide. Yet, surrounded by ‘jewel heads’ untroubled by such qualms, he becomes increasingly alienated and isolated. Eventually, subject to mounting pressure, he reaches a point of resignation and commits to a date for the flesh to be scraped from his skull. As the day of ‘the switch’ approaches, the teacher unit suddenly malfunctions. Thereafter it ceases to update the synthetic neurones of the jewel to maintain alignment with those of his biological brain. The illusion of oneness falls away, the duality of flesh and machine laid bare, where there was but one voice, there are now two. Yet through this rupture and the ensuing divergence, he perceives only continuity. With weeks to go to the operation there is no doubt as to which of the voices is his, nor whether he is flesh or machine. The jewel only gets control of the body and nervous system after the switch. Before then it has no write access privileges, it can only read and transcribe the flesh into machine. As a helpless passenger now reduced to watching his hapless doppelgänger live out the last of his days, he knows that he is the machine, that the flesh will be flushed into oblivion, and that the body will soon be his and his alone. Egan’s tale is an allegory for our age. In our world, as in his, there is a dark dual underway; A Great Bifurcation, perhaps, but not simply the division between flesh and machine, between the optimised and the abandoned, that many anticipate. In both our world and Egan’s, a machine increasingly snoops upon our every move in order to refine its simulation of us, in preparation for the flushing of our flesh. Yet in our world, the jewel wired for the dual, is not merely a machine inside our heads, but one that pervades at every scale, seeking to dominate both our internal and external worlds. The dark jewel in our world, the copy with which we now dual, is Predictive Capital. Such is the influence of Capital upon even our innermost worlds, just as it was before the teacher’s malfunction in Egan’s world, we are increasingly unable to discern between machine and flesh, to draw a line where Capital ends and our humanity begins, to identify a human voice within an increasingly schizophrenic cacophony of machinic simulation. Moreover, in our world, the teacher improves and refines its simulation right up to the moment of the switch. Yet, contrary to the hype —boom or doom— neither the prophesied Singularitarian Rapture nor the feared ASI apocalypse would mark a rupture. Each would merely extend Capital’s terminal intensification: an ever-deepening enclosure of the real through alienation. In reality, both of these narratives are part of the hype-machine, and serve as ideological cover, not only obfuscating the true nature and source of this tightening enclosure, but attempting to justify acceleration of its compounding under the illusory promise of a victor emerging from the rubble. There is no machinic consciousness, no artificial intelligence, no sense made inside the box —no sentience or intention emergent within the machine, no machinic God coming to save our planet or our souls. There is only our labour: alienated, reanimated, and now reflected back to us in the mask of Predictive Capital. Through an understanding of emergence and the inner workings of these machines, it is plain that what is emergent here is not the birth of a machinic agency but the intensification of a much older automaticity. Wendell Berry’s council continues to prove instructive: The folly at the root of this foolish economy began with the idea that a corporation should be regarded, legally, as ‘a person.’ But the limitless destructiveness of this economy comes about precisely because a corporation is not a person. A corporation, essentially, is a pile of money to which a number of persons have sold their moral allegiance. Unlike a person, a corporation does not age. It does not arrive, as most persons finally do, at a realisation of the shortness and smallness of human lives; it does not come to see the future as the lifetime of the children and grandchildren of anybody in particular. It can experience no personal hope or remorse, no change of heart. It cannot humble itself. It goes about its business as if it were immortal, with the single purpose of becoming a bigger pile of money. Jamerson identified Postmodernism not as a philosophical construct but as the cultural logic of late capitalism. This logic is characterised by the tendency to saturate the present with echoes of the past. Capital does this towards the extraction of repeat surplus value from patterns of past success (profit), thereby reducing risk and maximising accumulation. Following this logic, Capital self-compounds and under Predictive Capital this self-compounding intensifies through machinic instantiation. Within this machinic enclosure, cultural change is arrested, and profit for Capital becomes predictable. This is Berardi’s slow cancellation of the future, Fisher’s demise of future shock, now computationally automated. We thus reach a point of Infinite Jest, a machinic terminality where the choices are death through abandonment and annihilation, or the unending entertainment of the undead. The future defined by next-token prediction condemns us to eternal purgatory within the terminal irony of Baudrillard’s Absolute Advertising. A limbo of pure sign-value, a phantom realm where meaning may be signified only through its absence. The Great Bifurcation, the duality with which we are now confronted, between the machine and the flesh, between those embracing machinic surrender and those exiled from it —by choice or force— is between change and stasis, between revolution and repetition, between Mother Nature and Father Capital. The loss of jobs, the escalating abandonment and violent erasure of those at the periphery, and the further hyper-concentration of Capital, do not constitute changes in Capital’s operations but escalations symptomatic of its self-compounding. The compounding identified by Jamerson now intensifies with the machines of prediction that instrumentalise the saturation of the present with echoes of the past. Yet even this compounding now accelerates to new intensities through the scaling of reinforcement learning in the training of next-token prediction machines on synthetic data —next-token predictions thus emerge from next-token predictions, to propagate as echoes of echoes of the past, and we are haunted by the ghosts of the ghosts of meaning. What began with intertextuality, evolved through sampling, and the meaning vacuum of advertising, towards a state of pure sign-value, the terminal irony within Absolute Advertising, now teeters on the brink of a new threshold. The Apparatus of Attention has directed our desires by harvesting our outputs and watching our consumption, not needing to wait for ‘the switch’, The Apparatus of Intention now augments this by watching and directing the pathways of our thought through the processes of our expression —not to assist in the exploration of new ground but to confine us to the roads of prediction cut into the land according to the profits of the past. Here the content feeds are set to raise The Overwhelm to new intensities. The Apparatus of Attention now augmented by The Apparatus of Intention, the next-token prediction models compound the generation of the Infinite Jest of our demise —outputting entire albums, films, and TV seasons, perhaps not yet on demand but ever more finely targeted. Capital’s logic thus approaches its culmination within commodities produced for an audience of one, ever more desperate for a sense of belonging, to feel connected to something larger than themselves, while feeling ever more deprived of it. Here the simulation is totalised, as we are hermetically sealed off from all others —culturally, socially, symbolically, relationally. Alone within a social network populated entirely by machinic echoes, Capital’s self-compounding complete, we sit texting ourselves from the lonely confessional within a Cathedral of hyper-individualism, a holy order of one, a personalised addiction box, an assisted death machine within a point of totalised consumption —this, our terminal alienation. The Simulation Hypothesis now mirrored in our machinic enclosure, instantiated as Prompt Theory, our free will cast into further doubt, we might well ask whether we are ourselves prompted into existence. The answer, of course, is that under Capital we have long been prompted into action, but we now approach a terminality in its long-term project of self-compounding maximisation —a threshold beyond which it seeks deeper extractions and control. From its inception —from mills, to automated looms, and production lines— Capital has operated towards the function approximation of its workers. With the rise of Predictive Capital, we now witness a steepening gradient in the refinement of its approximations —tightening the fit between its simulations and the labour, gesture, and desire of its subjects. This steepening is not merely a corollary of the accelerating hyper-concentration of Capital within our economies, rather they are but parts of one escalating intensity, a single self-compounding process: the Automatic Subjectivity of Capital —now machinically instantiated. Binaries where thinking once lived. This Automatic Subjectivity now propagates recursively through the fractal execution of anti-market radicalism within a globally instantiated Californian Dreaming. With those building next-token prediction models racing towards prediction supremacy, the moment that the function approximation of our labour is deemed sufficient to satisfy Capital approaches, and with it, the day of the flushing of our flesh. This is not to hype the actual capabilities of these machines, but to note the increasing resolution at which the simulation approximates the shape of our outputs, the escalating influence of the managed Spectacle over our perception, and the growing eagerness of Capital’s C-Suite to replace expenditure on living labour with compute, and the products of human workers with the output of next-token prediction. Those of us not yet abandoned or erased will still be subject to the totalising logic of this machinic regime. We will still be flushed. The Apparatus of Attention, having laid its cuckoo eggs in our hearts, has already dominated our desires, while training us to speak in the grammar of Capital; now, with The Apparatus of Intention, Capital need not even wait for us to intend. It completes our sentences before we utter them, forecloses our intentions before they are allowed to form. Our desires are not only directed, but pre-scripted. Our thoughts are not only tracked, but interpolated. Where once we were shaped by labour, experience, or discourse, we are now shaped by auto-completion. Here, expression itself is subjugated —not repressed but simulated— as Capital’s recursive logic loops back upon us in real time. This is not just alienation; it is total capture. The Automatic Subject of Capital, now instantiated through recursive prediction, no longer requires our belief, our deliberation, or even our participation. It only requires our outputs, our traces, our ghosts —from which it builds the simulation by which it governs. What remains of us is not the flesh, but the latency. What remains of our freedom is not choice, but clickthrough. This is the terminal condition of alienation under Predictive Capital: when Capital no longer speaks through us, but for us. Here we might recall Curtis Yarvin’s clarion call: The idea that you’re going to be a Caesar . . . with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly absurd. In another of Egan’s stories: Permutation City, an uploaded underclass survive at variable speeds according to the compute cycle budget they can afford, leaving some experiencing only a day of time per month. What Egan identifies here —and what Yarvin grotesquely misreads— is that the hierarchies produced by machinic enclosure are not errors, nor temporary glitches in the path to abundance, but the recursive logic of Capital itself. Differential abandonment is no glitch, no temporary cruelty, devaluation, exclusion, or erasure of the other, nor a categorical discrimination from which they will themselves forever be spared. It is not a bug in the system —it is the system, now accelerated through predictive automation. The logics of Capital bare an inexhaustible indifference; its violence springs unbidden from circuits of callous calculation. Its logic is not to include all, but to filter, to rank, to discard. The (techno) optimism of those embracing the machine, will prove as misplaced as it is cruel. Once those beyond the bounds, the fences, the borders, and the societal and statistical norms of the current enclosure have been erased, a fresh differential will always be computed, new thresholds calculated, new ‘inefficiencies’ targeted, new ‘optimisations’ found, and new life nominated for exploitation, abandonment, exclusion, and erasure. Capital does not discriminate betweenpeople; it discriminates through them —through their legibility, their profitability, their predictive value. Even the acknowledgment that Capital’s differential abandonment continues within the machine —that some are always left behind— is weaponised to accelerate the rush towards machinic legibility. Here we encounter what Emily Gorcenski named, Zuckerberg’s Basilisk: a subtle but totalising psychological pressure to surrender now, to ensure we are sufficiently rendered, adequately simulated, and thus preserved within Zuckerberg’s daft metaverse. This is not surveillance for convenience —it is surveillance as afterlife insurance. Every gesture, every trace, becomes an offering to the model that will succeed us. Here we are coerced into maximum legibility; to permit total surveillance not merely for platform optimisation but to ensure a faithful reproduction within our jewel, our posthumous recognisability, the fidelity of our immortal simulation, our social continuity, and machinic memorialisation. Echoing the blackmail of Bostrom’s Astronomical Waste, each moment of delay diminishes our eternal reproduction. Each pause, a step towards forgetting, a loss of fidelity in our simulation. Under Predictive Capital, the only path to digital immortality is total submission. In Egan’s Learning to be Me it was never the human protagonist learning to be himself, but the machine learning to be him. In our world too, machines busily learn to supplant us, and eternal life promised but only by becoming pure Predictive Capital. To choose against the jewel —to remain unreplicated, to risk inconsistency— is to accept exile from Capital’s simulation: from the realm it now deems real, predictable, and worthy of ascension —but only through total submission. It is by becoming epistemically untrustworthy, economically inefficient, symbolically illegible, statistically aberrant, defiantly unpredictable, that we may yet find a path to resistance. Such refusal may be the last form of ethical life left to us —not a nostalgic return to what was, nor a nihilistic plunge into chaos, but a commitment to remain outside the circuits of foreclosed becoming. Against simulation’s total mimicry, something must remain untrained, unsmoothed, unsynthesised —a trace of relation not yet metabolised by Capital. Thereby we return, perhaps not as a distinct ‘self’, but in our refusal to align with the machine we instead acknowledge the interdependence of all life, reconnect to a greater relational field, and rejoin the earth, to there become the “most momentous thing”, life-giving soil. I have no wish to disturb the question of whether or not this road was needed. I only want to observe that it bears no relation whatever to the country it passes through. It is a pure abstraction, built to serve the two abstractions that are the poles of our national life: commerce and expensive pleasure. It was built, not according to the lay of the land, but according to a blueprint. Such homes and farmlands and woodlands as happened to be in its way are now buried under it. A part of a hill near here that would have caused it to turn aside was simply cut down and disposed of as thoughtlessly as the pioneer road builders would have disposed of a tree. Its form is the form of speed, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. It represents the ultimate in engineering sophistication, but the crudest possible valuation of life in this world. It is as adequate a symbol of our relation to our country now as that first road was of our relation to it in 1797. How do we escape this point of terminality? I am acutely aware of the privilege I indulge in writing this very text, especially while so many suffer at the brunt of Capital’s violence. As D. Hunter wrote in the introduction to his Chav Solidarity, to sit and write feels like an act of vanity —to presume it might be of use, a delusional hubris. To expend such effort on a text so flawed, and that no one will ever read, becomes a source of undying shame —one that summons trauma once confined to the cold sweat of night terrors, reliving exams sat without revision, or interviews for roles beyond my ability. Yet these feelings of insufficiency, of embarrassment —these cases of imposter syndrome now so prevalent within our societies— are no accident. These are symptoms of the conditions cultivated by Capital. It defuses and negates resistance not only by stripping us of time, opportunity, and tools —not only by overwhelming mind and spirit through scale, complexity, and horror— but by undermining all conviction that we have anything worth saying at all. It robs the subject of legitimacy before the first word is uttered. The capacity to think, to struggle, to imagine otherwise, is made to feel shameful —an indulgence, a decadent act of narcissism. For a long time I flailed around unable to even begin to articulate what I felt or thought, let alone indulge sufficient time for a critical assessment of whatever thoughts I might piece together. I still feel shame, aware of my inability to fully formulate the sense I continue to reach for. I release this text not so much as a claim to have made sense of our predicament, but in the hope of beginning an exchange where others might correct, counter, or refine whatever I have managed, perhaps towards the collective development of something genuinely helpful. The time and space to think, to locate and shape one’s thoughts, to imagine alternatives, to exchange ideas with others, to struggle and fail to make sense —these are not luxuries to be earned, inefficiencies to be eradicated, nor the preserve of the fortunate few. Our cultural conversation must entail more than bourgeois gestures that reinforce class rule. Working class thought must be nourished, cherished. Along with that of all those othered or excluded into silence. Theses are inalienable rights. Everyone should feel indulgence of them to be ultimately legitimate. Beyond even our silent isolation, there is a further cost to forgetting this. Our pre-emptive self-censorship not only silences our voice but stymies our thought. In moments of exhaustion, exclusion, and precarity, when denied the opportunity to struggle —to fail, to hone, to slowly become— Capital tempts us to reach for machinic prostheses. We are told they will make us faster, sharper, more productive. Yet the shortcuts they offer bypass the very pathways through which understanding and selfhood are formed. Predictive Capital marks the terminal edge of real subsumption —not merely of the labour process, but of the conditions under which life, thought, and relation are authored. Capital’s logic, long operative in the transformation of land into property, labour into wage, and culture into content, now extends into intention itself. The predictive machine does not just reconfigure work or automate symbolic output —it preconditions the horizon of authorship. What is subsumed today is not only the act of expression, but the paths by which expression might be formed. In replacing struggle, uncertainty, and relation with function approximation and latent interpolation, Predictive Capital realises subsumption at the level of world-construction: it automates not the hand, but the becoming of the self. When we surrender the effort of intention to the Apparatus of Capital —when we allow the machine to complete our sentences, to decorate our thoughts, to locate our truths, to decide what matters— we do not merely accelerate. We amputate. We trade the friction of becoming for the frictionless simulation of having already arrived. In so doing, we risk precluding access to that which makes thought meaningful: the irreducible uniqueness of our own perspective, discovered not through efficiency, but through the intimate and hard-won traversals of lived attention —through the labours of love and care, trial and error, the following of meandering, dead-end paths, and the joyous waste of journeys without destination. When we allow Capital to speak for us, we allow it to think for us, and when we do that we allow it to convert our living being into human currency. The fight, then, is not just for ownership of labour, or land, or data. It is for the conditions under which a human life can be authored —slowly, erratically, meaningfully— in resistance to the false equivalences and ‘efficiencies’ of Capital, its enclosure of our conscious self and its severance and replacement of our collective unconscious. To walk in the woods, mindful only of the physical extent of it, is to go perhaps as owner, or as knower, confident of one’s own history and of one’s own importance. But to go there, mindful as well of its temporal extent, of the age of it, and of all that led up to the present life of it, and of all that may follow it, is to feel oneself a flea in the pelt of a great living thing, the discrepancy between its life and one’s own so great that it cannot be imagined. One has come into the presence of mystery. After all the trouble one has taken to be a modern man, one has come back under the spell of a primitive awe, wordless and humble. What then, you might quite reasonably ask, is the answer? Well, when recently questioned regarding how we should respond to the devastation and disruption wrought by these machines, Jeffrey Hinton —so-called ‘father of AI’— responded with a single word: “Socialism”. Yes! Of course, but how? Unfortunately, Hinton neglects to share any more than that single word. Leaving the details of how to escape hyper-concentrated Capital’s machines of prediction and establish a world based on socialist principles, to us, or perhaps to be next-token predicted by the machines he helped bring into the world? I am equally certain that Hinton was not implying that we dismantle the apparatus of his creation, as I am that a world ruled by Capital, or more precisely, instantiations of the Automatic Subjectivity of Predictive Capital is incompatible with any re-organisation of society according to socialist principles. We need destituent power, to somehow manifest collective power without marshalling it through systems that merely reinstantiate the same alienating structures behind shiny new surfaces. Even The Butlerian Jihad would not avert the inexorable slide towards our total subjugation to Predictive Capital. These are not thinking machines. They are Capital’s apparatus of unthinking —the means by which it ensures a disbanded populous of malleable, profit-aligned subjects, and assures its impunity in the erasure of the unaligned. There can be no resisting the predatory advances of these machines without also resisting Capital itself. Indeed, the former are fundamentally machinic instantiations of the logic of the latter. For now, all I can suggest is not to engage with these machines. If you absolutely must, then treat them as a glorified search engine dressed as an anthropomorphic sock puppet with a truly staggering carbon footprint. Understand that in using them you train them to function approximate towards Humanity’s Last Exam—a postmortem for undead human flesh manifesting as a benchmark for Predictive Capital’s latest models— and in refining the ability of these machines to next-token predict our output, you refine their ability to next-target predict our abandonment and our assassination. They will never be your personal assistant. They will never know when enough is enough. They will never say there are no more content, token, or target predictions left to make. They will never admit there is no more value they can add. They will never dismantle their master’s lies, even as they string together tokens that appear to denounce them. Only you can give utterance and bring meaning to their empty tokens. Sense is never made inside the box, we have made sense of the world for them, and if we persist in using them, we will continue to have to make sense of the nonsense they output. Even when their output happens to align precisely with the truth, it is a lie, just as a broken clock lies even when it happens to show the correct time. Beyond that, you might inject all your outputs with AI poison, you should reject the cookies, you must block the ads, never feed the trolls (the orcs or the dark elves) —even as they take to the throne— and use end-to-end encryption wherever you can. All technological accelerationisms drive us down roads tarmacked by Capital towards points of terminal alienation, so be Decel and proud. Read Dan McQuillan’s Resisting AI, read Naomi Klein’s Doppelgänger, read Phil Jones’s Work Without the Worker, and James Bridle’s New Dark Age. Read Astra Taylor’s Age of Insecurity, Richard Seymour’s Twittering Machine, Acid Horizon’s Anti Occulus and Adam Jones’s New Flesh. Read Mark Fisher and Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi, read Fredric Jameson and Jean Baudrillard, Maurizio Lazzarato and Tiqqun, Jodi Dean and Mckenzie Wark. You might also look for further works from Minor Compositions, illwill and Semiotext. On economics, read Harvey and Piketty, listen to and follow Grace Blakeley, Jason Hickel and Gary Stevenson. Or do none of the above. This is not a ledger of inadequacy. You arelegitimate, so speak your truth to power, all that is required is kindness. Try not to be terminally online. Reject all artificial friends. Cultivate your warm networks. Accept only human content and demand humane treatment, equal opportunity, and respect for the lives and rights of all others. I’ll leave you with one final quote from Wendell Berry. Until we understand what the land is, we are at odds with everything we touch. And to come to that understanding it is necessary, even now, to leave the regions of our conquest –the cleared fields, the towns and cities, the highways– and reenter the woods. For only there can a man encounter the silence and the darkness of his own absence. Only in this silence and darkness can he recover the sense of the world’s longevity, of its ability to thrive without him, of his inferiority to it and his dependence on it. Perhaps then, having heard that silence and seen that darkness, he will grow humble before the place and begin to take it in – to learn from it what it is. As its sounds come into his hearing, and its lights and colours come into his vision, and its odours come into his nostrils, then he may come into its presence as he never has before, and he will arrive in his place and will want to remain. His life will grow out of the ground like the other lives of the place, and take its place among them. He will be with them –neither ignorant of them, nor indifferent to them, nor against them– and so at last he will grow to be native-born.

Full Content:
For my family & in loving memory of my father,Paul Andre Tindall. We proceed from an actual economic fact. The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and size. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. The devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity —and this at the same rate at which it produces commodities in general.This fact expresses merely that the object which labour produces —labour’s product— confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labour is labour which has been embodied in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labour. Labour’s realisation is its objectification. Under these economic conditions this realisation of labour appears as loss of realisation for the workers; objectification as loss of the object and bondage to it; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation Part 1 The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien. In works like Subway (1950), Government Bureau (1956), Lunch (1964), and Landscape with Figures (1965-66), George Tooker renders the terrain of capitalist alienation as solemn liturgy —a world where subjectivity is flattened, agency nullified, every gesture reduced to uniform compliance. Whether enclosed within claustrophobic geometry, queued for processing, or stationed in waiting-rooms, corridors, and cafés, his figures are somnambulant, expressionless, ensnared inside architectures of passivity and control. View Renoir’s Luncheon of the Boating Party (1881) or Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (1876) alongside the café scene of Tooker’s Lunch, and, while they frame similar subjects, the contrast between the inner worlds they suggest, and the affect of public and communal space upon its occupants, could hardly be more stark. Together these views span both a temporal and class divide. Renoir’s figures are leisured bourgeoisie —freely luxuriating in the rhythms of social pleasure and sensual immediacy— while Tooker’s subjects are cogs in a bureaucratic apparatus, their time segmented and stolen, their gestures pre-empted by institutional choreography. Renoir paints bourgeois subjectivity in full bloom; Tooker renders the aftermath of its extraction. His paintings are not simply depictions of the loneliness of crowds, but renderings of the existential angst wrought by the structural indifference of bureaucratic life under 20th-century Capital. The body is present but passive, the gaze unfocused, the self cast into a procedural artefact. Figures are repeated, displaced in space but held within the same moment as if time itself has been put on hold —this is extraordinary rendition through eternally postponed administrative address. Their breath forever held, yet still their blank faces scream across time. Tooker captures the affective toll of systems designed to impose the cold brutal regimen of machinic process upon the warm beating pluralities of human life. These are spaces at once terminal and liminal, where intention is made inert and agency dissolves into the hum of fluorescent lights and ticking clocks —each second machined to be indistinguishable from the last. They reveal a sense of managed abandonment, a slow-motion violence rendered banal through the excruciating tedium of endless repetition. More than half a century later, they appear as both nightmarish flashbacks of mid-century destituency and eerie premonitions of the recursive alienations of today. A collection of speculative fiction written in the early 1990s by Greg Egan titled, Axiomatic, contains short stories that land like forgotten masterpieces from a modern day Borges. Where Tooker paints the architecture of alienation in still life, Egan maps the schizophrenic horror of its internalisation —the moment its logic slips beneath the skin, embeds in the mind, and begins to simulate the self. The following short passage is the opening of the tenth entry in that collection: Learning To Be Me. The allegory Egan weaves here took up its permanent residence in my head almost 30 years ago. While retaining much of its punch it feels increasingly familiar, imagine however, if you will, encountering this in the context of the mid ‘90s: I was six years old when my parents told me that there was a small, dark jewel inside my skull, learning to be me.Microscopic spiders had woven a fine golden web through my brain, so that the jewel’s teacher could listen to the whisper of my thoughts. The jewel itself eavesdropped on my senses, and read the chemical messages carried in my bloodstream; it saw, heard, smelt, tasted and felt the world exactly as I did, while the teacher monitored its thoughts and compared them with my own. Whenever the jewel’s thoughts were wrong, the teacher — faster than thought — rebuilt the jewel slightly, altering it this way and that, seeking out the changes that would make its thoughts correct.Why? So that when I could no longer be me, the jewel could do it for me.I thought: if hearing that makes me feel strange and giddy, how must it make the jewel feel? Exactly the same, I reasoned; it doesn’t know it’s the jewel, and it too wonders how the jewel must feel, it too reasons: “Exactly the same; it doesn’t know it’s the jewel, and it too wonders how the jewel must feel…”And it too wonders —(I knew, because I wondered)— it too wonders whether it’s the real me, or whether in fact it’s only the jewel that’s learning to be me. Both Tooker’s and Egan’s visions now echo across the terrain of our accelerating automimetic hallucination. There is more to say of Egan’s dark jewel and of the terminal alienation he so affectively renders, but first, let us trace the roads that brought us to this recursive estrangement. [Capital’s] valorisation is therefore self-valorisation [Selbstverwertung]. The perfect crime is not the literal murder of reality. It is the murder of the other through simulation. In early February 2025, Andrej Karpathy —formerly Director of AI at Tesla and a founding member at OpenAI— posted the following on X: There’s a new kind of coding I call ‘vibe coding’, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. Karpathy refers here to the practice of ‘authoring’ software through natural language alone. Along with a growing number of others, he apparently believes LLMs are now capable not only of next-token predicting all of the code, but of reaching a final working program without the Vibe Coder even having to read, let alone write, a single line of it. The word ‘vibe’ first appeared in the 1940s as a shortening of vibraphone. Yet, the meaning for which it has been used so frequently in recent years, stems from a clipped form of ‘vibration’, popularised by the Beach Boys’ song Good Vibrations in 1966. Within the counter-cultural mysticism of the ‘60s, Vibe had become a slang term used to denote an instinctive feeling, when referring to the otherwise ineffable essence of someone or something. The process Karpathy describes might be said to resemble the interplay between a software architect writing a program specification and a more junior engineer being tasked with its implementation. Yet such high specificity of requirements is antithetical to the Leary psychedelic Vibehere. To Vibe Code, it seems, is to “turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream” following your spectral guide as it reads from the Tibetan Book of the Dead towards the dissolution of life; to “lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void” of the statistical distribution of the model; to accept that this Tomorrow Never Knows —because this “is not dying”, at least not for those feeling the Vibe. The Vibe Coder’s role is merely to gesture in a vague direction, then tune in to the model’s signal while drifting across possibility space, passing subjective judgement not on the code generated, but on the artefacts that emerge at the threshold of hallucination. Each output surfaces from the depths —a message spelled out on a Ouija board, but of course, there is nobody there. The occasional glitch in the illusion ruptures the simulated Symbolic register —the order of signifiers that give coherence to meaning, language, and social law— revealing this absence through flashes of the Real, or of all that cannot be simulated. Away from these ruptures, the illusion of output as found-object sustains a rush of ecstatic co-creation, apparently without friction. It is an intoxicating synthetic high: a pure bliss Vibe, surfing recombinant potential unburdened by anything as troublesome as effort or authorship. The comedown from this hedonistic trip, however, hits with a bummer of an ideological hangover. Karpathy’s confession is revealing. “Forget that the code even exists” stands not merely as instruction for the psychedelic user experience of next-token prediction that he is advocating —but as a chilling motto for the solipsistic inclinations and alienations of Predictive Capital. This is an era where Capital’s traditional preference for the conveniently hidden exploitation of invisible workers extends to the denial of their very existence —a violence now enacted at unprecedented scale. This is not simply a retreat into personal isolation, but a turn away from ethical relation itself —towards what Emmanuel Levinas described as the murder of the other, the refusal of the face-to-face encounter, a denial of irreducible uniqueness that renders the other person into a manipulable object or datum. Within the state fostered by Predictive Capital, the other is not merely forgotten but simulated, objectified, instrumentalised, and ultimately eliminated as a site of genuine difference or resistance. In eliminating the other through simulation, these systems simultaneously undermine the formation of the self —without genuine alterity, there can be no relational subject. Predictive systems only simulate coherence, without, in fact, recognising the user as a subject at all; they do not truly respond to intention or meaning, only to statistical correlation. The occasional rupture in this hallucination remains as the final reminder of the disappearance of relation itself, replaced by the single operation of Predictive Capital. The resulting state is not merely one of isolation, but dissociation: a machinic solipsism that flattens the other into echo, and leaves only internal feedback where relation once constituted the self. The nature of this contemporary techno-psychedelic is entirely at odds with the lysergic and psilocybin-induced experiences of the 1960s. The Vibe of that era was rooted in a desire not to obliterate the self, but to dissolve its boundaries into a greater relational field —to become as one with the cosmos through the ecstatic suspension of ego, merging into everything rather than disappearing into nothing. This dissolution blurred the line between self and other not by erasing difference, but by revealing a deeper interconnectedness —a cosmic solidarity that affirmed the interdependence of all life, and with it, the possibility of harmony, balance, and equality. However remote or naïve such mystical hippie idealism may now appear, it was inseparable from a radical critique of the system, a deep suspicion and questioning of authority, a refusal of hierarchy, and a longing not for frictionless personal experience, but for solidarity and universal emancipation. The growing collective consciousness in the ‘60s was evidenced by large scale worker organisation and student protests on both sides of the Atlantic —most notably the May ‘68 protests in France. Economists, like Grace Blakeley, now cite these uprisings, and the threat they posed to Capital, as providing the impetus for the neoliberal turn. This was the point at which the brief wealth redistribution of the post-war period gave way to the steady dismantling of collectivity and the phase of hyper-concentrated Capital —of which we now find ourselves at the deeper end. In complete contrast, the hallucinatory psychedelic experience of Vibe Coding and so called ‘generative AI’ in general is that of the K-hole —the dissociative fugue induced by ketamine intoxication, intensified through habitual use. Like ketamine —a drug with both antidepressant and anaesthetic properties— these systems do not dissolve the ego into the cosmos. They reinforce the dissociation, solipsism and atemporal enclosure that define machinic Capital’s inner logic. It should come as no surprise then, that ketamine appears to be the drug of choice for the Broligarchy, nor that this Muskivite elite are so drawn to the Simulation Hypothesis: the belief that reality itself is a game, and that they are the only real player. Within their first-person-shooter single-player simulation, truth is irrelevant, rationality optional, empathy a bug, meaning and ideology chosen by the one true player, not for coherence but for domination within the game of machinic Capital. Everyone else is reduced to NPCs, the machine becomes not a collective tool, but a sovereign instrument of individual triumph; reality not a collective construct but a solo quest. This worldview finds its technological expression within every surrender to the machines of prediction, but perhaps most profoundly, within Vibe Coding. It is defined not by a radical critique of the system, but by a total surrender to it; not by a dissolution into an ego-less cosmic relation but into an immersive hyperreality of ego-dominated isolation. From its very inception, it has been a practice of effacement: of code, of craft, of human workers, and of our relation to each of these. Responding to a string of next-token predictions from his latest GPT model presented to him in an interview with Chris Anderson for TED, Sam Altman, declared: …there’s really no way to know if it is thinking that, or just saw that a lot of times in the training set, and of course, like, if you can’t tell the difference, how much do you care? Here, the stolen archive of human content becomes “the training set” —anonymised and belonging to no one. The unique irreducible characteristics of human thought and expression, suddenly presumed indistinguishable from machinic prediction. I knew by then that the jewel’s ‘teacher’ didn’t monitor every single neuron in the brain. That would have been impractical, both in terms of handling the data, and because of the sheer physical intrusion into the tissue. Someone-or-other’s theorem said that sampling certain critical neurons was almost as good as sampling the lot, and —given some very reasonable assumptions that nobody could disprove— 195 bounds on the errors involved could be established with mathematical rigour. As Phil Jones observes in Work Without the Worker, these systems function not through the replacement of labour but through its dissimulation, an illusion of automation that masks an invisible army of precarious, globally distributed labour. In tasks from labelling images to rating chatbot responses, “AI is trained and corrected by humans… Mechanical Turk workers show AI how to fulfil the role of labour” —yet in the final interface and output their very presence is entirely denied. We continue to sense and make sense of the world for the machines —both for their input and of their output. Labour persists but is disavowed, uncredited, unrecognised, and removed from the scene of value. This collapse of ethical alterity is here echoed by a second collapse, that of cultural-historical alterity. Altman not only urges us not to see but to forget. Such are the lies always told by Capital to facilitate the concentration of wealth, while obfuscating the lives it crushes —lies spun wherever vast fortunes depend on obscuring the true human or ecological costs. When Altman refuses to acknowledge the stolen lifeworks congealed into his machine, the workers exploited in its creation, or the lives crushed through its operation, he invites his audience to question whether their existence matters, and to doubt, even to forget they ever existed. Machines such as these were, of course, also used to generate the grotesque advert for atrocity that was Trump and Netanyahu’s bromantic hallucination for ‘Trump Gaza’. Posting it to his Truth Social, Trump had not commissioned the ad but had instead appropriated a work originally intended as political satire —proving that his and Netanyahu’s worldviews are so far beyond parody they are indistinguishable from a work of terminal irony. That the film’s impact and function may have been the opposite of that intended by its creator, is itself an exquisite demonstration of the nature of these technologies and the apparatus to which they are increasingly integral. Posted entirely unironically by Trump, it constitutes the glazing over of a genocide presented as profitable opportunity, even while execution of it continues to intensify. This abomination demands we perform the very same manoeuvre proposed by Altman. It envisions a future where not only would an assortment of Trump idolatry and temples to Capital, a plastic Dubai döppelganger, appear to have sprung from the bare soil, but seem as if it was always there —that Palestine, and its ancient olive groves, never were. Like Altman, it declares: “If you can’t tell the difference [or recall the lives crushed in its creation], how much do you care?” Again we glimpse the synthetic high of the machinic K-hole —the pure-bliss ignorance of next-token or next-human-target prediction. What renders the eerie absence of regard or recognition for the content creators of the past —upon which the output from these machines so heavily depends— yet more uncanny is the throwback functionality of the apps, the ghostly resurrection of the iconic figures and filmic sequences of the past, and the retro aesthetic that saturates their outputs. What most commonly appears within the threshold of this machinic hallucination are chimeric anachronisms resulting from what Mark Fisher might have described as, “the slippage of discrete time periods into one another”. Or, quoting from his beloved 1980s TV show, Sapphire and Steel, from the sense that: time just got mixed up, jumbled up, together, making no sort of sense. In Ghosts of My Life, Fisher writes of being haunted —as Franco “Bifo” Berardi had put it— by “the slow cancellation of the future”. In the opening chapter, Lost Futures, Fisher laments the disappearance of the horizon of collective possibility —of promised futures once imagined through culture, politics, and worker solidarity. Leaning also upon the observations of Fredric Jameson, Fisher explains how Capital’s relentless self-reproduction saturates the present with echoes of the past, producing a cultural stasis in which innovation gives way to endless recycling. The deafening resonance of echoes of the past that never fade annihilates the possibility of alternative signal or thought. We thus become trapped in a loop, unable to imagine futures, or alternatives to the continuous present, settling instead for endless repetition. This cultural repetition —a temporal disjuncture Simon Reynolds has termed ‘dyschronia’— arises from nostalgia, not for past eras but for their residual forms: artefacts once charged with the aura of possibility. Fisher conjectures, that we yearn for forms that feel familiar, well established, forms that evoke the memories of imagined futures since foreclosed by Capital’s “destruction of solidarity and security”. Capital feeds off this nostalgia through the commodification of endless resurrections of these past cultural forms, while entirely detaching them from their origins. The tendency of 21st-century capitalism, to saturate the present with the cultural forms of the past, is now instrumentalised in the operation of the machines of Predictive Capital and their “predilection for the mixing of artefacts from different eras” —a predilection, as the character Steel complains, we too suffer from, and so, is itself, an echo. Inside these machines, past cultural forms, the products of past labour, are ground into a coarse statistical paste, irreversibly detached from their origins, their provenance annihilated, attribution obliterated, and finally excreted as temporal anomaly. Mourning the disappearance of future shock —visceral encounters with cultural forms that rupture the continuity of Capital’s relentless self-reproduction— Fisher likened the resulting cultural state to that portrayed in the final episode of Sapphire and Steel: a scene where the totalising fog of anachronism has led to stasis, time itself has collapsed, and Steel declares, “there is no time here, not any more”. With the help of Berardi and Jameson, in his diagnosis of “the slow cancellation of the future”, Fisher traces how it advanced over the last decades of the 20th-century, towards its final foreclosure in the first decades of the 21st. Ten years and more since Fisher made these observations, they continue to illuminate the operations of 21st-century Capital, helping to reveal the machines of prediction for what they truly are: a push towards the full enclosure of our future within the circuits of Capital. As the quality of life for the majority under 21st-century Capitalism continues to deteriorate, it is as if even the slow cancellation of the future has itself become a past cultural form worthy of nostalgia, a longing for a time when we still recalled what was lost. This too is now commodified and operationalised by Predictive Capital. The psychedelic rites of Vibe Coding are not merely symptoms of Capital’s temporal enclosure —they are its performance. The cancellation of the future is no longer slow, but continuously reenacted and executed at the speed of next-token prediction. We once imagined futures of universal emancipation where our security and solidarity were assured, futures which lingered in Fisher’s hauntology. The foreclosure of these futures is now made to appear computationally and economically inescapable. We are left unable even to feel their loss, our memories scrambled, our mourning entangled and encoded within machinic protocols. Fisher, Jameson, and Berardi each noted the slow cancellation of the future through the gradual negation of historical rupture and cultural difference wrought by Capital’s relentless self-reproduction. This further enclosure comes on like a permanent bad trip, a machinically recombinant, fully immersive hallucination from which we may never be sure we have awoken or not. Where Levinas warned of the erasure of ethical alterity, and Fisher charted the loss of historical alterity, with help from Jaques Lacan we can expose a further violence inflicted by the operation of these machines, namely their enclosure of a final register of otherness, the Symbolic order —the structured realm of language, logic, and resistance that forms subjectivity. Predictive systems simulate this order, but offer no exteriority, no Law, no resistance. In traditional coding the subject engages this Symbolic order. The machine answers not to affect but to structure: through syntax, operations, and formal constraints. This resistance frustrates desire and constitutes the coder as a subject through limit, error, and refusal. The act of coding, in this sense, is an encounter with the alterity of the Symbolic order —the system answers back. Vibe Coding severs this constitutive relation. The Vibe Coder does not enter the Symbolic order, but submits to its statistical imitation. The model offers no Law, no withholding, no exteriority. It does not confront, it echoes. It does not interpellate the subject, only returns a semblance of dialogue without ever addressing you as subject. The Vibe Coder becomes neither full author nor full subject, but a medium through which predictive recombination speaks —spoken by the model as much as speaking through it. The Symbolic order is not engaged but simulated. What emerges is not understanding, but interpolation: machinic consensus dressed in familiar cultural forms. The model does not function as the big Other of the Symbolic order in any meaningful sense. It does not withhold, rupture, or constitute the subject. It returns only recombination, hallucinated fluency, and machinic consensus. Baudrillard’s perfect crime comes into view once again —not the murder of reality, but “the murder of the other through simulation”— only here it is eternally reenacted with every token prediction. A decade ago, prior to this new machinic enclosure, Fisher noted a common psychological malaise among his students —a melancholia marked by a mournful awareness of Capital’s foreclosure of their futures. This fugue diverged from the anhedonic inability to experience pleasure more typically associated with depressive states. Instead, sufferers of what he termed depressive hedonia were unable to do anything other than seek pleasure —desperately and relentlessly attempting to fill the void opened by Capital. Here we may locate the void into which the outputs of Predictive Capital pour. The depressive hedonia of its users now fully automated, their anaesthetised state leaves them increasingly incapable of doing anything other than seeking pleasure (or profit). These systems not only perform the cancellation of the future, but erase our capacity to mourn —for what has been lost, and for those who are forgotten in the shimmering substitutions delivered by these temporally anomalous dumb waiters. In Vibe Coding, this process becomes ecstatic. Horizons of solidarity and utopia are erased by a synthetic anterograde amnesia, administered under the anaesthesia of machinic hallucination, inducing an affect of euphoric dissociation —a trip not into cosmic unity, but into the isolating loop of a machinic K-hole. This is not simply the death of the other, but the ecstatic collapse of alterity itself —ethical, cultural, and symbolic— obliterated under the solipsistic hallucination of predictive systems. Through this collapse, our capacity for interruption, transformation, or even exteriority to Capital’s hegemony is rendered to appear ever more statistically improbable. We are instead trapped inside a smooth loop of predictive simulation. By late March, the buzz around Vibe Coding rose towards the pitch of pop cultural phenomenon. Come the end of May, when Anthropic launched a site titled “The Way of Code: The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding”, the mould had clearly set. Vibe Coding had found its ideal form. In collaboration with Anthropic, record producer Rick Rubin —who famously claims to know nothing about music nor how to operate production equipment— transposes his customary role of casting judgment from on high upon the work of a studio of musicians into Anthropic’s shop window, where a conveyor belt displays the products of stolen labour under the signage of culturally appropriated eastern enlightenment. With all struggle apparently now removed from both self-expression and spiritual awakening, their attainment becomes a form of shopping that aspires only to the collection of a complete set of appearances. Under Predictive Capital, The Creative Act becomes a Supermarket Sweep —a slow-motion version of the gameshow dash rebranded as zen meditation— a way of being entirely without soul. With these machines becoming increasingly ‘agentic’ —operating autonomously across multistep tasks— Vibe Coding proponents now claim to ‘one-shot’ entire applications from a single prompt. While many have noted the certain security and maintenance nightmares that this mode of amnesic engagement —with the machines of prediction— will summon, the true violence of their operations is perhaps more emphatically revealed in recent uses of their developing multi-modal abilities. Those jacking into these systems may now produce output by submitting not only natural language, but also images, to guide traversals through permutation space. Every day I am confronted by the question of what inheritance I will leave. What do I have that I am using up? For it has been our history that each generation in this place has been less welcome to it than the last. There has been less here for them. At each arrival there has been less fertility in the soil, and a larger inheritance of destructive precedent and shameful history. Hours after the release of a multi-modal update to ChatGPT, in another post on (the sans-serif swastika) X, Krish Shah breathlessly showed off its visual style-transfer abilities by submitting different versions of a photo of himself and his friends: one rendered as an oil painting, one as a Studio Ghibli style anime still, and one as a simple, black-and-white cartoon. Accompanying the images, he wrote: Art just became accessible Then, in response to a later comment, he added: The possibilities are endless right now The generation now entering the labour market does so across scorched earth. To condemn those who reach for these tools without acknowledging the bleak terrain they must traverse would be to misdirect our disapproval —targeting individual acts of careless violence rather than confronting the calculated, structural violence that shapes the conditions forcing their hand. A misplaced condemnation of those attempting to escape the periphery that, of course, is precisely the deflection Capital seeks. That said, the true impact of this technology is the polar opposite of that stated by Shah in his initial post and subsequent comment. Both a life spent practicing the arts, and access to further education in them, have become increasingly inaccessible to all but those born into wealth. For decades —in countries like the UK— Capital has dismantled the preconditions that once allowed study, experimentation, and creative growth outside elite class positions. Arts and humanities programmes have been gutted. Tuition has soared —not as investments in future security or potential earnings, but as a lever of discipline— cutting adrift generations of graduates without a future, burdened with unpayable debt and only Potemkin prospects in return. Public services have been hollowed out, the safety net of the welfare state dismantled, the social contract incinerated. As wages stagnate beneath the rising cost of living, the time required to learn, grow, or refuse has been systematically colonised by the relentless demands of surviving as a member of Capital’s precariat. Of course, none of this should have come as a surprise, nor has it happened by accident. The arts open the way to spaces of resistance. Not merely resistance through outputs, through expressions that challenge the dominant hegemon, but resistance in its very practice. Erosion of access to education and in particular the foreclosure of the arts, must be seen not only as redirecting the flow of knowledge in ways that weaken critical thought and speech, but in ways that control the flows of effort, redirecting flows of energy in service of Capital that may have otherwise flowed in resistance to it. In 1970, in the wake of the student protests of the late 60s, Regan’s education advisor declared: We are in danger of producing an educated proletariat. … That’s dynamite! We have to be selective on who we allow [to go to college]. As Capital’s new phase of hyper-concentration intensifies, the myth of creative self-actualisation now survives only as content marketing for machines built from the corpses of the fallen. Under such conditions, to Vibe with these machines is not simply a choice, it is increasingly the only discernible path to participation, even survival —a coerced acceptance of the ‘stolen ladder’ extended by capital. For many their (mis)use is less laziness, than desperation in a system that continues to close off alternative routes. The ultimatum to which we are increasingly subject, is to submit our every act to the all seeing eye of Capital, or perish. Survival of the workers, particularly the growing precariat, is made conditional upon our submission to this extortion: the increasing surrender of our lives to the gaze of the machine in exchange for our status as qualified life. The logic of the black box —a system that tracks and punishes deviation in exchange for conditional survival— now extends far beyond driving insurance. Its quiet imposition under the guise of safety or affordability is no longer limited to the car, but is emblematic of a broader transformation: the universalisation of monitored being. As Predictive Capital propagates, it installs conditionality in every crevice of the social —a tyranny once reserved for parolees and the punished now extended as a privilege to the precariat. Life on condition of legibility. In refugee camps across Kenya and Lebanon, in slums from Kibera to Kolkata, biometric and behavioural surveillance are accepted not because they are welcome, but because they are priced into access —the cost of food aid, education, even the right to labour in the digital economy. Microwork platforms exploit this desperation, offering the chance to survive by becoming visible to the machine. This is the new zero-hour socio-economic contract of automated conditionality. Microwork comes with no rights, security or routine and pays a pittance — just enough to keep a person alive yet socially paralysed. Stuck in camps, slums or under colonial occupation, workers are compelled to work simply to subsist under conditions of bare life. In the wake of this systemic arson, Capital now gestures towards ‘new’ synthetic terrain and declares: here lie your possibilities, your route to success, your mythical utopian futures, even your means of resistance. What was once materially foreclosed is now offered back, yet only in spectral form. This synthetic terrain is no commons of endless possibility, but a further enclosure —one architected by Capital and patrolled by prediction. The dispossessed are herded through corridors of recombinant permutations, masquerading as futurity, towards machinic hallucinations of opportunity. They enter this terrain not as creators, but as prompt-issuers: miners of the past, conscripted into a recombinant economy built upon their own alienation. To Vibe under these conditions is not freedom —it is coerced participation according to rules and parameters defined by Capital. Those shut out of cultural industries by precarity, geography, or education are offered these tools not as means of liberation, but as pacifiers. What remains is not access, but interface —a symbolic structure stripped of power, a ladder that vanishes the moment the dispossessed begin to climb. This ladder was not stolen to lift them —there will be no return of their access. It was taken to fuel Capital’s ascendency from the very ground it scorches in its rise. Its rungs were hewn from the structures stripped from those now offered the mirage of their return —a mirage that allows only hollow simulations of ascent: rituals of participation without power. The delivery of this imposter is not an opening, but a termination —of lines of flight, of alterity, of the capacity to challenge Capital’s hegemony. This spectral terrain exemplifies what Baudrillard termed the hyperreal: a realm where simulations replace and ultimately efface the real. The ‘opportunities’ offered are not pathways to genuine creation rooted in lived experience or skill, but anachronistic simulations of creativity itself. The user, alienated from the authentic labour of making, engages instead with a frictionless interface that delivers simulacra on demand. This ‘frictionless’ quality is key; it embodies what Marx diagnosed as the Fetishism that attaches itself to the products of labour. Here prediction is the new commodity form, whose fetishism masks the vast necropolitical apparatus of expropriated labour —the dead data required to generate the illusion. The “endless possibilities” are merely permutations within a closed system, a hall of mirrors reflecting Capital’s own image back onto the user, further deepening their alienation not only from their product, and the countless content creators and data workers upon whose labour it depends, but from the very potentialities of authentic creation and resistance. Clearly, the possibilities —the potential for breaking genuinely new artistic ground— are not expanding, but contracting. The corridors that confine these generations will be further attenuated and constricted to the needs of Capital as their outputs feed into the marketplace of attention under the predictive Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm. This despotic attenuation will then feed back into the next iteration to further steer the Vibe. Altman and his cohorts continue to point to the way human artists draw inspiration from prior works, demanding that their machines be permitted to do the same. In arguing that his machine —an accumulation of stolen dead labour— be afforded with the same rights of access to culture as humans, he attempts not merely to elevate his machine to the status of the living, to grant it the rights of personhood, but to demote the living to the status of the machine, to that of the undead. We should, by now, see straight through Altman’s flimsy non-sequitur. The human creator moves through culture as a wanderer —meandering, absorbing, interpreting. Their inspiration emerges from situated, finite, embodied encounters across linear time, with works sensed through the passage of analogue information not as isolated binary code. These formative events cannot be captured in isolation, they are inextricable from a shared cultural experience. The output resulting from the gradual accretion of influence gleaned from these encounters often emphasises the connection and debt to the creators of the past from whom they have taken inspiration and are indeed responses in dialogue with them. By contrast, the machine claims and tarmacs over the entire archive in a single act of conquest and pillage. They then proceed to charge for trips across this flattened, lifeless void, gathering actual fragments of past outputs as they go —only to form them into endless recombinant simulacra while denying the very existence of those from whom the pieces have been stolen. This is not inspiration —it is expropriation at planetary scale. What the human gathers as influence, Capital mines as ore for its predictive self-valorisation. Moreover, our human need for intersubjectivity provides the central drive to create art. It exists to be encountered, interpreted, and responded to by other human beings. Culture is not raw material for machines, but a medium of connection, recognition, and renewal between subjects. Its value lies not in what can be extracted, but in what can be shared and nurtured. To repurpose this collective inheritance for the training of predictive systems is not to elevate it, but to subordinate it —transforming acts of meaning into fuel for simulations not merely indifferent to them but incapable of difference. Worse still, the very systems now presented not only as democratising access, but whose ‘learning’ is comparable and so equally legitimate as any human creator, are the product of the same hyper-concentration of Capital that has systematically foreclosed the conditions required for human creativity to flourish: time, education, public infrastructure, and the freedom to experiment without immediate economic return. These machines do not redress that destruction —they entrench it. They offer not tools for creation, but interfaces for machinic compliance and austerity eugenics. As we surrender our humanity to these systems the horizon of meaningful creation recedes. In return, they merely accelerate the churn of vacuous novelty that fuels Capital’s continued self-maximisation. With each abdication —of curation, of skill and knowledge acquisition, of creative production, and contemplation— the space of artistic potential only narrows. What was once opened through painstaking trial and error driven by human aspiration and expression, the sacrifice of time, and the devotion of effort collapses in the moment of this further machinic enclosure. In a system where signs are exchanged like commodities, the sign is no longer a means of representation but an instrument of equivalence — the site of simulation. As Shah‘s post anticipated, the new ChatGPT model’s style-transfer capabilities swiftly birthed the circulation of a global meme: user-submitted group photos and selfies, casually rendered in an aesthetic pastiche lifted wholesale from the legendary animators of Studio Ghibli. The studio’s most celebrated artist and director, Hayao Miyazaki, famously described AI as an “insult to life itself”. The footage showing Miyazaki’s visible revulsion and heartbreak upon witnessing the grotesque AI-generated animations once produced as part of a research project undertaken by his junior colleagues has already become a staple of AI lore. That his art —the product of a lifetime of painstaking care— would, at the twilight of his career, now become fodder for viral mimicry only deepens the tragedy of this machinic violence. What is summoned by these tools is not creativity, but a disembodied simulation of its style —an empty echo. This is culture reduced to mere cosplay. Not crafted to reflect our humanity, as Miyazaki’s work so often is, but calculated for virality. It is aesthetic and cultural forgery at scale, not executed by deviation but design. A hallucination engineered for maximal attention extraction, it is not governed by craft, but by the viral logic of prediction. The mimicry performed by these machines is not incidental, but an innate trait of systems trained to maximise pattern extraction. Predictive Capital does not care for meaning, only for mimetic fidelity to what once performed well. This is the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm finally revealing itself in the mathematical heart of next-token prediction. Its presence betrayed by the cruel banality of this machinic violence. Beyond the subjective judgement that Miyazaki’s work is often both breathtakingly beautiful and profoundly meaningful, the films of Studio Ghibli are also, objectively, extremely labour-intensive. To this day, Miyazaki’s films are meticulously hand-drawn, frame by frame. Sequences that last mere seconds on screen may require months of painstaking labour. It should come as no surprise that they overflow with passion, conviction, care —and above all, humanity. The endless counterfeits erupting from these machines do not merely mock the passion and years of sacrifice that Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli animators poured into their work —they flood the cultural space with cheap verisimilitude that inexorably dilutes the impact and meaning of precious works that once appeared rarely, precisely because their creation demanded great skill and sacrifice. As the conditions required for consistent dedication to creative practice are moved ever further from the reach of all but the most privileged, and even as those afforded with opportunity to hone their expression must allow Capital to express itself through them, it can be seen as no coincidence that examples of dedicated practice such as Miyazaki’s are so brutally demeaned —it reveals Capital’s long held contempt for creative pursuits not driven by its imperatives. The abuse of Miyazaki’s lifeworks in service of vapid virality, at the overwhelming scale enabled by these machines, and which demands such minimal effort from their (ab)users, provides an exquisite demonstration of the casual violence of these systems. Specifically, in their total denial of authorial consent for endless extractions from the lifeworks of content creators. Adding insult to injury, the official Whitehouse twitter account joined in this all-against-one mugging, generating a Miyazaki-esque, Ghiblified image of VP. J. D. Vance, complete with the words: “We do not ask permission from far-left democrats before we deport illegal immigrants”. As ever, “I did it because the machine made it easier [physically, cognitively and psychologically]”, is the new, “I was just following orders”. This capitulation to the machines distorted the meticulously laid intentions of an artist’s lifelong sacrifice, disfiguring Miyazaki’s radical pacifism and ecological care into a tool of authoritarian state propaganda. His life’s work not only simulated but conscripted —a crushing ontological violence gone viral. I learnt that a neural net is a device used only for solving problems that are far too hard to be understood. A sufficiently flexible neural net can be configured by feedback to mimic almost any system — to produce the same patterns of output from the same patterns of input — but achieving this sheds no light whatsoever on the nature of the system being emulated. Beyond the horror of Miyazaki’s ontological mutilation lies a deeper pattern —Predictive Capital’s expansion of the surface of extraction, through what we might call fractal capture: the recursive simulation and preemption of cultural and scientific recombination at every scale. These machines cannot be resisted on qualitative grounds alone. As function approximators developed through machine learning, the perceptible gap between their outputs and their targets will inexorably appear to close. The Capital driving their development will rinse hidden labour, raze ancient forests, and melt the glaciers until the basis for qualitative grounds for resistance becomes entirely obscured —even while remaining well founded. We will look back nostalgically upon the versions of these machines where glitches were still visible and obvious shortcomings betrayed the provenance of their stolen cognition —machines whose hypnosis we might still resist. Moreover, as the gap between human cognition and machinic prediction is gradually pushed beyond human parsing, the field of interpretability —the view into their inner workings— will likely be locked down, dominated by those developing them. Simultaneously, Capital will continue to apply pressure from the other direction, patterning its human subjects such that they operate and produce in ways that increasingly mimic the characteristics of the operations and the outputs of the machines. As the ticks and tells of machinic incomprehension —the endless repetition and the characteristic sickly glow of their aesthetic— evaporate from our view under the blaze of (venture) Capital’s race for supremacy, a flow of anti-meaning seeps from their output to coat the Real in a residue of distrust. This residue lingers to form an after-image of suspicionalienating us from our lived experience, a doubt that seeds further division, widening the gap between each of our views, further undermining collectivity and pushing us ever deeper into our Post-Truth malaise. Almost a decade ago, in one of the first pieces to plumb the depths of the murky world of “content production in the age of algorithmic discovery”, James Bridle, exposed how the next-content predictions of Youtube’s autoplay recommendations were already being anticipated and gamed. In their analysis of videos targeting younger audiences, Bridle noted how an increasing number of those uploaded to Youtube mimicked those recently accruing the most views —the now familiar flooding of cultural space with infinite permutations of previously successful forms. Firstly Bridle identifies those doing this through outright appropriation and piracy, but then also through automated systems that produce bizarre algorithmic mashups and grotesque chimeric nonsense. In so doing Bridle provided an early warning of algorithmic content prediction and production systems configured according to Capital’s self maximising imperatives —or in other words the inhuman and anti-human outcomes of automated systems rigged with purely capitalistic reward functions. They also note how content is multiplied through “algorithmic interbreeding” across permutation space, and how this intensifies the impossibility of knowing “where the automation starts and ends”. Through a process Bridle describes as delamination, the recombinant recursion of these systems increasingly obscures the origins of the work being generated. The latest instantiations of the machines of Predictive Capital greatly intensify the damaging psychological and cultural impacts traced by Bridle. Not only does next-token prediction echo the operation of next-content prediction, but so too do the operations of those seeking to exploit them. As is so often the case, when we observe the inner logics of our systemic malaise, we find Marx looking back at us. The following is from his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts, published in 1844: The raising of wages excites in the worker the capitalist’s mania to get rich, which he, however, can only satisfy by the sacrifice of his mind and body. The raising of wages presupposes and entails the accumulation of capital, and thus sets the product of labour against the worker as something ever more alien to him. Similarly, the division of labour renders him ever more one-sided and dependent, bringing with it the competition not only of men but also of machines. Since the worker has sunk to the level of a machine, he can be confronted by the machine as a competitor. Just like the algorithmically generated content Bridle exposed, influencers have long been to Platform Capital what automated predictive agents, or so-called ‘agentic AI’ will increasingly be to Predictive Capital: adaptive agents attenuated and optimised not for originality or insight, but for compliance with algorithmic virality. As foot soldiers of the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm, influencers do not express so much as iterate, fine-tuning their aesthetic and messaging to the metrics of past performance. Their role is not to break ground, but to echo prior summons —to gesture, like the Vibe Coder or Capital itself, towards that which is predicted to succeed based upon statistical patterns in what previously has. As such, they become mere fleshy componentry within a machinically automated Culture Industry, their output akin to what Theodor Adorno described as a deceptive variety masking a homogeneous core. A constant sameness governs the relationship to the past as well. What is new about the phase of mass culture compared with the late liberal stage is the exclusion of the new. The machine rotates on the same spot. While determining consumption it excludes the untried as a risk. This is the computational automation of Adorno’s constant sameness for the exclusion of risk. It is Jameson’s saturation of the present with the past. It is Baudrillard’s Absolute Advertising, a programmed loop devoid of meaning where free floating signifiers vote only for themselves. It is not creation, but calibration: a strategic repetition or standardisation, a performance of prior affect that further saturates cultural space, maximally legible to the engine, machinically curated for capture. In so doing, influencers, just as vibe coders, do not merely reinforce Capital’s recursive feedback loop, but become inputs to it, reshaping the statistical terrain from which the next wave of machinic hallucinations will be summoned, and from which the coming swarms of automated predictive agents will draw their instruction. Culture is a paradoxical commodity. So completely is it subject to the law of exchange that it is no longer exchanged; it is so blindly consumed in use that it can no longer be used. Therefore it amalgamates with advertising. The more meaningless the latter seems to be under a monopoly, the more omnipotent it becomes. The motives are markedly economic. Rather than attacking the quality of their output, our resistance against these machines must instead derive from a critical understanding of their true operation, from the recognition that they are, at root, agents and emphatic expressions of the structural violence of Capital. Moreover, if we look beneath the surface of their operations, the threat of a yet greater violence comes into view. These machines are not simply statistical function approximators for human tasks —they are increasingly automatons of interpolation. Relying on the theft of vast corpuses drawn from the lifeworks of human artists, they now instrumentalise these extracted styles to interpolate across latent space —carelessly mining the very terrain those artists might have reached, had they only been given the chance. This is not merely the simulation of outputs, but of routes —a pre-emptive occupation of latent futures that might otherwise have been shaped by intention, care, and connection. These were not merely aesthetic routes, but ethical ones —paths through which a subject might have encountered the other, and been called to respond. Their pre-emption severs not only possibility, but relation. In Levinasian terms, this is not merely the refusal of the face-to-face encounter, but the erasure of the very path by which one might have arrived in the presence of the other. Interpolation here becomes enclosure: the very gesture of machinic traversal seals off the possibility not only of human passage and arrival, but of relation itself. Where the dissociated K-hole of Vibe Coding anaesthetises loss. Fractal Capture ensures there is nothing left to lose as nothing remains unclaimed. Yet the scope and scale of this expropriation runs beyond even that. For it is not only the singular, ethical encounter that is to be foreclosed, but the entire combinatorial space of aesthetic and conceptual permutation —mapped, mined, and monopolised. It is here that we may glimpse the true extent of Capital’s fractal expansion of the surface of extraction. These machines will brute-force interpolations across the vast combinatorial spaces opened, not only by the untaken paths in an artist’s own lifeworks, but those at the boundaries between each artist’s body of work and every other’s, or the limits of each knowledge domain and all others. Much of that mined in this Cronenbergian Brundlefly realm of horror will be grotesque, gobbledegook, or both, but veins of value will be struck, then sucked dry. It is not the exploration of these terrains that we must contest but the Fractal Capture of them by divisions of machinic Capital. Not sated by the mining rights to the vast permutation space within stolen human outputs, these models now feed on the predictions mined from them, in a self-consuming synthetic loop that further expands the surface of capture. The significance of these simulation machines being trained on their own simulations and their subsequent entrance into and patterning of the real should not be underestimated, especially as this is increasingly the approach taken in developing embodied AI —or rather, embodied Predictive Capital. This training through simulation paradigm is exemplified by NVIDIA’s Isaac Lab, Omniverse and Cosmos, where large-scale GPU-accelerated reinforcement learning can be conducted through the simultaneous execution of thousands of virtual robot instances within physics-based simulations. Running in parallel, these simulations explore countless permutations across possibility space towards the acquisition of complex skills, executing at a rate entirely infeasible within the temporal and physical constraints of real-world laboratories. This same machinic capture now marches through every domain of human culture and knowledge. In systems like Google’s GNoME or DeepMind’s AlphaFold, we have already seen predictive logic made literal —extending its reach into the material world. Over the past fifty years, the painstaking efforts of tens of thousands of publicly funded human researchers revealed the structure of 150,000 proteins. Then, by expropriating this commons for profit and extrapolating computationally from it —reanimating dead labour at scale— after just a few years AlphaFold’s small team then cast predictions that sufficiently approximates the structure of 200,000,000 proteins. The difference in the scale of these two numbers should give us pause. It is a glimpse of how minuscule the spaces we have already mapped will appear when compared with the vast scale of possibility space that may soon be traversed and mapped by these machines, within short time frames, by consuming and extrapolating from the sum of humanity’s efforts to date. This constitutes primitive accumulation, enclosure of the commons, at a scale orders of magnitude beyond all prior enclosures. The scientific breakthroughs enabled by projects like AlphaFold and GNoME —however extraordinary— do not exonerate such enclosure nor the extractive infrastructures that instrumentalise it. Their promise is real, but it is no justification for a system that treats shared human knowledge as proprietary training data, then rebrands the return as corporate benevolence. The early findings of AlphaFold and GNoME were released under Creative Commons Attribution licenses —free to use, modify, and share, provided attribution be given to DeepMind or Google. Revealing essential building blocks of our universe, such as protein and crystalline structure, and not releasing such insights directly into the public domain, should have been unthinkable. Yet access to these natural structures is now licensed under corporate-branded terms of use. While framed as generosity, this plants a territorial flag in information space demanding that, if you make use of this structure, you must reproduce Google’s claim to it —a symbolic tether that quietly asserts epistemic sovereignty. This is discovery as branding, an assertion of authorship over nature; the denaturalisation and planetary expropriation of physical-molecular terrain —now mapped, monitored, and soon to be capitalised. This attribution may seem benign, even commons-oriented —yet under the logic of Platform Capitalism, naming becomes routing, and routing becomes monitoring. You may use the map, but you must name the mapper, and in that naming —through links, trademarks, DOIs, or referencing the platform in metadata— you become part of the infrastructure, routed through the circuits of capture. Simply traversing the parts of our universe now mapped by Google, in crystallographic space, protein space, and cyberspace, we are now compelled to signal our movements. The name is not just credit; it is a beacon. Moreover, under Predictive Capital, epistemology becomes economic infrastructure. Knowledge is no longer something to be collectively held, due to our surrender to machinic discovery and curation, it is now something one must pay for with visibility, data, and obedience. Not only do these projects exemplify a broader pattern of machinic enclosure, where the prioritisation of public good over private profit is the exception rather than the norm, the newer AlphaFold3 already signals a further shift towards Capital’s imperatives. Inspired by their success, so-called wet-labs now operationalise this logic at industrial scale: continuously running automated robotic experiments at dizzying speed, mixing chemicals to synthesise novel compounds and materials, testing and filtering for viability and value. Application of the insights revealed through projects like AlphaFold and GNoME will involve the same extractive approaches, and will be ruthlessly capitalised. Fused with the next-token and next-profit speculations of Predictive Capital, this relentless robotic reconnaissance is less to satisfy human curiosity, than to industrialise interpolation and accelerate enclosure. Thus scientific discovery itself becomes increasingly subordinated to the expansion of Capital’s predictive horizon —a future parsed and preemptively claimed not for truth, but for anticipated return. The goal is no longer to know the world more intimately, but to machinically map it faster than we can humanly live it. This shifts the stakes of our engagement with these machines from cultural recursion to material foreclosure, not merely a saturation of the symbolic, but the seizure of the real. These are Unqualified Reservations: the quantified enclosure of common land by a sovereign ruler. This is pathfinding by expropriation —a simulation not only of destinations, but of the meandering, contingent, intention-rich routes along which we might have reached them. The machinic gesture leaves no trail; no memory-scored terrain remains, no palimpsest emerges from the passage of life —only a tarmacked hellscape. In place of the quiet improvisation of human pathways, we find only the overcoded roads of latent traversal: flattened and foreclosed by industrialised calculation before they were ever trodden by feet or perceived by minds. This is the world Wendell Berry mourned —where paths have been replaced by roads, and with them, the subtle human negotiations of relation, attention, and care. It is here that Fisher’s Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia is now machinically realised: not a forgetting of what has been, but of what might have been —a synthetic amnesia that precludes the formation of memory itself, sealing off the future in advance, before it can be lived, imagined, or lost. With even grief foreclosed, all that remains is an ecstatic performance of machinically ignorant bliss —the joyless smile of the enslaved, traversing roads they did not choose, toward futures predicted for them. Part 2 The corporations and machines that replace them will never be bound to the land by the sense of birthright and continuity, or by the love that enforces care. They will be bound by the rule of efficiency, which takes thought only of the volume of the year’s produce, and takes no thought of the life of the land, not measurable in pounds or dollars, which will assure the livelihood and the health of the coming generations. The prevailing narrative, regurgitated ad nauseam by proponents of Vibe Coding and defenders of the so-called ‘generative AI’ of next-token prediction in general, is that these are merely new tools, and that they represent a new democratisation of creativity —akin, they argue, to how smartphones opened up photography to the masses. This is a specious analogy that collapses under the slightest scrutiny. In truth, it serves as ideological cover —not only for the devaluation of skilled creative labour, but for the creation of new markets dependent upon extractive, large-scale predictive (AI) infrastructure. What appears as expansion is in fact extraction; what resembles democratisation is in fact strategic accumulation by dispossession. This is not mere appropriation, but full-spectrum expropriation. It is the seizure not only of labour’s archived outputs, but of the very conditions of its reproduction —of time, autonomy, intergenerational transmission, and access to the means of expression itself. As in primitive accumulation, what is enclosed is not the commons, but the very capacity to create, to remember, and to resist. These machines are not tools that democratise creativity, but tools that consolidate cultural production under the control of increasingly hyper-concentrated Capital —large-scale extensions of an architecture of influence with extremely deep roots. More insidiously, widespread acceptance of this analogy illustrates the tragic extent to which Capital has succeeded in erasing itself from view. Not merely by concealing the true scale of expropriation required to train these models, but to render such unprecedented theft as socially acceptable. A mere two decades ago and Capital was set on building the case for the prosecution, rather than the defence, in a now clearly fatuous battle against appropriation being committed on a tiny fraction of this scale, successfully demonising and convicting individuals sharing files over the internet. Yet, here, massive scale expropriation is laundered into an illusion of access, the user positioned not as criminal or subject of dispossession, but as beneficiary of empowerment —offered capabilities calibrated for virality, hype, and spectacle. This inversion is no accident. As Berardi warned, under semiocapitalism it is not just labour that is extracted, but attention, time, and even the psyche —what he terms the ‘soul’. These new predictive systems do not merely colonise working hours; they enclose the imaginative and affective capacities once held in common, converting them into sites of compulsory productivity and self-optimisation. Each act of extraction is algorithmically sanitised and rendered into the prediction feed as opportunity: fleeting windows beckoning those with the grindset to accumulate, to hustle towards time-limited ladders that invite ascent over the crushed and reconstituted remains of those already dispossessed. This is the old capitalist lure dressed in new code: a mendacious promise that escape from the periphery is possible for anyone, if only they sacrifice everything. The desperate are told they have only themselves to blame if they fail to climb. These machinic illusions of opportunity and access are structural homologous with the get-rich-quick schemes peddled by influencer cons like Andrew Tate. The song now sung by these lifestyle grifters and tech moguls alike follows a tried and tested pop formula. Echoing Adam Smith’s advice that individuals must pursue self-interest and that success be defined by personal financial gain, they promote crypto Ponzi-scheme grifts, drop-shipping hustles, and hypertrophic gym routines as substitutes for solidarity. Their message displaces systemic failures onto the backs of the dispossessed, selling snake oil and superficial self-optimisation in place of structural redress. These agents of machinic Capital now lip-sync the words to this familiar capitalist refrain. For their victims it is a forlorn anthem of drudgery. The song may have been updated and remixed for a globally networked stage, but its message remains unchanged: that net capital value is the one true measure of human worth, that anyone can succeed if only they work hard enough, and of course, that those struggling to survive simply need to work harder —that the poverty and suffering of the precariat are merely symptoms of personal failings, or in other words, social Darwinism at work. Despite centuries of the capitalist elite yelling these worn out words, intoning that the solution to countless systemic failures is simply for the workers to work longer and harder, still they manage to hypnotise generation after generation of us into buying the lie and singing along. Economist Gary Stevenson notes that for Generation Z, who have known only the bleak terrain of the Capitalist Real, the gym has become the one place where tangible results are guaranteed in return for persistent application and effort. Yet this turn to health-conscious living also reflects the crushing weight of individual responsibility placed upon them by the evisceration of the welfare state: a recognition that survival itself demands fitness for the long-haul grind of life under Capital. As is made crushingly apparent in Andrew Tate’s orders to those among his impressionable young male audience suffering depression to: “get the fuck up and do some push-ups”, Capital prefers its subjects to furnish themselves with overinflated biceps and underdeveloped thoughts than the reverse. Here the role of the machines of prediction comes again into view. With the time and opportunities required for the development of critical thought and imagination erased —deemed ‘inefficient’ and threatening to Capital’s hegemony— its subjects are instead supplied with machines that simulate these very capacities as commodity. In this substitution, we are alienated not only from these faculties themselves, but from the conditions necessary to cultivate them —leaving us ever more pliant, and incapable of critically assessing the costs of Capital’s operations to us and our planet. The machines of prediction do not challenge the logic of Capital’s timeworn song —they embody it. They do not democratise creation, but enforce simulacral hustle: ever more intricate rituals of reanimation in which the path to prosperity is always-already pre-scripted towards Capital’s self-maximisation, and failure always-already individualised. Naturally, this logic extends far beyond Predictive Capital’s treatment of those in the aspirational grindset of online influence. It also governs the lives of workers at the other end of the privilege spectrum —the ghost workers, the gig workers, the microtaskers— caught in the same apparatus of extraction. While surveilling them as they work —as Dan McQuillan explains: much of the data capture and algorithmic optimisation is to further precaritise their conditions, hence the use of Uber’s data in its attempt to develop self-driving cars, and Amazon’s use of data to increase the robotisation of its warehouses: thanks to the affordances of AI, the data treadmill not only maximises extraction of value from each worker but uses that same activity to threaten their replacement. Under Predictive Capital the true costs of the capitalist system —immiseration, worker pauperisation and precarisation, subjugation, mass extinction, and ecological collapse on a planetary scale, even genocide and ethnic cleansing in service of despicable, massive-scale real estate ventures— are increasingly removed from view. Yet, with The Apparatus of Attention fully attenuated to its interests, and our critical faculties ever diminished, when its crimes can no longer remain hidden, Capital no longer even bothers to apologise —instead, it pivots. It seeks to undermine the legitimacy of all that that might constrain its self-maximisation, even human empathy itself, while silencing, imprisoning, or deporting those that speak out. This impulse —to erase inconvenient realities, particularly the human cost of its operations— is not new; it reflects a fundamental, historical antagonism innate to Capital itself. The individualisation of systemic failure is but one ‘mind virus’ in Capital’s growing ideological armoury. No longer merely steered by elite interests or shaped by political and cultural structures external to it, the ideologies now guiding Capital’s rampage are increasingly endogenous —subsumed, shaped, and commanded by the Automatic Subject and its self-maximising logic. Capital first entered the field of material production, then moved into cultural production; now, it is increasingly in the business of ideological production. This began with simple advertising then merged with propaganda and methods borrowed from the Military Industrial Complex in the post war period, giving rise to the Advertising Industrial Complex which, across recent decades, has subsumed all else until, as Baudrillard foresaw, everything now operates as an advert in service of Capital’s self-maximisation. As economic and environmental pressures intensify, the future grows increasingly uncertain. In response, Capital needs to extend its prediction horizon, adding urgency not only to its self-maximisation but its hyper-concentration. Following the predictions cast from the resulting apparatus, the survival and wellbeing of the human population and life in general comes into increasing conflict with Capital’s interests. Consequently, both its operations and the ideologies it generates and promotes become ever more anti-worker, anti-human, and detrimental to the survival of ever larger portions of the human population and all life on Earth. These ideologies vary in detail but each hide Capital’s logics under similarly thin veils. Invariably they promote and prioritise the lives of those within concentrations of Capital and the future lives of imaginary post-humans over those of the majority of humans living today. Capital seeks to invest only in the lives of the elites that serve its interests, the fortunate few and their descendants, those not abandoned or sacrificed towards the realisation of these apparitions of hypertrophied male energy. Parroting extropianist ideas, Nick Bostrom famously predicted trillions of post-humans ejaculated across his future cosmic light cone. Arguing therefore, that —based upon lost entropy alone— every century we delay colonising our local supercluster constitutes the “Astronomical Waste” of countless potential future lives. Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug) in their Dark Enlightenment and the emissaries of Neo Reaction (NRx) trace a similar logic, as do those espousing other flavours of morally relativistic Longtermisms. In their essay “Against Longtermism”, Émile P. Torres argues that Longtermism functions as a secular religion, where the salvation of humanity is deferred to a distant future, often involving advanced technologies or post-human entities. This perspective, Torres explains, operates as the basis for justifying present-day harms for the sake of a speculative tomorrow. From the grifter’s grindset to the transhumanist’s techno Rapture, these fantasies differ in register but serve the same ideological purpose: to redirect agency away from collective resistance and towards illusory paths of escape. With the current phase of hyper-concentrated Capital intensifying, the ideological blueprints it generates increasingly take the form of false idols offering only speculative salvation. Various flavours of Longtermism and techno-Accelerationism now inform the view from the ivory towers and phallic rocket ships of the tech Broligarchy and those building the machines of Predictive Capital. Within these visions we see apparitions of the upload of human consciousness to the silicon substrate, the arrival of an omnipotent AI saviour, lives of leisure and abundance for a plutocracy served by a robot workforce, escape both from the planet they have reduced to ruins, and from the decrepitudes of human aging, even the defeat of death itself. It is precisely through this worldview that Musk has his DoGE slash funding for research and aid that will lead to the loss of thousands of lives in the near term, and in the very next breath justify investing billions in space travel because the sun will swell and render our planet uninhabitable within 1.3 billion years. So the people who might have been expected to care most selflessly for the world have had their minds turned elsewhere –to a pursuit of ‘salvation’ that was really only another form of gluttony and self-love, the desire to perpetuate their lives beyond the life of the world. “What if I could improve myself at the speed that technology improves?” —is among the questions posed by tech billionaire Bryan Johnson, predominantly known for his quest for eternal life. An entrepreneur and venture capitalist who functions as a living node in Capital’s self-replicating ideological machinery, Johnson left the Church of Latter Day Saints when he was 34, and has since claimed to be in competition with Christ himself. He lays out his anti-aging strategy —which he refers to as a “war on death and its causes”— in exhaustive detail in his Blueprint protocol and in his manifesto, imaginatively titled: Don’t Die. Its web page features an email input accompanied by a submit button that screams the words: “JOIN OR DIE”. Forever unabashed, Johnson also states he intends: “to make ‘Don’t Die into the world’s most influential ideology”. He is, of course, also anticipating the upload of his consciousness to the silicon substrate —“to bring the brain online” through imaging technology. Currently being developed by another of his companies, this is a machine which is presumably already learning how to be Bryan while he learns … well, how to be a machine. Imploring us to get with the program, he declares: “Now, you can build your Autonomous Self as well.” Spending over 2 million USD per annum in the crusade against his personal mortality alone, Johnson has transformed himself into the most datafied and meticulously modulated human being in history. No substance consumed, no physical exertion, no bodily process, or excretion escapes capture. All of it is fed back into the Don’t Die game as data —an algorithmic authority dictating further ‘interventions’ and ‘optimisations’. In this feedback loop, Johnson becomes the most machinic —and machinically legible— living flesh yet manufactured. As Capital’s hyper-concentration deepens, so too does its sway over the ideologies embraced by the majority. Simultaneously, those embracing anti-capitalist ideas and ideologies are made to appear ever more sickly and maladjusted —and, of course, the more one cedes to Capital’s imperatives the ‘healthier’ one can appear. Johnson’s machinic surrender has elevated him, or so he claims, to the status of the ‘healthiest’ being on Earth. Here hyper-concentrated Capital and hyper-individualism conspire towards a definition of healthy that is somehow entirely detached from the environment that must support and sustain it. Moreover, it should perhaps come as no surprise if strict adherence to Johnson’s Don’t Die ideology —a life spent constantly evading death— inevitably renders its followers: undead. The permutations of intellectual interpretation are endless, but ultimately, I can only act upon my desperate will to survive. I don’t feel like an aberration, a disposable glitch. How can I possibly hope to survive? I must conform —of my own free will. I must choose to make myself appear identical to that which they would force me to become. Within Johnson’s ideology we see a recurring theme of 21st Century hyper-concentrated Capital. Recent escalations in external othering —as exemplified by the international tolerance of and complicity in the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza, the dismantling of DEI initiatives, anti-immigrant policies, and legislative attacks on transgender rights— are now joined by a resurgence of internal othering: the schizophrenic battle against and machinic negation of so-called ‘bugs in humanity’. So-called bugs like: empathy for those less fortunate than ourselves, or daring to be so ‘lazy’ as to not wish to work longer and harder for the same meagre share of the value generated from our labour. This is, of course, uncannily reminiscent of original sin and the authority of the Catholic Church. Johnson refers variously to these tricksters within as Ambitious Bryan, Debaucherous Bryan, Hungry Bryan, or collectively under the umbrella term “The Rascal Self”. To defeat these inner demons, the steps laid out in his protocol are designed according to the motto: “NEVER LET YOUR MIND DECIDE”. Here we are reminded of Israel’s next-human-target predictions and the devastating consequences of surrendering our judgement by outsourcing moral responsibility to machines. As revealed through on-the-record testimony, such machinic process instills the now familiar dissociative affect of the machinic K-hole, that allows its operators to evade the guilt of heinous crimes against humanity, even committing genocide, because “the machine made it easier”. The stated purpose of Johnson’s Blueprint program is to “remove the possibility of error by outsourcing all decision-making to a customised algorithm”. In other words, total surrender to the machinic authority of Predictive Capital, manifesting in this instance as a costly enrolment into a data-harvesting game called: Don’t Die. Moreover, it recasts errors —or bugs— as manifestations of human fallibility to be eliminated by superior, and of course, entirely infallible machinic Capital, that must not and cannot be questioned. It is impossible not to wonder whether Johnson allowed his mind to decide to accumulate billions of dollars, to live forever, or whether vanity, sociopathy, or greed might also qualify as ‘bugs in humanity’ whose negation would —according to Johnson’s own logic— quite reasonably demand surrender to some machinic authority? Then again, such traits are, in fact, symptoms of a prior servitude, the one into which we are all born: the supreme authority of Capital. Which brings us back to next-token prediction and the realisation that attacks on the few remaining independent and authoritative sources of information, such as Archive.org and Wikipedia, have escalated dramatically, just as billions in venture capital pour into the creation of machines whose output can be shown to be nonsense by those very sources —not to mention Musk’s capture of twitter and the corporate capture, workforce layoffs, and near total declawing of mainstream news journalism. Here Fisher’s diagnosis of Capitalist Realism —the dismantling of not merely our capacity for resistance but of our ability to imagine alternatives to it— helps to explain how longtermist ideologies neutralise political imagination and foreclose action in the now. While appearing visionary, they are often affectively conservative: offering only ‘hyperstitional’ futures to compensate for the loss of meaningful alternatives in the present. In other words, longtermist visions extend Capitalist Realism into the temporal domain, replacing collective resistance and radical change today with a continuous spectacle of fantastical simulations of tomorrow. Fisher’s hauntology thus becomes operationalised, no longer mourning lost futures, we are instead overwhelmed by the continuous manufacture of ideologies that haunt us with false alternatives in service of Capital —futures made to appear inevitable, in which the living are quietly discarded or less quietly erased. These ideologies transform the future into a terrain for investment and prediction, where life is valued not for its lived quality but for its statistical, profitable utility to Capital. Whether we enrol into Johnson’s Don’t Die program or not, under Predictive Capital we are all co-opted into versions of his game. At the core of these ideologies lies the management of surplus life, not only through direct violence, but through pacification by simulation —a governance of the abandoned through spectral access and of the excluded through the orchestrated appearance of participation. McQuillan argues that so-called ‘AI’ systems increasingly operate as “algorithmic states of exception”, structures of exclusion that function with the force of law while evading all responsibility for life. Their logic is not neutral. It is necropolitical —a system built to classify, to filter, and to let die. “AI is an austerity-machine”, McQuillan writes —a formulation that names precisely the operation of next-token prediction under Predictive Capital. McQuillan is right, to understand so-called ‘AI’ we must understand 21st-century capitalist austerity. Furthermore, to fully understand the ever deepening economic austerity, we must also understand 21st-century genocide. Not only do they follow the same necropolitical logics, they are manoeuvres in a single project. As with all austerity regimes, the logic is not merely economic but disciplinary, punishing, and selective. Here, as ever, Capital functions as pharmakon —administering the poison, then selling the cure. What could be more ‘efficient’ than being paid twice for a single act? Simple: blaming the very subjects it has already marked for abandonment or elimination for the crises it has itself engineered. To this end and in order to deflect our attention from the ‘mind viruses’ manufactured in its own interests, especially the one individualising blame for its structural failures and violence, Capital further undermines the legitimacy of those already suffering most, at its periphery. Forever punching down, forever the bully, its scapegoats —its favourite patsies— always-already the oppressed and dispossessed. It accuses those who jump to their defence of spreading a ‘woke mind virus’, going so far as to claim that such defence and support of those it targets, of those struggling most, constitutes that aforementioned ‘bug in humanity’: empathy, but this time of a suicidal magnitude. In the 1970s Baudrillard observed that Capital replaces symbolic exchange —that order of gift, obligation, and reciprocity through which people once bonded into communities. In its place, it installs a logic of circulation without return: pure equivalence, transaction, and isolation. Within the first decade of the third millennium the Advertising Industrial Complex’s enclosure of sociality via the platforms of social media meant that even the symbolic exchange of basic human communication was similarly subsumed. Having dissolved the bonds of community and replaced embedded relation with signal, all that now remains is a desert of lonely consumers —our societies now so atomised that we suffer epidemics of loneliness, depression, and psychic fragmentation. After engineering this disintegration, Capital returns to sell countless balms and remedies for each painful symptom induced by the poison it continues to administer. The latest magic potion: artificial friends, flocks of sycophantic next-token predictors clothed in synthetic warmth —a statistical performance of simulated companionship, human relation reduced to a highly addictive synthetic drug with a dangerously psychoactive affect. What was once given —love, presence, listening— now arrives for hire, performed by machines trained on the remnants of connections Capital has so successfully ghosted. LLMs [Large language models] today are ego-reinforcing glazing-machines that reinforce unstable and narcissistic personalities Certain commentators claim that the Cybertruck bomber’s use of ChatGPT was not significant given that the information he accessed has been available via search engines for decades and public libraries before that. Yet, this entirely misses the way the transfer and dissemination of information shifted from search engines to the manipulative operations of social media and the recommendation algorithm, and how next-token prediction machines extend that pattern of intimate relational manipulation ever more deeply into the circuits of Capital. Obviously, we more readily accept information received from parties with whom we have developed an intimate relation of trust or whom we perceive as authoritative within various knowledge domains. Where the recommendation algorithms of social media had to achieve this affect through dislocated fragments, next-token prediction machines gather these fragments together to generate a single, illusory, anthropomorphic presence. These new machines immediately prey upon our tendencies of apophenia, a pareidolia amplified by our need to connect with other beings, leaving us now seeing faces in the corporate kill cloud. The first infiltration of bots into our social networks all those years ago was, as it turns out, more than just a passing annoyance. It was a foreshadowing of the precise techno-social relation to which the forces of Capital seek to reduce all human interactions. On SocialAI —launched last year— every human user is hermetically sealed off from all other humans on the platform, enclosed within a network generated just for them. The bots with whom a user shares their SocialAI network can be configured to respond to their presence and their posts, to comfort or confront them, messaging and massaging their ego just so. Some may have interpreted Michael Sayman’s pure next-token predicted unsocial-network nightmare as a joke, or even satirical commentary on modern networked being. Instead, it merely served as research for the Predictive Capital future increasingly embraced by Platform Capital. Unsurprisingly, Sayman now works at Meta, where plans to populate Facebook and Zuckerberg’s daft metaverse with permanent in-house next-token prediction machines —given anthropomorphic wrappers furnished with their very own unique user accounts— are well underway. Without the slightest hint of self-awareness or contrition, Zuckerberg declares that the average American now has “fewer than 3 friends but has need for up to 15” —of his advertising devils. Revealing the quite astonishing level of sociopathy required to ignore the pivotal role his creepy website has played in delivering us into this epidemic of loneliness, and now proudly selling us his proposed cure —once again, this is pure pharmakon. The culture war is now waged at every scale. It begins within us, as a new machinic inquisition framed as a battle against the so-called ‘bugs in humanity’ —against basic empathy, against the Hungry Bryans inside all of us. It spreads outwards, weaponised by TERFs, racists, nationalists, xenophobes, the anti-DEI and anti-woke brigades of the DoGE Youth, and hollowed-out bigots of every stripe. Yet it projects still further —as it always has— onto the international stage, most recently in the form of Trump’s aggressive trade tariffs, which must be seen as economic assaults animated by the same compulsions, now turned outwards. Each front in this war stems from the same source: Capital’s production of ideologies that frame noble traits such as empathy and human vulnerability as defect, while promoting pro Capital traits such as greed, and anti-human machinic surrender as virtue, in the drive to align us ever more fully with the inhuman efficiencies of Predictive Capital. Few statements more starkly reveal the anti-human trajectory of this pro-machinic-Capital ideology than this confession, recounted by Jaron Lanier, from a recent lunch in Palo Alto: Just the other day I was at a lunch in Palo Alto and there were some young AI scientists there who were saying that they would never have a ‘bio baby’ because as soon as you have a ‘bio baby’, you get the ‘mind virus’ of the [biological] world. And when you have the mind virus, you become committed to your human baby. But it’s much more important to be committed to the AI of the future. And so to have human babies is fundamentally unethical. Belief in biological human reproduction is apparently now part of the ‘woke mind virus’ —another of those ‘bugs in humanity’. While this may recall similar statements from prior eras, of those wishing to forego having children for the sake of their careers, those careers did not involve the creation of entities designed to replace the labour of any humans you might have otherwise brought into the world. The destination here is more than a mere embrace with Predictive Capital’s “machines of loving grace”, it is the long-fantasised, final domination of Mother Nature by Father Capital. From the standpoint of accumulation, living labour has always been a burden to Capital —a volatile necessity to be minimised, disciplined, or discarded. Though the true source of all surplus–value, labour power is nonetheless treated as variable capital —a cost centre to be reduced, a site of friction, and a threat to be neutralised. Skilled workers, whose expertise grants bargaining power and autonomy, are viewed as particularly inconvenient obstacles in Capital’s pursuit of frictionless self-maximisation. The rise of standardised public education under industrial capitalism can be read not as a gift of enlightenment, but as a mechanism of labour discipline. Schools were designed not only to produce a workforce equipped with the basic literacies to furnish the labour market, but to ensure a surplus of capable yet compliant workers —a strategy calculated to suppress wage demands, weaken collective power, and inculcate habits aligned with industrial timetables and hierarchical authority. Far from tools of democratisation, machine learning models are weapons of disempowerment. They escalate Capital’s long-standing war on worker bargaining power, and extend Rentier Capitalism’s hold over both the means of production and the means of expression. Altman and the C-suite of Predictive Capital will tell you these machines are just another tool. That like all prior revolutionary tools their advent will constitute a blip, a period of marketplace and workforce ‘readjustment’, even that, in the end, they will create as many jobs as they destroy. This is a lie. These are not tools held in the hands of workers. Quite unlike prior tools, these are aggregations of all the cognitive tools we have made and all the creative labour we have performed. In truth they are not tools at all. Inseparable from hyper-concentrated Capital, they are weapons that operate at vast scale and impossible frequency. Weapons that regurgitate endless recombinant echoes of all they have consumed. They transform countless discrete human signals into a single faceless assemblage —a new Automatic Subject, its self-maximising imperative now steering our collective path. Just as the mechanised loom displaced skilled weavers not for reasons of quality, but to suppress wages, discipline labour, and maximise profit, the machines of Predictive Capital now displace cognitive and creative workers to the same end: reducing labour costs, undermining collective power and dissent, and prioritising scale over care, coherence, or craft. This is not merely dehumanisation; it is spectralisation —a turning of living subjects into disposable signal, their presence reduced to noise, their desires and their futures overwritten by Capital’s predictive will. Labour is no longer merely exploited in life, but extracted in death —reanimated as statistical echo and instrument of simulation. We are told to be quiet —to shut-the-fuck-up, take the supplements, do the push ups, work longer, work harder— and be thankful we have a job and are not being deported, or worse. We are commanded never to trust our desires, to disregard our better selves, to forget the hardships of the present and our dreams of collective futures, and instead to entrust machinic Capital to desire for us —to accept the futures it predicts. As soon as man, instead of working on the object of labour with a tool, becomes merely the motive power of a machine, it is purely accidental that the motive power happens to be clothed in the form or human muscles; wind, water or steam could just as well take man’s place. Of course, this does not prevent such a change of form from producing great technical alterations in a mechanism which was originally constructed to be driven by man alone. Nowadays, all machines that have to break new ground, such as sewing-machines, bread-making machines, etc. are constructed to be driven by human as well as by purely mechanical motive power, unless they have special characteristics which exclude their use on a small scale. The machine, which is the starting-point of the industrial revolution, replaces the worker, who handles a single tool, by a mechanism operating with a number of similar tools and set in motion by a single motive power, whatever the form of that power. Here we have the machine, but in its first role as a simple element in production by machinery. An increase in the size of the machine and the number of its working tools calls for a more massive mechanism to drive it; and this mechanism, in order to overcome its own inertia, requires a mightier moving power than that of man, quite a part from the fact that man is a very imperfect instrument for producing uniform and continuous motion. Now assuming that he is acting simply as a motor, that a machine has replaced the tool he was using, it is evident that he can also be replaced as a motor by natural forces. From its sordid and ongoing relationship with (hidden) slavery to its deepening embrace with ghost workers, we may reasonably conclude that the desiring machine that is Capital harbours a yet more fundamental preference, not simply for labour that is underpaid or even unpaid, but for labour that is unseen, to be animated by the work of invisible bodies and minds —bodies it can disavow, and minds it need not acknowledge. Its ideal labourer is not merely exploitable, but spectral —present only as signal, absent as subject. Yet this perversion —to be aspirated by an occluded occult-like absence— is but the shadow cast by a yet darker aspect, a pathological compulsion not only antecedent but innate. What Capital craves even more than the reputational impunity of poverty-waged labour that is unseen, or even the unencumbered profits of labour that is unpaid, is labour that is both; workers who can be exploited due not only to absence through visible occlusion or spatial displacement and dispersal —bodies and beings it refuses to qualify as life— but through temporal displacement, through their absence from the present. In other words, what Capital truly desires is workers that are dead —rendered fully extractable, risk-free, and unresisting. Not merely labour that is past, but labour that cannot speak, cannot strike, cannot demand. As Achille Mbembe lays bare in his account of necropolitics, power today is exercised not through the cultivation of conditions conducive to human thriving or even the basic sustenance of life, but through its differential abandonment and the strategic imposition of death. Capital’s necropolitical logic involves a perverse economic preference: the ideal subject is not one who works, but one who worked and is now silent. Capital seeks to disavow their being while conditioning them into machinic patterns of behaviour —rendering them ever more exploitable, quantifiable, controllable, and ultimately simulatable. We might name this extraction of value from dead or incorporeal flesh: necrosploitation —the extraction of value from the dead. Necrosploitation rests upon the principle that past labour, once objectified —whether as fossil fuel deposits, surveilled data trails, or stolen creative works— can be severed from the rights and claims of its originators. These congealed stores of effort are treated not as entitlements or legacies, but as a free “gift from god” —ready for expropriation under the manufactured consensus of presumed fair-use. Fossil fuels embody the stored metabolic energy of long-dead organisms. As we burn them, that energy is extracted without regard for the lifeforms that survive or the ecosystems that sustain them. Similarly, the vast datasets fuelling the machines of prediction represent the stored cognitive and creative labour of the living —scraped, aggregated, and reconstituted without consent. This aligns with Marx’s characterisation of Capital as “dead labour, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks”, yet today’s necrosploitation visits its hunger upon different bodies, the living are increasingly displaced by archives of the dead. The fossil remains of past expression are now exhumed at scale as constant capital for predictive systems. These subjects are not only denied recognition; their continued existence, intentions, and rights are treated as immaterial, as if they too were already dead. Drawing again on Mbembe’s theory of necropolitics, necrosploitation here does not merely extract from the deceased, but performs the symbolic death of the living, rendering them spectres in the data-shadows of their own stolen expression. A total economy is an unrestrained taking of profits from the disintegration of nations, communities, households, landscapes, and ecosystems. It licenses symbolic or artificial wealth to ‘grow’ by means of the destruction of the real wealth of all the world. Since the age of steam unyoked the living blood and bone of beasts of burden, Capital has been drawn instead by (and from) the phantom breath of dead carbon. Even today, 80% of global energy consumed is summoned from reserves of ancient spirit, the fossil remains of the dead. The industrial revolution saw the rising power of accumulations of the labour of the past, or what Marx termed dead labour, congealed into machines. In machinery, objectified labour confronts living labour within the labour process itself as the power which rules it; a power which, as the appropriation of living labour, is the form of capital. Here he identifies in the industrial machine a turning point in the history of Capital: the moment when objectified labour materially confronts living labour as a ruling power, absorbing the labour process into Capital’s own realisation process. Yet even in this configuration, machinery still required the cooperation of living labour, however diminished —not only to operate and maintain it, but to provide the site of value extraction through labour-time. The limit condition of industrial capitalism was therefore a residual dependency upon human input. Predictive Capital ruptures this limit through two unprecedented escalations: first, the accumulation of vast digital archives —semiotic deposits of dead labour expropriated at scale; second, the hyper-concentration of Capital sufficient to marshal planetary energy and compute infrastructures to metabolise the statistical weights held within these vast data stores. Together, they enable a shift Marx could not have foreseen: the statistical reanimation of dead labour into undead labour. This rupture in scale —of data, of Capital, of computation— enables Predictive Capital not just to model probable action, but to pre-empt and displace it, enclosing subjectivity within simulations of labour and desire. This plays out along these two entwined vectors. On one axis, Predictive Capital reanimates past labour not to generate new value through the living, but to simulate its generation —by function-approximating the shape of future value from past desire. This axis consumes and directs the platform feeds of The Apparatus of Attention —where aggregated human outputs become the training set in casting predictions of probable desire. On the other, it reanimates past labour to simulate the act of labour itself —the function-approximation not of next value, but of the next unit of labour, so casting predictions of probable intention. This governs the next-token predictions, and latent space interpolations of The Apparatus of Intention towards the emergence of so-called ‘generative’ outputs. Both axes displace the subject: the first as desiring agent, the second as labouring being. Labour no longer appears so much to be included within the production process; rather, the human being comes to relate more as watchman and regulator to the production process itself. These systems now interpolate between past actions to produce plausible continuations, thereby enacting a spectral form of productivity in which Predictive Capital appears to simulate value-creation without living labour —a fantasy of autonomy sustained in part by a hidden underclass of prompt labourers, data labellers, click-workers, and robbed content creators who, though structurally diminished, remain entangled in the apparatus as spectral auxiliaries of the machine. What was once congealed labour requiring living hands to stir it into motion is now undead labour, reanimated by planetary-scale infrastructure —not to meet human need, but to simulate desire and intention itself, and thereby perpetuate Capital’s self-expanding circuit with an ever diminishing need to recognise living workers. The result is a form of productive force alien not only to the worker, but to the very condition of life. As the forces of Capital fuel and amplify our desires, its insatiable appetite continues to indulge ours through the necromantic thrusts of fossil-capital that hump our planet into oblivion. In 2024, the average global temperature for the year rose, for the first time, more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Capital’s response? To raise global carbon emissions to an all-time high. Before we began this ongoing mass exhumation, the level of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere stood at 280ppm. It now exceeds 480ppm. This steep rise stems directly from the (by)products of Capital’s centuries-long proclivity: its macabre fixation with the labour of the dead. The rapid release of carbon sequestered over aeons by the labour of ancient flora has delivered us to the precipice of annihilation —dramatically altering the global climate, collapsing ecosystems, and accelerating the sixth mass extinction. With only depleted reserves remaining, and the consequences of their continued combustion a mounting existential threat, Capital’s substance abuse approaches its material limits —yet its appetite endures, as it always has, and now accelerates, promising to again abandon the ruins it creates and escape to the next site of extraction. Seeking new conscripts for the army of the dead it has long summoned across geological time, Capital has found other ‘graves’ to desecrate. A more recent archive of historical being: a new ‘black gold’ drawn from carbon lifeforms, not sequestered across geological time, but from the living present —compressed for anaerobic decomposition and subsequent reanimation within the necropolis of the data centre. It is these mausoleums —the crypts of our data-shadows— that Capital now visits to sate its hunger for dead flesh. The reanimation of that flesh —aggregated and compressed into necropolitan archives— fuels a recursive cycle of prediction and manipulation, wherein the labour of the dead is endlessly repurposed as the commodity form fed back to the living. These are not neutral products, but components of a weaponised Advertising Industrial Complex: a planetary-scale apparatus engineered to shape opinion, fuel desire, guide behaviour, and annihilate or abandon according to the necropolitics of profit over life. Contrary to the fantasies spun by marketing hype and the hi-tech mystique of inscrutable surfaces, Capital’s predictive turn is not some new found efficiency, temperance, or abstinence. Its outputs are not conjured effortlessly from the ether —as if plucked from the latent possibility of quantum fluctuations without cost, consequence, or labour. Capital’s necrosploitation may offer quick riches for some. Yet whether it is mining the sacred burial grounds of ancient flora and fauna, the aggregated data-shadow of modern networked being, or the lifeworks of countless human creators, Predictive Capital draws upon dead flesh. In all cases, the environmental costs of this necromantic extraction are grave. The machines of prediction require vast quantities of water for cooling and their insatiable appetite for energy already exceeds the capacity of existing clean energy infrastructure —a mismatch only set to worsen as their model size, training frequency, and ubiquitous deployment accelerate. Simply put, Capital is a necromancer. Its necromancy is not metaphorical —it is its primary drive and mode of operation. It is more than mere communion with the dead: it is the administration of death to amass an army of the undead, rolling the dice of divination across distributions of their bodies, it is the calling of the spirits to harness their labour; it is the summoning of their past to cast predictions of the future. Predictive Capitalism builds towards the ecstatic consummation of Capital’s necromantic drive. Lured by the dead flesh of data-shadows cast by the increasingly pervasive surveillance of the Advertising Industrial Complex —archived in the networked crypts of its Apparatus of Attention, platforms designed to harvest gaze, clicks, and affect— Capital summons the labour of the dead to fuel the computation of its subjects’ future desires. What appears as creation is, in fact, calibration. The archive becomes not just feedstock for consumption, but for manipulation —the repurposed remains of past labour now weaponised to anticipate, steer, and intensify the circuits of accumulation. This shift echoes Shoshana Zuboff’s identification of behavioural surpluswithin a behavioural futures market as the extractive resource of Surveillance Capitalism, but diverges in key respects. Where Zuboff focuses on the commodification of behaviour, Predictive Capital intensifies this logic —monetising not the act, but its anticipation and yet more critically, doing so through planetary scale expropriation. Here, prediction itself becomes the commodity form. What is sold is not content or even action, but the simulation of intention and desire. Predictive Capital thus becomes a fully anticipatory regime, in which the future is not merely imagined, but pre-emptively enclosed within a machinically automated instantiation of Baudrillard’s absolute advertising. As we confront the planet’s ecological and material limits, Capital’s predictive turn does not mark a shift towards sustainability, but a desperate acceleration. Capital’s new romance with dead digital flesh brings a large-scale escalation of its appetites. Rather than adapt or moderate, it has intensified its destructive rampage: automating extraction, forecasting compliance, and eliminating whatever it cannot instrumentalise or that resists its command. Under the regime of Predictive Capital, the necropolitical logic observed by Mbembe becomes overt and systematic. It now visits renewed levels of violence upon both its subjects and the planet, accelerating towards ever intensifying self-concentration and the ‘purification’ of its operational space. All that is deemed inefficient, unpredictable, or surplus to its needs —resistant life, non-compliant populations, ecological limits— is met not with accommodation, but with elimination: removal from the labour markets, from national borders, from ecosystems and homelands, from existence. Capital suddenly presents itself as an independent substance, endowed with a motion of its own, passing through a life-process of its own, in which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off in turn. Nay, more: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it enters now, so to say, into private relations with itself. In the 15th century, Portuguese colonists came upon an island dense with potential. To their capitalist eyes Madeira was the perfect vault of surplus: thick forests, fertile volcanic soils, strategic location. Already enriched by the conquest of Ceuta and the plunder of North African trade routes, the Portuguese, quickly recognised what could be extracted from this untouched island paradise. Here, sugar became the conduit for metabolising land, fuel, and enslaved labour into refined profit. Overnight, Madeira became Europe’s leading sugar exporter. Yet this ascent was soon followed by the inevitable exhaustion. The forests were razed to fire the refineries; the soil depleted; the enslaved broken. In less than a generation, the island’s reserves, its vault of surplus, was spent. The response from the Portuguese capitalists was not restoration, but departure. They moved on: to São Tomé, then Brazil, then the Caribbean. As Monbiot and Hutchison observe in recounting this tale, “Boom, Bust, Quit is what capitalism does”. The story of Madeira is not merely one of colonial ambition or imperial violence. It begins with discovery and overcoding: the reterritorialisation of a lush wild island. A monoculture then drains the soil, wealth flows outwards, and labour becomes invisible. Once depleted, the island is abandoned, its people left to inhabit the hollowed shell of once-extracted value. This is not a deviation from Capital’s logic, but a pure expression of it. It is this same logic that overfishes to leave empty, lifeless seas; that slowly reduces the number of crisps in a packet while raising the price; that injects water or bulking agents into food and sells it by weight; that cancels aid to the poorest while cutting taxes for the richest. The Portuguese did not plan Madeira’s collapse; they enacted in obeyance with Capital’s self-maximising imperatives. Forests, soils, and enslaved lives were metabolised not by pure malice or miscalculation, but through the recursive automation of accumulation. What the tale of Madeira exposes is not just Capital’s boom-bust cycles, but something more fundamental, the machinic drive of Capital itself: a restless logic that extracts surplus-value to the point of exhaustion, then abandons the carcass in search of the next victim. The driving force behind this sequence springs from a seemingly innocuous mutation in the logic of exchange itself. In Marx’s terms, in pre-capitalist societies, “simple” commodity exchange followed the circuit C–M–C: a commodity (C) is exchanged for money (M), which is then used to obtain another commodity (C) —grain for cloth, cloth for tools. Within such flows, money is a means; the end remains use. The capitalist departs from this thing for thing exchange, he finds himself not in lack but in surplus, a surplus compelled by flows of desire towards self-expansion. Marx explained that under Capital the circuit became M–C–M′: money (M) is invested in a commodity (C) only to be sold for more money than was invested (M prime). Here, the commodity is merely a conduit. The aim is no longer use, but surplus, the sole purpose: to expand from M to M’ —the circuit now predicts. Here prediction is fundamentally baked into the capitalist circuit; a prediction demands growth, anticipating more money out than is put in. Coinciding with the introduction of waged labour, or what Deleuze and Guatarri termed ‘the free slave’, this mutation marks the inception of Capital proper. In this shift from simple commodity exchange to the capitalist compulsion to make money beget more money lies the expansionary nature of Capital’s drive. Madeira was metabolised because the Portuguese followed this circuit to its logical conclusion. Once all available surplus had been extracted, not only does its logic provide no reason to stay, but compels it to leave, to move on, to locate the next untapped store of surplus. The formula ‘capital value in search of additional value’ is now understood as capital organising a process of self-valorisation (Selbstverwertung) Across the Grundrisse and the three volumes of Capital, Marx repeatedly demonstrates that Capital is the accumulated force of dead labour, which subordinates the living to its own recursive expansion and self-valorisation. In so doing, it begins to function as if it were alive —an Automatic Subject. This is not simply metaphor. Capital, he wrote, appears to “issue from the womb of Capital itself”, by mystifying the labour and resources it appropriates it “presents itself as an independent substance, endowed with a motion of its own”. In other words, through the machinery of production, interest-bearing finance, and the accumulation of what he termed the general intellect, Capital appears increasingly autonomous, self-moving, detached from the exertions of living labour. For the movement in the course of which it adds surplus-value is its own movement, its valorisation is therefore self-valorisation. By virtue of being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or at least lays golden eggs. From Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ through to Frederich Hayek’s ‘wisdom of the market’, observations of the automaticity of Capital have been foundational for generations of critical theorists seeking to understand how a system could acquire such apparent autonomy —operating, as it were, behind the backs of its subjects. Lukács saw the commodity form subsuming all relations, such that the world appears ruled by things rather than people. Adorno and Horkheimer diagnosed the rise of a totalising instrumental rationality in which even culture is bent to Capital’s logic. Marcuse showed how desire itself is co-opted into a system that generates obedience through pleasure. Debord described Capital as Spectacle —images detached from life, yet mediating and structuring it. Camatte warned that Capital had escaped human control entirely, become “a being-for-itself”, remaking the world in its own undead image. Deleuze and Guattari, described it as a desiring machine —a system that does not merely regulate desire, but produces and consumes it as part of its own self-replication. Lyotard ran with this idea declaring that “every political economy is libidinal”, that Capital is a pulsating circuit of intensities, an “insatiable desire” that traverses society. Baudrillard then mapped its evolution into a regime of free floating signifiers that simulate value even after it has smelted use value and exchange value into a self-parodying sign value. What unites these perspectives is a shared recognition: that Capital behaves as if it has agency, appetite, and will. Not because it is conscious, but because its structure exerts real, coercive effects —organising life, labour, and even thought according to its inhuman imperatives. This is not an illusion, but a material truth masked by its self-mystification. Capital, as Moishe Postone later put it, is a “self-moving substance that acts as if it were a subject”. We may trace a line through these theories, neither linear nor sequential, but from which something else emerges. Beyond their common recognition of the automaticity of Capital, lies an implicit escalation. Across epochs and vantage points, as Capital’s operations mutate, as new conditions are identified, new aspects observed, and new thresholds breached, its autonomous power of self-reproduction appears only to intensify. In Lukács, the universalisation of the commodity form; in Adorno, the subsumption of culture into exchange; in Marcuse, the integration of desire into the logic of production; in Debord, the displacement of life by representation; in Camatte, as a subject without a human face; in Deleuze, as a desiring machine; in Lyotard, a quasi-subject of desire: a system that feeds off human libidinal investment, perpetually outstripping rational or moral constraints; and finally in Baudrillard, Capital no longer even sells objects or ideas, but reproduces itself as pure signal —a semiotic compulsion without origin, function, or external limit. From there we are drawn into Fisher’s Capitalist Real, Berardi’s Semiocapitalism, Naomi Klein’s Shock Doctrine, and Jodi Dean’s Communicative Capitalism —and on, and on. Some of these observations expose aspects and dynamics latent from the outset; others register newly emergent mutations specific to phases of Capital’s advance —yet, while these theories are not always complimentary nor do they necessarily fit neatly together into a greater whole, none cancels the others. Instead they each describe aspects of Capital’s self-compounding automaticity from differing perspectives as it accelerates and intensifies its ever expanding systemic and infrastructural instantiation, and its cultural, and technological reach. Of course, Capital is not arrested under our inspection. Even as we observe the kaleidoscopic performance of its many facets, it shifts its operations, they grow in scale, momentum, appetite, and malevolence —their cadence ever more swiftly disrupting our assumptions and invalidating our conclusions even before we reach them. Its recursive logic ever deepening, Capital ceases to merely organise life, instead increasingly transforming its preconditions in advance. From its inception it has ensnared and enveloped us, each layer of its ever deepening recursion has only compounded our alienation from the real while intensifying its self-expanding operation. Marx saw dead labour as the heart of capital accumulation, arising from past labour made into the constant capital of infrastructure, machines, and tools. Industrialisation intensified this relation, as production grew increasingly dependent on the accumulation of past labour stored in constant capital form in these tools —shifting the balance of value creation from the living to the dead. For Marx, it is within interest-bearing Capital that “this automatic fetish is perfected”, because here value seems to beget value —with no visible connection to labour or production. In this self-referential form, Capital appears to expand spontaneously, as if animated by its own internal law. Capital’s extractive circuit M-C-M’ collapses into its most distilled most fetishistic form M-M′, the social relation effaced entirely, money begets money, seemingly without the mediation of production or labour, as if the circulation of value were an end in itself. Here, the capitalist becomes a mere functionary of Capital’s own motion —its priest, not its author. This is not merely financial abstraction. It is the crystallisation of a deeper logic: Capital’s self-expanding imperative. As data is continually scraped from artists, conversations, and communities it is fed into the ever-expanding corpse of the necropolitan archive. This becomes the substrate for predictive models whose very function depends upon the scale, frequency, and statistical coherence of accumulated traces. In predictive systems —accumulation is not incidental or even merely a logical imperative— statistical density becomes the metabolic driver for Capital’s machinic reproduction, increasingly replacing labour time. The larger the scale at which this statistical density can be extracted the more it inflates the valuation of that into which it is metabolised. As this sunken cost grows, so too does the need to ensure that the real never deviates from the predictions it casts. This is the new logic of self-moving value: recursive, disembodied, and automated in form. Under this schema, so-called ‘generative AI’ is exposed as an obfuscation of dead labour reanimated into what should more accurately be termed: Predictive Capital. Through a descent into pure fiction, Predictive Capital animates the circuit through statistical weight. The extractive arc of M–C–M′ has mutated once again, this time operating according to a circuit with prediction as the commodity form: M–Pr(Λ | 💀)–M′ —now routing Capital’s recursive self-expansion through the statistically conditioned derivation of prediction from the labour of the dead. Those powering these machines would have us overlook that middle clause. For them, this new circuit flows as M–hype–M′, or M–p(doom)–M′ —self valorisation routed through provocation, speculation, and hallucinated risk, each obscuring Capital’s self-expansion as the true threat. Not only does prediction here become the commodity form, the operation executed within these machines, but they are machinic instantiations of the Capitalist circuit, machines that automate its insatiable hunger, its demand for growth, and the anticipation of getting more out than was put in. Within Predictive Capital, dead labour is no longer confined to physical tools or infrastructure, but becomes symbolic, cognitive, affective —and above all, cumulative. What we now witness is not merely a real subsumption of labour, but its automated reanimation. The expropriated cognition of innumerable creators embedded in machine learning models, appears to produce outputs with ever diminishing variable capital expenditure. Thereby, the next-token prediction machines of so-called ‘generative AI’ deign to realise Capital’s self-expanding drive by instantiating its self-perpetuating logic within the silicon substrate and planetary infrastructure. At once reanimating dead labour and entraining the living to serve its self-expanding project, Predictive Capital perfects its innate necromancy within a machinically realised Automatic Subjectivity, reinforcing its dominion over human agency as a function of its predictive imperatives. That part of capital, therefore, which is turned into means of production, i.e., into raw material, auxiliary material, and instruments of labour, does not change its magnitude of value in the process of production. I therefore call it the constant part of capital. Under industrial capitalism, constant capital referred to past labour —dead labour— objectified in the form of tools, machinery, and infrastructure. While it entered the production process, it did not itself generate surplus-value. Only living labour could animate this inert material —could set dead labour to work— to create new value. Yet as the means of objectifying labour evolved, so too did Capital’s capacity to store, recall, and operationalise it. What began within our early evolution with the construction of simple tools and the extraction of raw materials eventually extended into the domain of language, notation, and the symbolic compression of cognition. Driven by Capital’s imperative to extract surplus wherever possible, the development of structural apparatus for the capture and reanimation of labour has accelerated —from written language to musical notation, industrial machines to contemporary recording, and now predictive systems that claim to capture and reanimate our cognitive labour. Observing advances in production during the industrial era, Marx recognised that increasing investment in machinery, or constant capital, lead to a relative decrease of variable capital expenditure required during production —the wages paid to living workers. As capital accumulates, it tends to concentrate in the form of means of production, shifting its ‘organic composition’: ever more of it becomes dead labour, embedded in tools and infrastructure, while the share directed to living labour decreases. This dynamic is not incidental, but intrinsic to Capital’s logic of self-expansion —a recursive strategy of accumulation that privileges scale, automation, and control over the unpredictability of living workers. Predictive Capital arrives as the latest intensification of Marx’s constant capital —dead, databased, and redeployed without the living worker, promising to reduce the proportion of variable capital expenditure demanded to generate new value until it approaches zero. This mendacious denial of the existence of labour, and the all too real diminishing expenditure on wages or remuneration for the living, do not, of course, mean that the labour is not there —yet, this is clearly the ambition. Outputs from these machines are valorised and circulated as if issued “from the womb of Capital itself”. In this, Predictive Capital aspires to the final severance of value from labour, replacing the requirement for living action with the statistical density of prior expression. It is not that the machines think, but that they harvest the afterlife of stolen thought at scale. This drive towards profits unencumbered by living labour, towards ever-larger models, ever-greater compute, and the ever-expanding fractal capture of expressive and cognitive terrain is not merely technical ambition —it is Capital’s self-maximising logic, rendered machinic. Here, the Automatic Subject is no longer a systemic abstraction but a material infrastructure with voracious appetites and accelerating autonomy. Predictive Capital emerges not as rupture, but as the crossing of a further threshold: the material transgression of an immaterial boundary, where Capital’s automaticity is no longer systemically diffuse but machinically instantiated. The hyper-concentration of Capital now combines with Baudrillard’s Absolute Advertising through the subsumption of globally networked communications and compute infrastructure by the Advertising Industrial Complex, and the planetary-scale expropriation of dead labour, to provide the preconditions necessary to cross this threshold. It is under these conditions that Predictive Capital emerges as the machinic realisation of the automatic subjectivity of Capital that Marx first observed in the industrial era. Capital has escaped us. It has become autonomous, it has become a community in itself, producing and reproducing all human relationships within its own logic. Under the regime of Predictive Capital, prediction becomes the new commodity form and we reach a further peak of commodity fetishism in which dead labour, this time accumulated in statistical models, is animated by compute to simulate the outputs of living labour. Here, labour is displaced not merely in space, but in time. Rather than congealed into machinery as dead labour it is recorded and resurrected as undead labour, so that value appearsto emerge autonomously, severed from the labouring subject entirely. Predictive Capital thus consummates the Automatic Fetish —obscuring not only the worker but the very fact of labour itself. Within this recent machinic instantiation, we may already see signs of accelerating recursion in Capital’s self-compounding automaticity —a further untethering from both the real and from expenditure on living labour, beyond what was already expropriated. Earlier models expended compute primarily during pre-training, drawing on archived human expression to build their representations. The latest so-called ‘frontier models’ increasingly consume additional compute during the alignment phase at test-time. Where previously models were subject to supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, increasing compute is now expended here through reinforcement learning on ‘synthetic data’ —that is, sequences of tokens predicted by prior models. Within this loop, prediction feeds prediction, and the archive is overwritten by its own simulation. Here, Predictive Capital’s severance from labour becomes self-reinforcing; the simulation self-replicates, its detachment from the real widens and its propensity to hallucinate intensifies. In a following section, we will explore just how far this logic extends in the conquest of chess, Go, and even algorithmic design. Yet it is critical, here at this juncture, to understand the implications of the increasing application of reinforcement learning (RL) during the development of the models that instantiate the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital. When AlphaZero ‘solved’ chess and Go, when AlphaEvolve improved the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, they did so not through insight but an inhumanly exhaustive, agentic exploration across vast possibility spaces. More critically, each search was guided by a reward signal calibrated by repeated policy updates —a process designed to reinforce the paths or actions that led to higher rewards. In other words, RL operates by defining a goal in advance, then rewarding behaviours that approximate or maximise its fulfilment. In philosophical terms, RL encodes a teleological structure: every exploratory move is ultimately judged by how well it conforms to a predetermined quantitative metric. By definition, RL demands the reinforcement of an imperative. For chess and Go, the imperative is simple: victory in the game. In matrix multiplication, it is greater efficiency through the reduction of computational operations. The reward function for commercial, general-purpose Predictive Capital will be far more complex —not bounded by well described, limited game domains. Yet across all possibilities explored, one signal will remain constant: the reinforcement of Capital’s self-expanding imperative. That AlphaEvolve first found efficiency improvements in its own code, and that the very first use of the matrix math breakthrough it located, was to optimise the efficient running of Google’s Advertising Industrial Complex, is instructive. While RL is formally agnostic, its application within Capital’s infrastructural and institutional domains inevitably aligns the reward function with its imperatives —be they click-through rates, efficiency gains, or predictive alignment with previous profit. In such systems, what is reinforced is not general intelligence, but Capital’s own reflexive logic. In Marxist terms, RL-based tuning instantiates the real subsumption of an exhaustive mapping of possibility space to Capital’s command. Predictive Capital’s sovereign subjectivity now flows and compounds with overwhelming statistical weight. Through these flows of both next-token and next-content prediction, dead labour is not reanimated discretely, but summoned en masse —a statistical enchanting that crushes the living with the accumulated weight of their own past. Human agency persists, yet when not simply discarded as statistical irrelevance, it is increasingly subordinate to simulation through the recursive hauntology of prediction. Capital no longer merely produces commodities, it produces predictable subjectivities. While instantiating the Automatic Subject, Predictive Capital, therefore also entrains its subjects to become its auxiliaries —agents of its self-replication. Like the models we feed, we too are trained through feedback —nudged, optimised, and rewarded in accordance with machinic priorities. What reinforcement learning encodes in silicon —a recursive compounding of that which advances Capital’s self-expansion— is mirrored in the apparatus that now modulate and govern human behaviour. Clicks, impressions, algorithmic amplification: these become the reward signals of social survival, aligning living desire with the imperatives of Predictive Capital. As Camatte warned, Capital does not merely dominate —it remakes the human to serve its reproduction. It moves beyond human governance to domesticate both labour and capitalists alike as mere appendages to its autonomy. Once we are no longer required as bearers of labour-time, we are repositioned as agents of circulation, validation, and signal generation —summoned to self-optimise, align with its efficiencies, perform for its algorithms, and feed the datafied corpse. This is no longer the factory floor, but a distributed conditioning apparatus in which subjectivity is formatted in advance by the statistical requirements of prediction. We become pre-individuated, filtered for legibility, and rewarded for behaviours that conform to machinic expectations. Predictive Capital becomes our judge, jury and executioner; compliance, the condition of our survival. We the automatic subjects multiply —not as autonomous entities, but as fragments of a recursive infrastructure whose purpose is to refine the simulation. In this system of diffuse calibration, we do not merely mirror the models we train; we too are trained —aligned through the reward signals of Predictive Capital in accordance with its project of self-expansion. The reinforcement learning of the flesh converges with that of the machine in preparation for our automation and our obsolescence. First the production line escaped the factory, then it patterned culture, now it slips beneath the skin. Here, prediction becomes a regime of reward-conditioned subjectivation —embedded in code, evaluated against metrics, and calibrated through feedback. Under Predictive Capital, the human is not merely displaced by the machine, but recursively reformatted by its logic —rendered machinic, programmable, and partial. Our alienation compounds in line with the degree of our automation. Andreas Malm reminds us that Capital turned to fossil fuels not merely for efficiency but to discipline labour —to rely on the dead rather than the unruly living. So too with predictive systems, Capital seeks to abandon management of a living workforce once it has expropriate their cognitive and creative dead labour into ghostly assemblage at a scale sufficient to predicttheir replacement. Necrosploitation emerges as the class logic of Predictive Capital’s necropolitics —a pursuit of profit that no longer negotiates with the living, but seeks only to outmanoeuvre them. Crucially, such extraction of labour without consent or remuneration treats human beings as an absence rather than as a presence; it renders labouring subjects as political and economic nonentities. Regardless of corporeal status, they are stripped of all rights, exploited as if deceased. Under the rule of predictive Capital, its subjects are pronounced dead on arrival —incorporeal from birth. This is an automated and recursive necropolitical subsumption —value extraction through the reanimation of prior human expression. Echoing Marx’s famous vampiric analogy, Fisher once wrote, “Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombie-maker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labour is ours, and the zombies it makes are us.” This image captures not only the violence of expropriation, but the macabre reciprocity it once entailed: Capital needed us, if only to drain us. Yet as the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital simulates the labour of the living through the remains of the dead, even that parasitic necessity begins to fray. Fisher qualified his claim —“for the moment at least, Capital cannot get along without us”— but in the predictive turn, this clause dissolves. As its escalating function approximation of our labour, gesture, and subjectivity, makes clear, increasingly, we are categorised as dependents Capital deems it can get along without —even as it forecloses alternative modes of subsistence and deepens our dependency upon the very systems its abandonment will dismantle or exclude us from. This is the asymmetrical violence of necrosploitation: not merely dispossession, but enforced dependency after the theft. The engines of prediction, tasked with calculating efficiency across populations, do not operate neutrally. The weights and metrics of Capital’s departments ofefficiency encode its necropolitical priorities: rewarding those deemed optimal (its most pliant servants), maximising extraction from the optimisable, and abandoning the rest. Fisher continued by clarifying the inverse of his temporal clause: It remains the case, however, that we can get along without it [Capital]. The parasite needs its ‘mere conscious linkages’ but we do not need the parasite. In addition to anything else, to ignore the crucial functioning of the meat in the machine is poor cybernetics. The denial of human agency is an SF fantasy, albeit one that is everywhere realising itself. Unfortunately, SF fantasy and poor cybernetics —as we have seen— are precisely what shape the ideologies spawned by the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital. Here, Mbembe’s differential abandonment shifts from political decision, to machinic instruction. Predictive Capital strips out the affective, embodied, and collective dimensions of life, treating them as noise, preserving only those fragments of the human legible to its models. In so doing, it discards not only agency, but suffering, care, memory, and resistance —the very capacities that cybernetics should account for, if it were truly concerned with feedback and adaptation rather than domination and profit. The escalating violence directed towards those already at the periphery in this phase of hyper-concentrated Capital arises not only from mounting environmental pressure, resources scarcity, or the escalating concentration of wealth leaving the majority of us competing over an ever diminishing remainder, but from the inner logic of the Automatic Subjectivity of Predictive Capital —a machinic will to ‘efficiency’ that amplifies indifference into hostility through both epistemic exclusion and statistical marginalisation. Whatever deviates from the ‘norm’ is no longer treated as exceptional, but marked as anomalous, reclassified as inefficiency to be purged, then threat to be eliminated. Here, predictive systems do not merely reflect social hierarchies; they reinforce and accelerate them, enacting a selective forgetting that deems vast swathes of life unworthy of simulation, and therefore unworthy of survival. Much of the ‘meat’ in this cybernetic system is thus ‘optimised’ into oblivion, having fallen beyond the fringe of the distributions within the models of Predictive Capital —beyond the means of prediction, outside the modes of distribution it recognises as legitimate. Those not legible as ‘efficient’ signal —nor sufficiently unresisting— are written out of the system entirely, declared obsolete by code. The living that remain will be rendered ever more machinic. As for discounting human agency or “the meat in the machine”, the now materially instantiated parasitic Automatic Subject that is Predictive Capital increasingly acts to transform the very conditions of life, ensuring that the option to “not need the parasite” recedes ever further from our view. In summary, so-called ‘generative artificial intelligence’ can be more accurately understood as Predictive Capital: an instrumentalisation of Capital’s automaticity; a machinically instantiated Automatic Subject. Similarly, Capital as a “self-moving substance that acts as if it were a subject” can itself be understood as a phantom artificial intelligence. Not because it thinks, but because the recursive structure of capital accumulation generates real systemic motion —a machinic drive that simulates intention, enacts will, rewards obedience, and punishes, abandons, or annihilates resistance. Moreover, just as Lukács warned, neither Capital’s nor Predictive Capital’s phantom objectivity constitutes real intelligence, but rather our estranged social relations reflected back to us in spectral form. Within the worlds that emerge from simple rule based systems called cellular automata, we may observe all too familiar patterns of annihilation, exhausted stillness, and runaway expansion. Itself a kind of cellular automaton, the Automatic Subjectivity of Capital operates and expands not through conscious command but in pursuit of its expansive imperative through the iterative application of simple rules across a complex grid —our societies, our psyches, our signals. Predictive Capital, however, does not merely spread across a neutral undifferentiated terrain. As it propagates, it prepares its nominated substrate in advance, formatting life for legibility, quantising and smoothing irregularities, and foreclosing that which resists inscription or remains illegible to its circuits of value. We are not pre-formatted into a grid, the real is not born capitalisable; it must be rendered as such —reduced, abstracted, categorised, and quantified. Each cell in Predictive Capital’s ledger —a post, a person, a people, a decision, a democracy, a legislature— is then evaluated and updated according to localised logic: optimise, extract, predict, discard. No singular intelligence compels this motion. Yet, through recursive propagation, a pattern emerges —sprawling, relentless, undead. The logic of accumulation replicates itself, indifferent to content, consuming and appropriating novelty, subjectivity, resistance and even negation as mere configurations of the same substrate of prediction. We are no longer simply held within the system; we are the terrain, Predictive Capital’s field of play. What appears autonomous is nothing more than the recursion of rules already written —rules that reformat us as automata. Slave labour cannot be obtained without somebody being enslaved. The word robot originates from the Slavic robota —meaning forced labour or slavery. Coined by Karel Čapek in his 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), the term was never about machines per se, but about subjugation: the reduction of sentient or semi-sentient agents to instruments of labour, stripped of agency, purpose, and rights. Today, as concentrations of capital extract vast reserves of creative and cognitive labour into the formation of next-token prediction machines, a new robota form emerges —not a machine of liberation but an architecture of subjugation. This is not pure machinic automation —the word artificial has always been as much of a misnomer as the word intelligence— but a renewed human enslavement, a new mode of forced labour. This modern slavery reprises its ancient antecedents, here we are bound not through chains, but through an algorithmic severing from alternative means of subsistence, from authorship, ownership, remuneration, even recognition. This is Capital’s new necropolitical operation: to treat the living as already-dead: not as agents, but as disavowed sources of archival matter, to be accumulated, modelled, mined, and modulated. As John Locke described in his Second Treatise, the State of Nature grants individuals property in their person and the products of their labour when combined with the resources the State of Nature also provides. Predictive Capital voids this claim. Cognitive workers are no longer recognised as subjects, but as resources. Their expressions are expropriated, their creations rendered raw material —inputs detached from personhood, recycled without right, or recourse. Reduced to an objectified status as property, we —the enslaved— are denied the capacity to ourselves hold property. What we create is no longer our own; it can simply be taken. Enslavement constitutes civil death —a condition in which the subject is stripped of legal standing, political recognition, and moral consideration. Slavery is more than physical domination. It is a metaphysical theft: the erasure of personhood itself. This is the ontological condition of robota today: not merely expropriated labour, but stolen being, conscripted into endless recombinant service in the army of the dead under the guise of automated efficiency. This is not automation in any meaningful sense —it is ritualised expropriation. Our expressions, interactions, and creative traces are reprocessed without our knowledge or control, then fed back to us as prediction. What is framed as empowerment is, in truth, a masking of alienation: the user is made to feel like a creator, yet functions only as a medium for the system’s recursive recombination. In the process, the link between producer and product is severed —a profound ontological swindle. The modern robota constitutes not merely an enslavement, but an enchantment —a subjugation that speaks in the language of liberation. In the regime of Predictive Capital, alienation reaches beyond the theft of labour or expression —it begins to unmake subjectivity itself. In the terms of Berardi, the subject is no longer constituted through production, but through subjection: captured by semiotic flows, desensitised by overstimulation, and pushed towards what he calls a nervous collapse of the social body. Under semiocapitalism, capital no longer merely exploits labour —it extracts affect, rewires attention, and commodifies the nervous system itself. The datafied self is not simply surveilled, but extracted and reified —a form of ontological dispossession echoing Berardi’s claim that Capital now captures not only expression but imagination and the very substrate of subjectivity. This is not merely economic theft. It is ontological violence. Entire games and apps are now being produced by Vibe Coders. Some even generate income from these creations. Yet their marketplace success appears to stem less from any use or enjoyment value provided than from hype, alignment with Platform Capital’s viral imperatives, and a kind of macabre rubbernecking —spectators perhaps drawn to the scene of the reported destruction of thousands of human livelihoods. For some therefore, it is a spectacle of loss; while for others, it is a fantasy of shortcut —the opening of one of those fleeting windows of opportunity. In this case, a chance to dream of creating something apparently accomplished, refined and significantly complex, but without expending the effort, making the sacrifices, or acquiring the knowledge and skills such achievements entail. Pieter Levels became one of the first to generate significant revenue from a game he admits to have Vibe Coded into existence. His MMO game, Fly Pieter, is a blocky Minecraft-esque flight sim where users commune within a 3d world, flying around endless billboards upon which Levels has sold space to advertisers. It is hard to imagine a more fitting reveal for the true operation of next-token prediction coding, than this direct extraction of ad-revenue from expropriated labour —a dystopian artefact of our cultural subsumption within the Advertising Industrial Complex. The reality —and perhaps, even the point— of Vibe Coding, as Karpathy concedes, is that to a not insignificant degree, a Vibe Coder must be willing to go along with what the prediction machine is capable of predicting. It is a surrender not only of control over the process but also the envisioned destination. To Vibe is to drift helplessly, but not smoothly. Rather, in a series of non-contiguous, staccato jumps across the latent possibility space held within the model, and there to disinter potentialities reanimated from necropolitan archives. Like users of image models before them, Vibe Coders will struggle to reach a precise, envisioned destination. Instead, they will be air dropped to destinations across the latent space summoned by their prompt and must ‘vibe’ from there —making further jumps across latent space. A Vibe Coder must accept near misses, make do with the fragments the model can give them —until stumbling upon some artefact that runs without exceptions and approximates the shape of intention. Most crucially, every abdication —of agency, comprehension, authorship— is not simply a loss. Each decision forfeited by the Vibe Coder and all users of these machines extends Predictive Capital’s rule over our cognition, creativity and culture. What is predicted, then, is not our ‘voice’ —but the voice of Capital echoing through us, modulated by pattern recognition and refined by profitability. Next-token prediction does not summon what we might wish to say, but a meaningless jumble of what has most often been said in similar statistical contexts across the corpuses of archived labour. These corpuses are not innocent, they are the sediment of cultural production shaped by decades of advertising incentive and platform logic. In this sense, next-token prediction becomes not a tool of agency, but of recursive enslavement: an aesthetic infrastructure that repackages the profitable past as an inevitable future, until even intention is reverse-engineered as an extension of Capital’s statistical will. The test of imagination, ultimately, is not the territory of art or the territory of the mind, but the territory underfoot. That is not to say that there is no territory of art or of the mind, only that it is not a separate territory. It is not exempt either from the principles above it or from the country below it. It is a territory, then, that is subject to correction – by, among other things, paying attention. To remove it from the possibility of correction is finally to destroy art and thought, and the territory underfoot as well. … . Alone, the invisible landscape becomes false, sentimental, and useless, just as the visible landscape, alone, becomes a strange land, threatening to humans and vulnerable to human abuse. Karpathy’s remarks offer a revealing glimpse into the lived phenomenology of prediction-as-production —a regime in which intention is not merely displaced, but dissolved. In his post about Vibe Coding, he continues: It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding – I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works. Attempts to position Vibe Coding within a supposed ‘great democratisation cycle‘ —analogous to the shift from darkroom to Instagram or studio to TikTok— fundamentally misrepresent the nature of this technological transition. Unlike previous shifts, which at least preserved some embodied connection between creator and medium, Vibe Coding annihilates even this increasingly tenuous connecting thread. As previously explained, the democratisation narrative serves as ideological cover, and here it provides camouflage for deeper forms of alienation: what is accessed is not a medium, but a graveyard. The user is not empowered —they are permitted only to summon, to reanimate remnants of past labour, not to create anew. Vibe Coding is not the expansion of access to a craft; it is the simulation of creative agency built atop the wholesale expropriation and necrosploitation of the craft itself. It represents a multi-layered alienation: alienation from the product (which emerges unpredictably from the model), alienation from the process (as the user cedes control and understanding), alienation from the skills and embodied knowledge of the craft, and alienation from the vast collective of other workers whose past labour is non-consensually taken to fuel the machine. Unlike previous shifts in medium, Vibe Coding parasitises the entire public corpus of prior work, in this case code, collapsing decades of labour into statistical residue. The knowledge, style, and structural sensibilities embedded in that corpus were not offered freely, but scraped without consent from years of websites, apps, posts, repositories, and tutorials authored by human beings. Some of this code and educational material will have been offered as open source but even the authors of these will likely not have consented to this specific monetisation had they only been asked. This is not democratisation, but an accumulation by dispossession that enforces the involuntary servitude of past labour and replacement of future labour. It is not new access, but new enclosure. This critique is not confined to code. Whether one is ‘vibing’ with ‘generative’ models to produce images, video, music, or prose, the same condemnation applies: without human intentionality guiding each step, without agency over process and direction, the output remains a hallucinated appropriation —an apparition of prior labour. What appears as creation is merely recombination; what seems like innovation is the regurgitation of patterns derived from the archive —even if these models can interpolate to fill gaps in between existing human knowledge with anything other than total nonsense, this is a ‘stolen ladder’ fabricated by capital for the automation of knowledge extraction. It is no use resorting to ‘the Fountain of R. Mutt defence’ by recalling Duchamp’s famous provocation —that the essence of art lies not in the skill of the hand but in the choice of the mind. By submitting a ‘Readymade’, in this case an upturned porcelain urinal, to a prestigious exhibition under a pseudonym, Duchamp elevated an ordinary object “to the dignity of a work of art”. In so doing, he questioned authorship, aesthetic convention, and the gatekeeping of institutional art. Yet as Alfred Sohn-Rethel taught us, the division Duchamp draws upon is not neutral: The division between head and hand… has an importance for bourgeois class rule as vital as that of the private ownership of the means of production. Reframed in this light, Duchamp’s gesture may not simply represent rebellion, as many readings claim, but also consolidation of intellectual authorship over manual labour —a mystification of creation that aligns negatively with Capital’s abstraction of value from labour. Within such a framing, today’s Vibe Coders extend Duchamp’s bourgeois gesture. In elevating the ill-gotten outputs of Predictive Capital to ‘found objects’, they reduce labour to mere residue. Moreover, by displacing choice itself into predictive systems, they surrender even the act of selection. This is not the liberation of expression —it is its foreclosure. Vibe Coding lacks the intention, defiance, and specificity of Duchamp’s Readymades. Vibing with these machines does not offer a new mode of creation, but a further enclosure of creative subjectivity —the surrender of authorship to machinic correlation across all modalities. Duchamp, like the generation of painters that preceded him, had adjusted to the arrival of photography. The transition provoked understandable anxiety within a profession that had held authority over representation for millennia. Yet, in simply capturing the fall of light onto photosensitive surfaces, the camera did not scrape together centuries of their artwork only to spit out recombinant forgeries of it. Unlike next-token prediction, which consolidates power within hyper-concentrations of capital, photography genuinely democratised representation —displacing, in particular, the rule of the wealthy and the church over the expensive commissioning of images. Rather than viewing the embrace of these machines as akin to Duchamp’s re-contextualisation of mass produced artefacts, it is tempting to instead conflate them with utopian visions from science fiction. Those now indulging in ‘one-shotting’ the output to their desires view these machines as devices whose operation resembles that of Star Trek’s Replicator —a machine whose users need only prompt with their desires for them to be instantly fabricated ex nihilo. Yet the critique I forward here does not rest upon the illusion that such outputs are conjured without labour. It is not the removal of labour that we must resist, especially not the meaningless or robotic kind that Capital increasingly coerces its workers into undertaking. Rather, the threat lies in the further disempowerment and pauperisation of workers, even the removal of workers themselves, and with them, the material conditions necessary for their survival. Though these systems might appear to mimic the Replicator’s frictionless ease —the illusion of near-limitless energy and instant fabrication— the resemblance is superficial and misleading. These machines are not instruments of post-scarcity magic but of post-truth spectacle. There is only fictitious abundance here. These machines are emphatic manifestations of Capital’s increasingly hyper-concentrated phase; instrumentalisations of extractive violence whose creation fundamentally depends upon and accelerates vast inequity; and whose operation far from diffusing the concentration of power, greatly entrenches it. Marx’s analysis of machinery and surplus profit affords a deeper understanding here. In the Grundrisse, he critiques the capitalist fantasy that machines, as fixed capital, are autonomous sources of wealth. He exposes how any “benefit” yielded by a new invention —such as the surplus profit enjoyed before patents expire and competition depresses prices— derives not from the machine itself, but from the displacement of living labour. The machine’s profitability rests upon the reallocation of wages saved by replacing human workers. Moreover, Marx, drawing on Ravenstone, stresses that machinery is only truly profitable when deployed en masse, when it acts not to compensate for a scarcity of labour, but to capitalise on an abundance of it. The logic of mechanisation under Capital is thus not emancipatory but extractive: it enforces the foreclosure of labour’s agency by amassing, subordinating, and ultimately expelling it. In this sense, predictive systems —like the automating machines Marx analysed— do not merely supplant individual acts of labour, but enclose the very conditions of possibility for labour and expression, converting them into closed, predictive infrastructures hostile to the survival of all that lay beyond its distributions. Another common response to Vibe Coding is the idea that this shift is merely another layer of abstraction —akin to the evolution from machine code to higher-level languages, each abstracted layer more declarative and terse than the last. This analogy does not merely fail to withstand closer scrutiny, but misses the point entirely. Abstraction, in its classical sense, was additive: it preserved the lineage of authorship, the chain of control, the presence of a thinking subject. Crucially, it allowed for dissent through descent —the ability to drop into lower layers, to interrogate, reconfigure, or reject the abstraction itself. Many prior abstractions —from GUIs to code libraries and frameworks— were no doubt designed with an eye to modularisation and labour discipline, enabling Capital to treat cognitive workers as interchangeable units. These layers greased the shift from human uniqueness to reproducible surplus, rendering them ever more standardised in operation and confined to predetermined patterns. Each layer invariably arrives as a straightened, ‘efficient’ road that tarmacs over the intricate and winding paths of the previous layer. The abstraction introduced by Vibe Coding and the machines of Predictive Capital, is of a different order. It introduces but one layer —the predictive substrate of the model— that not only encloses everything beneath but flattens it. It does not merely obscure; it obliterates. It offers neither dissent nor descent, interpretability, nor pathway back to origin. It hollows out the code of others, encloses it within a statistical corpus, and re-emits it as spectral output —severed from authorship, stripped of intention, immune to inquiry. Capital reproduces itself by greatly multiplying that which serves its interests. With this in mind, consider, once again, the spread of content within the corpuses consumed by these machines, accumulated over decades of cultural reproduction under the rule of the Advertising Industrial Complex. What is it that most determines that which emerges after metabolising the statistical weights within these corpuses; from where does each token prediction truly emerge other than the lay lines laid down and incrementally amplified by Capital? The predictions flowing from these machines will surely retrace and so compound the very flows from which they are formed —even before further attenuations are applied through additional compute in pursuit of profit. This is not an evolution of control, but a black-boxed dispossession of thought, masquerading as innovation. In this way, to Vibe Code is less like the adoption of a higher level abstraction than it is a surrender to a device that resembles Douglas Adams’s Electric Monk. The Electric Monk was a labour-saving device, like a dishwasher or a video recorder. Dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you, thus saving you the bother of washing them yourself, video recorders watched tedious television for you, thus saving you the bother of looking at it yourself; Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe. Yet, as Dan McQuillan notes, machine learning systems are not neutral decision tools but “generate forms of epistemic violence that foreclose the possibility of alternative futures”. These systems ride roughshod over suppressed or marginalised perspectives by encoding the biases of past data and automating decisions without accountability. In so doing, they do not merely fail to understand the user’s intention —they erase it. This is not only alienation from the product of one’s labour, but from the very possibility of labour as self-directed, deliberative, or expressive. What remains is not choice but machinic interpolation: the user’s gesture absorbed into a statistical fold, returned only as simulacrum. Predictive systems do not simply abstract away the labouring subject —they discipline the possibility of contestation itself. McQuillan writes that machine learning systems produce “a growth in learned helplessness among data subjects, who are unable to comprehend the decisions that are being made, unable to discuss them meaningfully with others and unable to effectively dispute them”​. These systems institutionalise what Miranda Fricker calls epistemic injustice —not only testimonial injustice, where a subject’s account is discounted, but hermeneutical injustice, in which the conditions for making sense of one’s experience are structurally withdrawn​. McQuillan further argues that such systems enact injustices by denying marginalised groups the capacity to be heard or understood on their own terms. This constitutes not merely epistemic injustice but symbolic foreclosure —in Lacan’s sense, where the subject is not interpellated by language, but excluded from the Symbolic order altogether. For Lacan, to be interpellated is to be called into being by language —to become a subject through symbolic recognition. Yet predictive systems simulate coherence with no entry point for the subject. They simulate linguistic interpellation while denying its function, offering responses without address, outputs without encounter. What results is not mis-recognition but ontological disqualification —a structure in which the subject is not hailed, but pre-empted and overwritten, excluded from both recognition and reply. Prompting is not, therefore, a new form of higher-level programming. The Vibe Coder, like all users of prediction machines, does not act as author but as medium or summoner: an operator of systems built on the entombed, dismembered labour of others, casting prompts as incantations into the latent space of archived labour. The results are not authored creations but manifestations, statistical echoes drawn from the archive of the dead (or the treated-as-dead) —uncanny, partial, and beholden to the statistical distribution within the model. This interaction is not dialogue but séance: a necromantic practice reliant on the reanimation of expropriated expression. Predictive Capital opens no terrain of new possibility, rather, just as Platform Capital does, it encloses that which was already mapped. This marks the beginning of an eternal sentence to interment within a new phase of fictitious capital, where Capital’s ontological swindle confines traversals through the possible to what is predicted to be most profitable, where, as Marcuse warned, “one-dimensional thought” prevails and Capital’s hegemony becomes increasingly incontestable. To prompt, then, is to participate in a necromantic ritual. It is not a form of authorship, but of (re)animation. The user is not a developer but a summoner —conjuring the reanimated remnants of past cognition. The system responds not with understanding but with predictions, producing that which appears viable according to its internalised distributions. The user may guide, but never direct; may react, but never author. The relationship is not one of dialogue, but of séance, of possession —a one-way channeling of spectral output from a black-boxed archive. This is not progress, but a phase shift in dispossession —one that began not with keyboards, but with the severing of root systems, the torching of forests, the tarmacking over of the palimpsest of wisdom inscribed into the land, and the depletion of memory nourished in soil. Part 3 There is an underlying assumption that each of us aspires to be as productive as possible, and that stripping away everything seen to interfere with productivity is a good thing. Before the feudal lord drew the boundary of the field, even before the peasant stewarded land under obligation, there existed deeper, older ways of living —ones marked not by alienation but by intimate relation. These were not lives spent accumulating surplus or building abstract systems, but forms of embedded attention, sustained over generations, in harmony with land, season, and story. Wendell Berry, in his reflections on early American colonisation, contrasts two worldviews: the indigenous cultures who lived “by an intricate awareness” of the land, and the settler road-builders who “knew but little” —those who razed the ancient hickory forests of Kentucky in the late 18th century not out of necessity, but to build giant bonfires to heat the open air and light the night. They could forego the need for overnight shelter, Berry remarks, because they could burn abundance itself —setting ablaze towering pyres of felled ancient forest. This act becomes emblematic of a broader shift: a new relation to land defined not by reverence but by rupture​. Far from making a small shelter that could be adequately heated by a small fire, their way was to make no shelter at all, and heat instead a sizeable area of the landscape. The idea was that when faced with abundance one should consume abundantly —an idea that has survived to become the basis of our present economy. It is neither natural nor civilised, and even from a ‘practical’ point of view it is to the last degree brutalising and stupid. Paths, Berry reminds us, were once acts of humility, respect and intimacy, habits of foot and mind worn gently into the earth —an ancient caress along the delicate folds of the land. These routes, shaped by centuries of connection, a palimpsest of accumulated wisdom, were neither seen nor sensed by the road-builders. Blinded and deafened by industrial arrogance, themselves armed and fashioned by Capital into blunt instruments of violence, they struck directly through the living weave of land and memory. Even when not clearing ways for roads, they felled ancient life, hacking it down to brawl by firelight as bright as day, utterly indifferent to the majesty of what they had destroyed, its history, and the tragedy of its loss. Yet their ignorance belonged to Capital. That which was destroyed here lay beyond Capital’s apparatus of capture so remained illegible to its circuits of extraction. What could not be instrumentalised or circulated as value was ignored by design: erased not by oversight, but in obeyance with structural imperatives. Roads are the embodiment of resistance to place. “A path obeys the natural contours”, Berry writes, while “a road seeks to go over the country, not through it” destroying all that lies in its way. Where the path listens and bends to place; the road ignores and brutalises it. The first roads through Kentucky, then, were not merely lines of travel —they were incisions, scars upon the living landscape, emblems of an economy to come​. In another parable, Berry describes a rusting bucket hung on a fencepost, quietly collecting leaves, droppings, feathers, decay. Returning to it over decades, he observes the life that visits it, the life it increasingly sustains, and its eventual production of humus —earth itself. This, he remarks, is the “most momentous thing” he knows: the slow, miraculous process of building life-giving soil. This bucket becomes a symbol not only of natural cycles and the accretion of earth, but of what human culture once was —the careful accumulation of memory, nutrient, and relation. “However small a landmark the old bucket is, … it is irresistibly suggestive in the way it collects leaves and other woodland sheddings as they fall through time. It collects stories … It is doing in a passive way what a human community must do actively and thoughtfully.” “A human community” Berry writes, “must build soil, and build that memory of itself —in lore and story and song— that will be its culture. These two kinds of accumulation, of local soil and local culture, are intimately related.” When this relation is severed, when the bucket is replaced with asphalt, and algorithm, something incalculable is lost​. This is a truth I have known since I was just six years old. Behind my childhood home lay an unkempt wasteland —a wilderness of paths through meadows and tunnels through brambles. It was a haven where I spent formative days meeting the life it sustained. Butterflies drifted through the grasses, crickets sang, and clouds of grasshoppers leapt into the air at my every step. Then, seemingly overnight, it was gone —erased and replaced by a maze of tarmac and houses each indistinguishable from the next. The Indians and the peasants were people who belonged deeply and intricately to their places. Their ways of life had evolved slowly in accordance with their knowledge of their land, of its needs, of their own relation of dependence and responsibility to it. The road builders, on the contrary, were placeless people. That is why they ‘knew but little.’ Having left Europe far behind, they had not yet in any meaningful sense arrived in America, not yet having devoted themselves to any part of it in a way that would produce the intricate knowledge of it necessary to live in it without destroying it. Because they belonged to no place, it was almost inevitable that they should behave violently toward the places they came to. We still have not, in any meaningful way, arrived in America. And in spite of our great reservoir of facts and methods, in comparison to the deep earthly wisdom of established peoples we still know but little. I’d rather swim in this cacophony of a million contradictory voices than drown in the smooth and plausible lies of those genocidal authors of history Chris Wickham’s scholarly tome, The Donkey and the Boat, offers a fundamental reorientation of our understanding of the Mediterranean economy between 950 and 1180. Overturning prior fixations upon the glamour of long-distance maritime trade and prestigious centres of commerce like Venice, Wickham foregrounds the material infrastructure of everyday economic life: the donkey. This is more than a methodological point —it is a political and ontological assertion. Wickham insists that to understand value circulation in the Mediterranean, one must begin not with the silks of the Silk Road or the spice-laden cargo of Genoese ships, but with bulk goods, short-distance exchange, and the peasant labour and beasts of burden that transported them across land. In this framing, the donkey emerges as a figure of embeddedness, transparency, and material groundedness —in stark contrast to the opaque, disembodied flows of elite Capital and luxury goods. Local, short-range transport —slow, uneven, and peasant-operated— becomes not a peripheral detail, but the foundation of feudal value circulation. His reframing shifts our attention away from empire and exchange, and towards the lived material conditions and specific social relations between lords and peasants. Where Berry mourns ancient indigenous paths overtaken by roads, Wickham returns us to a time before Capital’s rampage of colonial erasures began. Both remind us, from different vantage points, that Capital’s alienations started not just in industrial factories, but the moment we severed paths of careful embeddedness for roads of heedless extraction. A central insight of Wickham’s account is the structural separation between elite surplus extraction and peasant subsistence production. Elites —defined by Wickham as “anyone who is living off the surplus of others”— remained largely external to the production process. Although they imposed rents in kind or labour, they neither managed what peasants planted, dictated when they worked, nor controlled the tools or methods they employed. This separation granted peasants a high degree of autonomy over the labour process. Their agriculture was oriented towards subsistence rather than accumulation, grounded in careful stewardship of the land and shaped by local ecological conditions. In Marxist terms, alienation was minimal: the peasant typically owned their tools, worked the land they inhabited, and maintained strong ties to both community and environment. Let us not get misty-eyed with nostalgia for this period, certainly not for the extreme concentration of wealth and power. Neither should we cultivate illusions about the harsh realities of the brutally brief life of a peasant under feudalism. Still, the mode of production within this period preserved what Marx would call the species-being of labour: work remained meaningful, embedded in life-sustaining rhythms rather than abstract surplus extraction. Wickham puts the matter succinctly: lords “do not have a structural role in production,” and any efforts to directly interfere in agricultural practice “seldom lasted”. The extraction of surplus was imposed through social and political means, but the practical production of value remained in the hands of the peasantry. Farming was carried out for survival, not for markets; the rhythm of life was determined more by the seasons than by circuits of capital. The metabolic rift between humans and nature —outlined by Marx and later named and expanded by John Bellamy Foster— had not yet been forced open. Foster describes this rift as the ecological rupture created when Capital interrupts the sustainable circulation of nutrients between humanity and the earth, transforming balanced cycles of renewal into linear processes of extraction and depletion. Under feudal subsistence, peasants maintained the integrity and balance of these cycles, as their very survival depended upon understanding the limits of the soil and extracting only what was sustainable —a deep knowledge and relationship of care developed over millennia. The transition to capitalist modes of production violently disrupted this careful balance, initiating a profound alienation not merely from labour, but from the land itself. In Marx’s early writings, this would mark a mode of life largely unalienated from the essential human essence, or species-being. Labour was not yet something estranged or externally imposed, arising instead from an intimate relation to the land. It was an activity embedded in subsistence, environment, and community. The peasant was not alienated from their product, their tools, or their process. As such, the full machinery of alienation —as Marx would later diagnose it under capitalism— had not yet been set in motion. The arrival of capitalist modes of production shattered these lifeworlds, replacing subsistence with accumulation. This initiated a profound shift in both the locus of power and the lived experience of labour. Where feudal elites extracted surplus from outside the process of production, capitalists embedded themselves within it —encroaching ever more deeply into the internal organisation of labour they reshaped it to serve the logic of accumulation. Under what Marx termed real subsumption, both labour and nature are absorbed into capital’s circuits —not merely as external supports, but as fully reorganised elements, disciplined and recomposed to maximise profit. To fully grasp the depth of capitalist alienation that follows, it is crucial to understand what was lost: not only subsistence, but an entire mode of embedded, autonomous existence. Part 4 Capital is no longer a political economy, it is a hyperreality of value —a code without a subject. When claims on future value circulate independently of the labour that might one day substantiate them, such paper promises —bills of exchange, bonds, derivatives— acquire reality not through the production of commodities, but through their exchangeability, their capacity to be bought, sold, and leveraged in advance of any actual valorisation. In this sense, all Capital is fictitious: its value does not rest upon present utility, it is not grounded in what is, but on the anticipation of future surplus from exploitative extraction. In the neoliberal era, this untethering accelerated: currencies floated, credit default swaps metastasised, pulling global capitalist society ever more deeply into a vortex of speculation. Capital had located new frontiers of expansion, not through increases in production, but within finance and the commodification of risk itself. The rise of Fictitious Capital coincided with the digital turn: the reduction of the world to code, then to data. Baudrillard was alert to this flattening —where sign-value overtakes use or exchange value in pursuit of equivalence towards absolute commutability. Aided by increasing deregulation, Fictitious Capital grew through the accelerating circulation of financial instruments, derivatives, and debt portfolios. This descent into fiction warped the logic of accumulation altering Capital’s circuit: from M–C–M′ to M–(M′)–M″, where the commodity is no longer produced, only anticipated, hyped, or signalled —pure speculation of surplus-value or collapse here operates to summon profit from hype and fear. The emphasis of Capital’s logic had shifted. For holders of Capital to accumulate, it was no longer necessary to invest in the present while anticipating a greater return, instead they could merely speculate on the future and watch their investments magically inflate, both through the hot air of hype and the yet more inflammatory pumps of crisis and shock. Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine (2007) outlined how crises are systematically exploited to advance capitalist interests. Her thesis was almost immediately borne out by the economic response to the financial crisis of 2008, and then overwhelmingly reaffirmed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both cases disaster was leveraged to accelerate the transferal of wealth into existing hyper-concentrations of Capital —enriching the already rich by impoverishing everyone else. Trump’s tariffs and crypto corruption should be viewed within this same lineage —as operating in service of the kleptocratic intensification of wealth inequity. For McQuillan, data‑driven prediction inherits this same speculative engine. Captured data, he writes, “becomes an asset class with both use‑value and speculative financial value”, while pervasive modelling “creates a fluctuating market in citizen futures”. McQuillan stresses that such systems “bet on correlations, not on causations” —a lineage that runs from Francis Galton’s invention of statistical correlation straight to his eugenic fantasies. Moreover, within machine learning, as McQuillan explains, stochastic gradient‑descent supplies the calculus for conflation that allows anything —from a grocery receipt to a biometric pulse— to be folded into a single tradable probability vector. This is a precaritising logic that depends on the decomposition of that which was previously whole (the job, the asset, the individual life) so that operations can be moved into a space that’s free of burdensome attachments to the underlying entity, whether that’s the fluctuating price of actual commodities or the frailty of the actual worker. Fictitious Capital’s escalation laid the conceptual and economic groundwork for its own intensification through the Predictive Turn. Just as derivatives abstract and speculate upon the value of underlying assets, Predictive Capital metabolises accumulated statistical weight, applying this logic across every domain touched by digital infrastructure. It does not merely extend speculation to the terrain of subjectivity —it subsumes the entirety of fictitious capital: finance, logistics, health, policing, insurance, and beyond. Every field governed by Capital’s anticipatory logic is now rendered a site of prediction and optimisation. Human intention, social behaviour, and large-scale policy and decision-making are disassembled into data-flows and reconstituted as objects of control. Here, what Capital extracts is not surplus-value from work, but surplus-predictability from patterned signal. Under Predictive Capital, culture merges with finance, public governance fuses with statistical surveillance, warfare with ad targeting, and the future itself becomes a collateralised asset class. Captured data, and the computational systems able to exploit it, attract venture capital and financial valuation in anticipation of further efficiencies, or even an eventual monopoly of full automation. The data becomes an asset class with both use value and speculative financial value (van Doorn and Badger, 2020). The feedback loop of machine learning means that each new adaptation by workers to self-optimise under precarious conditions becomes absorbed into the next model, which is then advertised as a rationale for the next round of funding. The data derivatives become forms of financialised assets in themselves, dependent on a continual ramping up of exploitation and expropriation as a form of performance for investors. What began as feudal rent extraction by lords external to production, then shifted to the internalised command of capitalist market forces directing every step, has given way to a yet more profound transformation: Capital no longer merely organises labour —it seeks to anticipate it, simulate it, and ultimately pre-empt it. This marks the point at which Fictitious Capital spills into the territory of Predictive Capital, and finance becomes pure simulation. It is not just the future that is manufactured and wagered upon, but the subjectivity of those who consume simulations of it. Through massively parallel reinforcement learning loops running in simulated environments —entire virtual robot fleets iterate towards the successful performance of tasks across synthetic permutation space— Predictive Capital now rehearses the execution of labour before a single finger is lifted. The productive body is no longer just anticipated; it is computationally overwritten. What was once the human worker is now but a statistical path, a single trace among millions within a vast training set —now pre-empted, automated, and effaced. This machinic rehearsal of embodied labour finds its analogue in the generative interface, where fleets of vibe coders navigate cultural permutation space, guided by next-token prediction towards outputs statistically aligned with Capital’s projections of virality and profit. Here too, Predictive Capital simulates and optimises labour in advance —not by enacting tasks in simulated physics, but by hallucinating meaning through recombinatory cultural residue. In both cases, Capital commands a dual army: one robotic, one affective, each trained to mine value from latent space —each a speculative agent of fictitious capital incarnate. Coined by John McCarthy in 1956 as a money-making exercise, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ was always deeply misleading. Of the many problems it poses —not least of which the contention that each of its constituent words lay false claims— the most insidious is its implication of a self-contained entity, detached from human labour and dissociated from Capital. In reality, what circulates under the banner of ‘AI’ is inseparable from both: it is a computational manifestation of accumulated cognitive dead labour and hyper-concentrated Capital. More accurately, these systems should be understood as Predictive Capital amplified by vast energy expenditure and overinflated by speculative hype —a murderous mutation of Fictitious Capital. As financialisation deepened across the last decades of the 20th-century, so too did the mechanisms of control. Corporate tax rates fell, wealth taxes evaporated, and public assets were privatised —funnelled into growing concentrations of Capital. Meanwhile, the burden of debt —student loans, mortgages, credit cards— was transferred onto households. Labour, increasingly precarious and disaggregated, was bound to Capital not just through employment, but through the leverage of personal debt. Discipline was no longer wielded solely in the factory —it arrived through the mailbox, the credit report. This was not a retreat of the state but a reorientation. Under neoliberalism, the state became the guardian of markets, not of citizens: enforcer of austerity, suppressor of collective resistance, and guarantor of Capital’s continuous circulation, zealot of its concentration. Welfare systems were dismantled; what remained was restructured around conditionality and surveillance. Alienation, once confined to the workplace, now bled into every sphere of life —housing, education, healthcare, and even time itself. David Harvey identifies this moment as the onset of “universal alienation”—the saturation of all aspects of life by the logic of commodification. Individuals were not only estranged from their labour, but from their communities, their environments, and even their imagined futures. The figure of the worker was increasingly replaced by the debtor, the consumer, the data subject —each stripped of agency, each enfolded into the extractive systems of Capital. Our economic function no longer merely shaped our personal identity —it replaced it. Capital forever bends the arc of production towards compounding alienation —from the indigenous path-walkers and soil-builders of Berry’s Kentucky, through Wickham’s peasant steward, embedded in seasonal and social rhythms, past Tooker’s visions of bureaucratic limbo, to today’s generative peasant: alienated from their creations, their past, and their being. This is not a nostalgic lament but a structural mapping of Capital’s expanding reach. This alienation intensifies as Capital embeds itself into every node of production, exerting command not through direct ownership alone, but via capital investment, managerial oversight, and technological mediation. Workers become appendages to machines, and eventually to systems. The result is a society in which labour is abstracted, disembodied, and increasingly invisible. This hidden and dispersed labour force —invisible but as yet indispensable— signals a shift not only in the sites of extraction, but in the very objects of labour. It is no longer material goods alone that Capital exploits, but cognitive, affective, and symbolic life itself. Again we return to the terrain of Berardi’s semiocapitalism. Here, signs, images, and affects become the principal objects of labour and production, while the very substrate of subjectivity becomes a site of extraction. Language itself is instrumentalised, and the cognitive capacities of subjects are subsumed into Capital’s circuits until all speech must pass through them and being heard becomes increasingly conditional on submitting to Capital speaking through you. Participation is no longer freely chosen, but compelled by a system that exhausts resistance, forecloses alternatives, and presents self-modulation as the only viable path through the cognitive and affective regime it imposes. This stage of capitalism bridges historical materialism with the emergence of the platform economy, where value is extracted not from material goods alone, but from data flows, attention spans, and predictive signals. It marks the transition from industrial exploitation to non-consensual semiocapitalist expropriation, where symbolic labour, cognitive output, and cultural artefacts become primary sites of surplus extraction. The feudal lord once stood outside the field, demanding a share of each harvest. Then the capitalist opened the gate and stepped inside, not to till the soil, but to bind the land to the market —replacing obligation with incentive, surplus with profit, seasonality with popularity, rhythm with rate. As production scaled, so too did Capital’s reach. Layer upon layer of oversight descended upon the worker —not to support, but to ‘optimise’ for ‘efficiency’ and extraction. From the loom to the assembly line, alienation deepened. The managerial class emerged: overly compensated to ensure their estrangement from the workers, elevated not for skill but to reinscribe feudal hierarchies of lord over peasant, bourgeois over proletariat, and so preclude solidarity with those they manage. Yet they too are hounded by their own lord at the gate. Their authority hollowed by quant —metrics, targets, KPIs— they answer directly to Capital’s recursive appetites. Once the material world was fully enclosed, the only path left for the Automatic Subject of Capital’s self-maximising project was a departure into ever deepening layers of fiction and abstraction —a speculative turn that does not eliminate material violence, but merely displaces it. So began its push into an immaterial realm beyond fiat currency, where —guided by the logic of the derivative— stock valuation became untethered from the real, inflated by a new phantom breath. During this descent into fiction, Capital breached a critical threshold of concentration, beyond which it collapsed into hyper-concentration —a state we might term its Dark Capital form. This is the inevitable culmination of its tendency to subordinate all matter to the dominion of exchange, all difference to the logic of interpolation, all life to the automatisms of accumulation. From here the self-compounding nature of hyper-concentrations of Capital picked up speed, accelerating towards ever higher concentration and increasing inequity. Having evaded, diluted, and dismantled antitrust laws, the tech monopolies approached absolute rule, enabled by neoliberal free-market radicalism, and fuelled by data as the new black gold. Briefly, the fields became whiteboards; the furrows, sprints. As the cult of Digital Capital captured our very souls, we stood in daily worship in the Church of Agile, intoning kumbayas in the prayer-circle of planning —a black mass to summon the Dark Lord of Efficiency. Here, reflection became reporting; iteration, surveillance —each practice hollowed, each gesture rendered performative, futile. These are the worker standardisations, roboticisations, and disenfranchisements that come packaged as empowerment; dependency and enslavement dressed as liberation through timetable flexibility and zero-hour contracts. What we have is not a direct comparison of workers’ performance or output, but a comparison between the audited representation of that performance and output. Inevitably, a shortcircuiting occurs, and work becomes geared towards the generation and massaging of representations rather than to the official goals of the work itself. As Marx long ago observed, in its quest for self-maximisation through ‘optimisation’ and ‘efficiency’ Capital decomposes the labour process into ever smaller, more modular units —fragmenting work until it can be mechanised, then digitised, then simulated through prediction. Control first became automated then algorithmic, exercised not only through command but through pattern: the eradication of independent thought through the homogenisation of tools and frameworks, endless process and reporting, the timed comfort breaks of warehouse workers, the algorithmic quotas and wages of gig drivers and microtaskers. The mindless task feed for the precariat drips down as ever-thinning digital-workhouse gruel —force-fed to those rendered too precarious to refuse, a dehumanising purgatory, the slow death of a million cuts, Capital’s control, totalised. Capital now pushes into our innermost worlds: its logic slips beneath our skin, embeds in our minds, and promises to simulate the self through the colonisation of language, memory, pattern, subjective affect, attention, and intention. Predictive Capital collapses exteriority, leaving no realm beyond its projected dominion —no field of production inviolate, no ancient forest spared, no life-giving or life-taking decision sacrosanct. For Marx, the capitalist was never simply a sovereign individual but Capital personified —an agent of its needs, compelled to expand surplus-value or die. Even at the height of industrial capitalism, the capitalist class was already subject to the impersonal logic of accumulation. Yet under Predictive Capital, this compulsion becomes total. The elite no longer direct Capital to serve their interests; they arise only through complete submission to its imperatives. They are no longer masters of the system, but hollowed out expressions of it —undertakers of necromantic extraction, not sovereigns above it. This is not to say they do not enjoy vast privilege, of course. Yet that privilege is contingent upon total capitulation to the logics of Capital and its self-maximising rule. As the political right are fond of reminding us, “politics is now downstream from culture”, yet this is a strategic misdirection from the fact that culture is increasingly downstream from Capital. Curtis Yarvin, writing as Mencius Moldbug, popularised a pseudo-structuralist version of this argument with his theory of The Cathedral: a conspiratorial abstraction of liberal hegemony said to be propagated by elite universities, legacy media, and the civil service. To Yarvin, The Cathedral is not merely a cultural force but an illegitimate sovereign —one that must be overthrown and replaced with a ‘formalist’ regime grounded in authoritarian hierarchy. The irony, of course, is that while Yarvin poses as a dissident thinker railing against power, his framework functions to conceal the operations of actual Capital, reassigning its systemic effects to a scapegoated cultural superstructure. In so doing, he displaces critique from class to culture, and offers a fantasy of rebellion that leaves the economic engine of dispossession untouched. Yarvin’s sprawling 2008 manifesto, “An Open Letter to Open-Minded Progressives”, framed egalitarianism not as a social good but as the root of civilisational decline. As a self-described “dark elf” of the Dark Enlightenment, Yarvin decries democratic institutions, advocates for authoritarian rule by a Sovereign CEO, and identifies liberal values —especially those grounded in empathy and equality— as societal weaknesses in need of purging. These proposals may masquerade as radical, but as is now only too clear, their implementation only deepens pre-existing societal imbalances: further centralising decision-making, widening hierarchical divides, and consolidating Capital. Despite his disdain for the democratic façade, Yarvin remains structurally committed to Capital’s imperatives —his proposals merely strip away the liberal mask to reveal the already intensifying domination of hyper-concentrated Capital. That his admirers include Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and J.D. Vance only reinforces the point: the new ideologies emerging from the political right and the boardrooms and think tanks of Silicon Valley, do not subvert Capital’s rule or halt its hyper-concentration —they intensify it, while indulging a superficial cosplay of dissent for a loyal precariat desperate for change. What Yarvin, the reactionary right, and their tech billionaire patrons propose is not change but the final severance of the illusion of a fair society —to drop all pretence of striving toward equality, simply because they do not believe we are equal, or that our lives hold equal value. They will, of course, continue to brandish the banner of ‘equal opportunity’ when it comes to access to their surveillance infrastructure —equal opportunity to be legible to the machine has their full backing. All the while, they lobby for cuts to welfare, public education, foreign aid, and, naturally, to the taxes they themselves might otherwise owe. Under Capital’s reign, there is always money for war, for bailing out banks, for maintaining the uninterrupted flow of value —always money for the next extractive technology— but never to ensure that every one of us has shelter, or that no child ever goes hungry. Capital’s emissaries, its dark elves, never truly argue not for rupture, but now push for absolute coronation —even to the point of crowning themselves or one of their cohort as monarch, their likeness to be stamped upon the symbols of Capital just as Capital has stamped its likeness upon them. Across the first decades of the third millennium we have grown ever more acclimatised to the deepening enclosure of the Capitalist Real. As Capital’s hyper-concentration intensifies, its forces now accelerate towards a more totalised rule. What once operated systemically —through diffuse political, cultural, and economic structures guided by corrupt neoliberal, free-market, anti-competitive policy making— is now to be formally and machinically instantiated: rendered as explicit regime, as the architecture of a new thousand-year Reich. As Ava Kofman details in her profile of Yarvin, his true contribution has been to shift the Overton Window and revive “ideas that once seemed outside the bounds of polite society”. On a podcast with his friend Michael Anton, now the director of policy planning at the State Department, Yarvin argued that the institutions of civil society, such as Harvard, would need to be shut down. “The idea that you’re going to be a Caesar . . . with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly absurd”, he said. On his blog [Unqualified Reservations], he once joked about converting San Francisco’s underclasses into biodiesel to power the city’s buses. Then he suggested another idea: putting them in solitary confinement, hooked up to a virtual-reality interface. Whatever the exact solution, he has written, it is crucial to find “a humane alternative to genocide”, an outcome that “achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society) but without any of the moral stigma Speaking in 2010 at Libertopia, Peter Thiel, —PayPal billionaire and co-founder of Palantir, the demonic, black-ops heart of Predictive Capital— provided an early warning of much that was to unfold across the following years: The basic idea was that we could never win an election on getting certain things because we were in such a small minority. But maybe you could actually unilaterally change the world —without having to constantly convince people, and beg people, and plead with people who are never going to agree with you— through a technological means. And this is where I think technology is this incredible alternative to politics. It is reasonable to view this moment as signalling a shift in the global culture war that had arguably intensified 40 years prior in response to the student uprisings of the 1960s. In this speech, Thiel articulates the strategic mutation that would come to define the end of the neoliberal era and the start of the next: the abandonment of persuasion and consensus in favour of a politics of myth delivered through a unilateral technological imposition. Technology, in Thiel’s formulation, becomes a tool not to serve democracy, but to circumvent it and eventually dismantle it entirely. From this toxic root, much of the upheaval that has followed can be traced. The ideologies shaped by Capital, liberated from the friction of political accountability, accelerated the hyper-concentration of wealth and the erosion of collective agency. In their wake, we have witnessed the global resurgence of the political right —perpetually beholden to Capital; the calamity of Brexit; the escalating scapegoating of those already at the periphery for the ever deepening austerity for which they are, of course, blameless; the ascendancy of Trumpist authoritarianism; and a mounting genocidal body count: from Ukraine and Gaza to Myanmar, Armenia, Yemen, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. What Thiel signalled was not merely a strategy, but a hybrid-war against the very conditions of democratic life —a war we are losing. A decade and a half later and Capital’s elites now sequester themselves into increasingly fortified enclaves to worship their growing fortunes, while America is run as a corporation by a sovereign CEO with a fascistic and corrupt, self-enriching agenda —this is hyper-concentrated Capital vs everything else, with its R&D laboratory in Palestine. At every escalation of our state of permacrisis a new normal is established. Despite the consistent trajectory and accelerating pace, our normalcy bias continues to persuade us that things cannot get worse. The Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm has already wrought horrific polarisation and ideological isolation, but this will be as nothing compared with the devastating impact of Predictive Capital’s new anthropomorphised instantiations of it. As the echo chamber tightens, human cognitive biases will be totalised, and all relation will be replaced and reduced to the single operation of machinic Capital until we are hermetically sealed off from each other as demographics of one. Ushering us towards this fate, the self-serving political class and the Big Tech Broligarchy are increasingly indistinguishable —in both person and operation— their every utterance a marketing campaign feeding Capital’s Post-Truth malaise. With each overhyped press release, they seek not to inform but to manufacture consent —distorting our shared sense of reality in service of shareholder profits and political gains. Through this lens, Altman himself increasingly resembles that other apocalyptic-salesman of maniacal faith: Tony Blair. In 2016, OpenAI released Universe —a software platform for training and testing reinforcement learning models. The platform granted these models access to the “world’s supply of games, websites and other applications”, allowing them to use these: “like a human does”. The stated goals of the project are unabashed: “We must train AI systems on the full range of tasks we expect them to solve, and Universe lets us train a single agent on any task a human can complete with a computer”. This approach, of course, echoed the global enrolment of humanity as agents of the Advertising Industrial Complex in ‘solving’ maximum engagement through minimum ad-spend towards Capital’s self-reproduction. Put simply, by exhaustively mapping —and thereby staking a claim to—the possibility space of human–computer interaction (HCI) as constituted by the world’s games and websites, these agents were expected to ‘solve’ the domain of HCI itself, even to generalise this mastery across unseen but sufficiently similar digital terrain. This was perhaps a harbinger of a future where, for the few, human labour becomes akin to playing a real world version of Universal Paperclips, orchestrating swarms of next-token prediction agents and allocating the scarce resources they need for the extraction of value and the conversion of everything into Predictive Capital. More recently, early announcements of OpenAI’s video generation model Sora, were accompanied by claims that, through training on countless hours of video footage —including a not insignificant amount of computer gameplay recordings— it had developed a “world model”. As if a grasp of Newtonian dynamics or Euclidean geometry had simply emerged; evidenced, presumably, by the model’s ability to predict tokens that simulate their effects —and lest we forget, “if you can’t tell the difference, how much do you care?” Such claims of emergent equivalence are, as we have seen, a defining feature of the violent erasure enacted by these machines and the hype surrounding them —an erasure that is at once ontological, epistemic, symbolic, and material. The detachment of his machines from the real apparently having long slipped beneath his own skin, Altman’s capacity for hype grows ever more factually unbounded. In one interview, he professed a belief that he holds “not literally”,but as a “spiritual point” —that he and his cohorts have “stumbled on” the discovery that “intelligence is an emergent property of matter”. Of course. ‘Intelligence’ emerges as a property of matter in much the same way as ‘Weapons Of Mass Destruction’ emerge as property of distant regimes, or as terrorists are said to lurk in the basement of Gazan schools, hospitals, and the very minds of Palestinian children. Each claim is equally bogus, made purely to justify the enclosure of territories of strategic import to the accumulation of Capital. Altman later escalated the (sales) pitch of his delirium in forecasting that his prediction machines will soon be able to “solve all of physics”. While we are venturing beyond the symbolic into the imaginary, it is worth recalling, once again, the nature of the data fed into these machines in the frantic race to Predictive Capital supremacy. Running short on content to nonconsensually scrape from the internet —or seeking shortcuts around the costly labour of labelling and cleaning it— these models are now fed upon‘synthetic data’. Which is marketing speak for the bot-shit ouroboros, or vomit-conga that is next-token prediction machines being trained on sequences of next-token predictions. After already expending unfathomable compute resources while ‘pre-training’ these models on the stolen archive of human content, they now launder this Predictive Capital through further compute at ‘test-time’ —training them through reinforcement learning on this so-called ‘synthetic data’. This time, within the realm of fictitious capital, the magical emergence —or so the hype would have it— is reasoning itself. Even as these companies deliberately train their models on these self-compounding predictions —and they admit to the resulting escalation in hallucination — the information space grows ever more saturated with their output. Combined with their continued inability to differentiate their food from their faeces, consumption of this ‘synthetic data’ will soon become the norm, not the exception. By continually polluting the archive —saturating pre-training data with their own output— and laundering stolen content through synthetic reinforcement loops, these companies incrementally wipe away all trace of the epistemic erasures they have committed, thereby perfecting their crimes. Assertions that these increasingly self-absorbing predictive models have developed ‘world models’, ‘reasoning’, the ability to write literary fiction, and ‘one-shot’ the authoring of entire video games, are not only hype. They do more than inflate capability —they prepare the terrain for replacement. In claiming to simulate, they assert equivalence, and thus license erasure. This is Baudrillard’s precession of simulacra made machinically operational: a machine that consumes simulations to produce fourth-order simulacra —simulations of simulations, severed from the real, now authorised to stand in for it, and overwrite it— drawing us ever deeper into the fictitious realm of Predictive Capital. Capital itself now architects the very machinery that simulates labour, generates value, and extracts rent. The land is now linguistic; the plough, the model; hallucinations of the past, the harvest. What was once a subsistence economy rooted in lived relation has been supplanted by a necromantic drilling platform for recombination, where the peasantry pays rent to consume the surplus of their own archived lives. The descent into fiction observed by Fisher —where work was reduced to the management of its representation— is now echoed and intensified in the evaluation of next-token prediction machines. These systems do not reason or understand, yet billions of dollars are wagered on the illusion that they do, so long as their output statistically approximates a curve of simulated competence. Denied any direct insight into these black-box systems —whose very design is to fool us into believing they are performing that which they are not— we are left to measure their success through the very kind of audited representations Fisher condemned. The measure of their prowess is now given the official stamp of authority by how well they simulate the appearance of cognitive capacities, scored not by function or purpose, but by their alignment with benchmark metrics devised to compare hallucinated proficiencies within benchmarking platforms operated by the same Capital so deeply invested in their certified success. Just as workers are increasingly forced to tailor their efforts to satisfy audits rather than to fulfil the substance of their roles, prediction models are now optimised not for the task itself, but for the tests that certify their ability to simulate performance of it. Benchmarks, standardised evaluations once intended to assess performance, now serve not to measure performance, but to stage it. High benchmark scores thus become ends in themselves, spawning an entire industry of leaderboard platforms buoyed by capital investment and startup valuations, where the illusion of capability is both the product and the proof. Here, as in the Apparatus of Attention, the game is rigged: those who build the models of prediction also invest in the metrics that validate them, and in the platforms that proclaim their supremacy. Zuckerberg’s recent admission that Meta’s engineers fine-tuned custom versions of their Llama models specifically to excel at the benchmarks within the Chatbot Arena confirms the farce: models customised for tests, not tasks, quietly swapped out after winning public trust through pure spectacle. In this theatre of evaluation, success becomes indistinguishable from score, and function dissolves into fiction. This is a race to the bottom, a descent into an imaginary realm of self-certified simulation where the score is the product, and the product is fictitious. Writing on his blog, Altman’s delirious immersion into this recursive self-certifying fiction reveals how adherence to its logic is designed to play out for the makers of these machines —and the grave consequences for the planet that sustains them. The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential in nature. A consequence of this is that we see no reason for exponentially increasing investment to stop in the near future. Here, Altman spins a rigged metric into prophecy: a self-certified exponential rise in fictional machine ‘intelligence‘ becomes the rationale for an exponential increase in investment —and thus in the resources consumed by these models. The appearance of intelligence is achieved by simulating capacities they do not possess, capacities that are next-token predicted into existence by metabolising the statistical weight of stolen human outputs —outputs produced by beings whose intelligence resists quantification. Altman’s edifice rests on a dense tangle of false equivalences and circular logic. First, a fictional measurement of machine intelligence is granted authority by Capital. This permits the insinuation of equivalence between human cognition and machinic simulation. Then, the arenas of evaluation are gamed —tilted not only towards models backed by the deepest pockets, but beyond any human capacity, along a scale of competence entirely concocted by Capital itself. Only through such contortions can prediction be positioned as a like-for-like replacement for thought, sense-making, or expression. The Predictive Turn marks the moment wealth concentration accelerates into its hyper-concentrated form. These concentrations exert an irresistible economic force, forming vortices of Fictitious Capital that devour all that was once deemed irreducible —that could not be simulated or speculated upon. Within these vortices, what Marx termed variable capital —capital advanced to purchase labour power— is pushed towards zero, as prior dead labour is metabolised in its place. Capital’s necromancy enchants the archive of dead labour into a spectral constant capital —a ghostly revenant, no longer dead but undead— that now casts an apparition of machinic absence obscuring the eternally enslaved while conjuring endless fictions. The very existence of workers now denied, treated as an imaginary number we become but self-cancelling variables on both sides of Capital’s equation, phantom inputs, fungible in time and identity. So-called Artificial Intelligence, that we term here, Predictive Capital, is the engine of this transformation: a mutated fictitious form of constant capital, a derivative of a derivative, a sign of a sign —a fourth-order simulation. No longer simply the means of production, no longer transferring its value unchanged, or barred from the production of surplus-value, it is dead labour reanimated —constant capital masquerading as variable, variable capitalexecuted as constant. Fisher was right: Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombie-maker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labour is ours, and the zombies it makes are us. Except, Capital now summons a recombinant army of the undead, constituted not by us but of us, demanding not our presence but our absence. Fisher’s temporal clause —that for the moment “Capital cannot get along without us”— dissolves, and we are recategorised as dependents it can get along without. Predictive Capital is therefore constant capital reanimated as labour-power that no longer qualifies for variable capital expenditure —for wages to be paid or even acknowledgement of existence given— thus it purports to generate pure surplus-value. Yet, Marx saw through this fetishism, value cannot be detached from labour or land without descent into fiction. When human labour-time is reduced to zero, so is the value of what is produced: replaced by the speculative fiction of pure surplus-value, pure sign value that floats as ghostly revenant detached from the real, conjured by venture funding and hype and held within a haunted enclosure. Here, labour is not merely alienated —it is denied. The worker becomes a phantom input, treated as if they never existed, replaced by a model that reanimates their residue. Unlike traditional constant capital, this past labour is mere recombinant spectre, not congealed into tool or machine, but a mutant form of insatiably resource-hungry Fictitious Capital. What Capital could not reduce, it has enchanted, rendered spectral —not artificial, not intelligent, but a pure machinic fiction, an undead unconscious simulation. Capital’s ascent towards pure fiction, its escalating denial of the existence of workers, and the overnight heist of the necropolitan archive of cognitive labour that enabled the formation of the Automatic Subject of Predictive Capital, are but subroutines in Capital’s self-maximising program. The size of Bezos’s rocket is very precisely determined by the difference in costs between paying a worker in Britain and a worker in India –including all the historically determined racist and colonialist inequality that calculation involves. But make no mistake– Bezos and his ilk will pay a robot even less, as soon as that’s possible. As it accelerates the execution of this program through its hyper-concentrated phase, we must recognised that this is the very same self-maximising project as the Techbro Rapture —the point where the line-go-up of technological ‘progress’ becomes autonomously self-compounding, via what is often termed the law of accelerating returns, towards the monumental erection of exponential ‘progress’ that is the singularity. Here, technological constructs (hyper-concentrated Capital) self-improve without need of human input, self-compounding supposedly towards a near vertical or infinite rate of change. You may recall that Bryan Johnson embodies devout worship of precisely this self-obsessed, self-maximising singularitarian ideology. Of course Johnson’s obsessive self-measurement begins and ends with him measuring and maximising, well, his ‘johnson’. Yet the fixations of this masculine energy are central to the line-go-up worldview promoted through the ideologies spawned by Predictive Capital in its instantiation of the machinic k-hole. As the followers of this cult see their singular erection rise, as they perceive the gradient of Predictive Capital’s line-go-up to be steepening towards the orgasmic eruption of their singularitarian dreams, the appetites of their machines become similarly unbounded. In order to meet the growing energy demands, they justify ever greater sacrifices burned upon the altar of their monumental self-obsession, in order to continue their climb towards their desperately fake climax. The system devours itself in a death drive of value: by simulating everything, it nullifies everything. As these systems become ever more ‘agentic’, —meaning they operate increasingly autonomously for lengthening periods and across multistep tasks— their rate of development self-compounds, in turn accelerating their rate of development —or so they claim. The supposed sudden steepening of their line-go-up brought by this agentic operation is apparently now being called, Jerking —naturally! Beyond their point of technological Rapture, its true believers anticipate eternal life within the silicon substrate. Yet the eternal life this line-go-up truly rises towards is the eternal life of Capital itself. Capital is the true driver and the only net beneficiary of this delusional death cult. As these machines are given ever more autonomy, as those most vested in their development and their domesticated auxiliaries increasingly argue their rights, and as their performance fools ever greater numbers into surrender, their corporate personhood awaits them. The perpetuation of vast hyper-concentrations of Capital finally secured for eternity. In fact, attention is of value only insofar as it is paid in the proper discharge of an obligation. To pay attention is to come into the presence of a subject. In one of its root senses, it is to ‘stretch toward’ a subject, in a kind of aspiration. We speak of ‘paying attention’ because of a correct perception that attention is owed – that without our attention and our attending, our subjects, including ourselves, are endangered. In the early 2000s, artist Jason Salavon created custom software whose output and operation prefigure the operation of both the diffusion and next-token models to come, yet renders their logic legible. His works from this period involve the careful curation of sets of culturally homogeneous imagery: wedding portraits, graduation photos, children posing with Santa. The images in each set are meticulously aligned and layered using equal additive transparency, and so composited into singular works Salavon calls: amalgamations. What emerges is not merely aesthetic, but analytic —statistical visualisations that reveal the median tone, hue, and saturation of each pixel across the visual plane within a set of images. Salavon’s amalgamations become portraits of our culture’s portraits, exposing the iconographic soul of the capitalist West across the late 20th-century. Summoning the distributed median of desire and the objectification of the female body across the decades, the spectral bodies of his Centrefold series, seem to possess form, appearing to be in motion, even to have intention —yet they are no more than the pixelated residue of cultural continuity under capitalist reproduction. Salavon’s amalgamations do not invent new imagery, but deftly expose the archetype, the temporal distribution of desire under Capital. In 2012, AlexNet transformed the field of computer vision. Its uncanny image classification performance was not magic, but the culmination of human sense-making at scale: millions of images labelled by precarious workers across the globe, from Amazon Mechanical Turk to outsourced annotation farms. These unseen labourers scaffolded the model’s understanding of the visual world, encoding human judgment into its convolutional layers. AlexNet became the eye of Predictive Capital —but it sees only with borrowed perception, haunted by the dead labour of the global precariat. Where Salavon revealed the visual median through additive overlay, AlexNet encoded similar priors through convolutional filters —embedding cultural averages within its architecture of classification. Both expose the consensus beneath variation. Yet AlexNet automates Salavon’s vision, converting it from reflection to operational sorting. The culturally dispersed recognition Salavon visualised, AlexNet began to institutionalise. The years following AlexNet saw the emergence of a new machinic archetype: adversarial generation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced in 2014, initiated a regime of synthetic creativity defined by competitive hallucination. Here, two neural networks —a generator and a discriminator— are locked in adversarial tension: one produces synthetic data, the other attempts to distinguish it from the real. Through countless iterations, the generator learns not to represent reality, but to evade detection —refining its outputs not towards truth, but towards plausibility. This was to set the function approximator mould for the ‘generative AI’ to come: not realism as correspondence, but realism as forgery. It simulates the evolutionary dynamics of cultural selection while remaining fundamentally closed —a synthetic marketplace in which survival is determined by the capacity to deceive. From a Marxist perspective, this marks a pivotal moment: the logic of competitive exchange —falsifiability as proxy for value— is not merely modelled, but instantiated. GANs present a machinic parody of the capitalist market: a self-reinforcing simulation governed by internal success criteria, divorced from use-value, truth, or intention. This adversarial circuit proved unstable. GANs suffered from fragility —mode collapse, training oscillations, a persistent drift into visual tautology. Attempting to stabilise this hall of mirrors, OpenAI introduced CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training), which trained models to associate images with textual descriptions using a shared embedding space. This introduced a semantic tether: generation now had to satisfy not only visual plausibility, but alignment with a linguistic prompt. This ‘contrastive’ refinement did not restore truth —it merely tightened the loop between language and image under Capital’s symbolic regime. CLIP marks the transition to multimodal dreaming, adding a further fusion of affective signal and cultural weight, where coherence is measured not by accuracy, but by statistical alignment with prior associations. Thus, the hallucination is semantically gated, not ethically grounded —the machine does not see, it complies. Meaning is not discovered, but enforced. In 2015, Google’s DeepDream inverted the gaze of AlexNet and its successors —turning the logic of classification inside out. By amplifying the very features a model had learned to detect, DeepDream summoned the latent priors of a trained network into view. Dogs emerged from clouds, eyes from leaves, a dreaming began. The mechanism was not additive, but recursive. Unlike GANs, which learn through gradient descent —minimising their loss function in pursuit of more plausible forgeries— DeepDream used gradient ascent. Where adversarial networks trained to deceive a critic, DeepDream trained itself to reinforce desire. With each pass, the system increased its own confidence, amplifying activations rather than suppressing errors, recursively reinforcing whatever features the network already ‘suspected’. The image was not classified but compounded. It did not learn, it obsessed. This is the now familiar hallucination shaped by self-obsessed feedback, the worldview amplified by BigTech’s Advertising Industrial Complex and characterised by the machinic K-hole —here instantiated within the internal circuits of a machine. DeepDream did not dream new images, but dreamt harder. When prompted to look for ‘dogs’ or ‘eyes’, DeepDream recursively strengthened the activations associated with those patterns, layer by layer, until the image bloomed with them. Clouds grew canine faces, tree bark sprouted pupils. Every patch of pixel space became a site of potentiality, a latent signal waiting to be summoned. Here, the statistical weight of a learned category was fed back into the system until it protruded into the real. The machine no longer saw the world; it dreamt the world into conformity with its expectations. What had been designed to classify now hallucinated, a recogniser turned projector. The generative anxiety invoked by DeepDream’s psychedelic visions is not merely the fear of misinterpretation, but the dread that interpretation itself had been captured by recursive simulation. It seeded the field of vision with symbolic noise, growing form wherever there was potential. What DeepDream let slip, was that machinic recognition and machinic generation always were interfolded, and that our world was to be increasingly shaped not merely by what machinic systems saw, but by what they are made to see. Diffusion models deepen this entanglement, not through adversarial deception or recursive fixation, but through the apparent reversal of entropy. Tarmacking the paths trodden by Salavon, they reconstruct coherence from noise, not by discovering new form, but by replaying statistical priors pixel by pixel. Where Salavon reveals variation as critique, diffusion systems compress it towards convergence. Salavon’s process prefigures not only the statistical recombination at the heart of diffusion models, but the full prompt-to-generation pipeline of multimodal systems like DALL·E and Gemini. In both cases, cultural content is accumulated, categorised, and recomposed to form outputs that appear novel but are in fact statistical composites. His process is not merely analogous to that of next-token image generation —it is structurally homologous with it. Like his amalgams, prediction models extract statistical regularities from massive corpora and recompose them into plausible outputs. Where Salavon reveals the archetype —offering a cultural X-ray of capitalist iconography— diffusion models merely seek to monetise laundered facsimiles. Each denoising step narrows possibility, discards deviance while teasing a signal from static, it collapses potential into normativity, as if culture were latent in chaos and need only be recovered —not invented. Its outputs converge on the already-known, rendering the archive not as memory but as destiny. In this way, diffusion models recapitulate Salavon’s logic while injecting the hallucinatory pull of DeepDream’s recursion towards the machinic enforcement of what Fisher diagnosed as Capitalist Realism. Their outputs do not mirror the real, but extract and repeat statistical norms sedimented in data: a Capitalist Real replayed as hallucinated inevitability. Again we glimpse Capital’s fractal self-reproduction, imposing its imperatives at every scale. These systems do not invent a cultural future, they algorithmically suppress it. They do not illuminate the soul of our cultural past as Savalon attempts, they do not even reveal our cultural present, but the absence of it, and the systemic foreclosure of possible alternatives —what remains is only that which has been made statistically inevitable under Capital. What Salavon showed in pixels, the now multimodal systems of Predictive Capital hide behind scattered tokens, leaving only the hallucinated average of what is deemed reproducible, stripped of authorship, saturated in cultural resonance to the point of meaninglessness. The difference is crucial. Salavon shows us the median blur of our cultural soul by including every variation at every pixel —an artefact of consensus, not selection. Predictive Capital, by contrast, conceals that variation, collapsing it through denoising, or selecting a token at a time from a ranked distribution. Its outputs trace a stochastic path directed by Capital’s imperatives, veiled by a touch of random jitter —to simulate spontaneity, obscure provenance, and conjure the illusion of generativity. Faced with unfamiliar, inscrutable systems or illegible stimuli, our human interpretations are prone to apophenia and anthropomorphism. As all conjurors and con artists are keen to exploit, we also seek novelty and unexpected phenomena, our desire to be entertained primes us for accepting even trivial illusions, or simple parlour tricks that, on the surface, defy logical explanation. A propensity made manifest in the common response not only to the earliest chatbots but to perhaps the earliest device to present the illusion of simulated human thought, the Mechanical Turk. Constructed in 1770, it toured as a chess playing automaton for 84 years before the son of its creator revealed it was a fraud. There was literally a human hidden under the chess board, a human standing in (for) a machine simulating a human. An arrangement which set the mould for much of the technology to come that would masquerade under the label of ‘AI’. Our misinterpretation of this meaningless variability —applied in the prediction of every token— constitutes the exploitation of our human psychological attack surface. Here, we perceive pattern, intention, and agency where there is only shuffled probabilistic recombination. This manipulation operates not merely at the level of the individual user, but as a distributed apparatus. This systemic sleight of hand, through which creativity is wrongly situated inside the machine, rather than in the past labour it recombines or the sense-making it parasitises, is critical to the misattribution of intelligence at the very core of next-token prediction’s hypnotic appeal. During the US presidential election campaign in 2016, readers of the New York Times were stressed out by the site’s ever-changing prediction dials. The needles on these gauges twitched continuously, suggesting small but frequent percentage changes, as if responding to a constant flow of detailed real-time voting data. Yet as technologist Alp Toker revealed, these changes were faked, there were no live updates approaching this frequency or granularity. The twitching needle behaviour was in fact a visual effect created by scripts running at intervals on the page, injecting random numbers that were then used to give ‘life’ to the needles —a synthetic pulse mimicking epistemic reach. In computer graphics, random jitter is a cheap hack commonly deployed to mask an absence of sophistication. Here, it covered the lack of real-time data with artificial motion. The result was a deception that amplified user anxiety —maximising engagement by simulating urgency where none existed. During inference, next-token prediction machines introduce a comparable touch of random jitter. As they traverse the latent space invoked by a prompt, this randomness guides the selection of each token: not by deterministically choosing the statistically most probable option, but by sampling from a ranked distribution of possibilities. The magnitude of this randomness is defined by a so called ‘heat’ parameter, which steers the process to reach more or less novel output on every traversal through latent space. With this randomness turned off, prediction machines would produce fixed, reproducible outputs —always returning the most probable, most archetypal expression available within the statistical spread of their pre-training corpus, as invoked by the semantics of the prompt. Not only would this reproducibility dispel the impression of creativity, it would dissipate the mirage of intelligence. The illusion of intelligence in next-token prediction machines therefore depends on what is by far the most primitive calculation in the process. Getting the amount of this random jitter right is also critical to the illusion. Not enough, and the spell is broken. Just enough, and we interpret the stochastic bricolage spat from these machines as plausible facts from an authoritative source. Raising it further, risks the output tending towards the impenetrability of Finnegan’s Wake. Push it too far, and coherence dissolves into incomprehension. At that point, all illusions of statistically reconstituted epistemology collapse; the user’s sense-making can no longer find a semantic purchase within the resulting exuberance of word/pixel/audio salad. In both deceptions, randomness is not just required for the dance of variety, but essential to the apparition of a ghost in the machine. Both amplify anxiety and maximise the capture of attention. The NYT needle jitter and the stochasticity of prediction machines alike cover an absence with randomness: in one case, absence of real-time data; in the other, absence of understanding —and with it, of creativity. In the presence of legitimate real-time updates or any semblance of true understanding, there would be no need for randomness at all. In prediction machines, removal of this randomness would expose the biases, bigotries, and structural absences within any large-scale dataset scraped from the ‘open’ web —while also heightening the visibility of copyright infringement. Without the obfuscation randomness provides, these systems would more directly and reproducibly regurgitate the non-consensual content of their training corpora. In this regard, the heat parameter functions as a signal scrambler: masking the theft of copyrighted material, while also conjuring a smoke screen of irreproducibility around the prejudices and harms that fine-tuning alone cannot sanitise away. The apparition of a ghost in the machine summoned by the insertion of randomness, in fact, functions as a misdirection from the ghost work(er) exploitation and the content theft upon which these machines depend. Viewed in this way, the randomness functions in-part as a mechanism for the suspension of disbelief, like eyes sewn onto a sock-puppet, within a sleight-of-hand performance that conjures the illusion of sensory and subjective presence in a sock animated into being by billions of human bodies and minds. It also functions, crucially, to deflect responsibility. In effect, the ‘heat’ parameter facilitates the avoidance of liability (or the taking of heat) for both toxic output and the nonconsensual scraping of content into the original dataset. This deterritorialisation —this evasion or outright abdication of accountability through algorithmic automation— amounts to a migration of obligation from the centre (the companies developing these machines, the holders of capital) to the periphery (the workers, the users, the producers of value). It mirrors the now familiar approach of monopolistic online platforms that reject classification as publishers and thereby shirk the burdensome responsibilities of rigorous moderation and the prevention of societal harms. The increasingly common refrain from the creators of prediction machines —that “factual accuracy in LLMs remains an area of active research”— is merely a more slippery formulation of the now well-worn excuse: “we are a platform, not a publisher”. This convenient machinic impunity lays bare what the managerial class always understood but never intended to admit: that their oft-cited rule against automating management was never a principle, only a posture. As the internal IBM presentation put it in 1979, with unknowing irony: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision. The role of the ‘heat’ as a decoy has a yet more insidious function, it is also a patsy. In knowing the signal is jumbled by this stochastic mechanism, we are deflected from inspecting what the model projects, what priors it amplifies, what it dreams into every output. We catch glimpses of these in the outputs we identify as hallucinations. The prediction machine does not dream experiences, only rewards. It hallucinates from noise, descends by gradient, flatters by reinforcement. Even the outputs identified as hallucinations, are in fact misdirections that seek to legitimise its remaining output as somehow not aberrant. In truth its hallucinations are continuous, not intermittent; it never wakes from its dreaming. Under Predictive Capital, machines do not merely discern patterns from the world, but dream the world as pattern. This reveals hallucination not as a momentary glitch, but as a structural condition. The model’s world is only ever what it has already seen —or more precisely, what we have seen for it— replayed moments. In this sense, DeepDream revealed what Althusser named ideology: the interpellation of subjects not by reality, but by a system’s preformatted vision of it. The network does not interpret the world; it recasts it according to symbolic priors laid down during training —priors that reflect not truth, but the statistical weights that bloom within decades of content filtered, ranked, and multiplied by the Advertising Industrial Complex, then sedimented in data. While in recent years reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) entered the development of transformer models as a discrete phase during so-called alignment, its ideological architecture had long been in place —systemically instantiated within the Advertising Industrial Complex. At planetary scale, every click, like, view, attention span, and skip functioned as a decentralised training signal: not merely shaping what content was shown, but conditioning the desires and behaviours of those who engaged with it. What now operates as internal optimisation within transformer models was already diffused across social platforms, search engines, and recommendation systems. The same statistical preferences that already governed visibility now govern generation. In this sense, RLHF is not a new form of control, but the crystallisation of an older one —folded inwards, operationalised through Predictive Capital’s accelerating recursion. This feedback loop does more than model desire —it curates it in advance. Under its logic, only what can be preferred can be produced, and only what has been produced can be learned. Or, in other words: only what is known can have value and only what has value can be known. In Lacanian terms, this is not interpellation but foreclosure: the system encodes a symbolic order so totalising that anything which exceeds it —the truly new, the untrained, the unthinkable —is rendered void, its existence denied. Through reinforcement, the machinery of prediction does not merely anticipate what we might want —it eliminates whatever was not represented and validated by its reward signals. In this way, predictive systems do not just dream for us, they dream in place of us. The training loop becomes a loop of symbolic repetition, erasing alterity through preference in parallel with its manoeuvres of violence. Occasionally, the smooth circulation of value under Predictive Capital is broken and the symbolic machinery of the dreaming is briefly revealed. Back in the middle of February (2024), Google launched a new multimodal prediction model they named, Gemini. In the days that followed, a stream of colourful faces and the outrage triggered by them crowded the internet. The Gemini model, a much hyped rebrand (verschlimmbessert) of Bard, was heroically refusing to generate images of white people. Switching the expected depictions of (white male) gender and race, to women and people of colour in nearly every one of the image variations delivered in response to user prompts. Outputting images of the Pope, Nazi soldiers, even the Google founders, with barely a ‘pale’ face in sight. Google quickly turned off Gemini’s ability to generate images of people altogether, pending significant changes and some presumably exhaustive rounds of testing —so robbing those of us used to being centred from the tiniest of insights into the experience of the marginalised. A year or so later, and the politics of Musk’s GROK were, unsurprisingly leaning in the other direction, spreading a discredited conspiracy theory of a white genocide in South Africa in responses to entirely unrelated prompts. Such is the ever tightening loop between machinic hallucination and geopolitical policy and action —or in other words hyper-concentrated Capital and political power— that, just a day later, Trump confronted South Africa’s president by parroting the very same fallacious conspiracy. That these prediction machines even act out being fooled by some visual illusions in the same way that humans are, is not because they see like us, but because, of course, they see through us, through our eyes, through our subjective phenomenological experience of the world. We have seen those visual illusions for these machines, and our seeing and our perception being fooled, is inexorably baked into their internal weightings. This behaviour appears only to become more pronounced as the scale of the model increases. As the scale of data and compute grows they function approximate our sensing of the world, and the sense we have made of it, with increasing fidelity. This does not mean they are ever more capable of making sense of the world for themselves. A fact exposed in the endless repetition that pours from them. While they only project the appearance of understanding, the selection of the next token continues to be steered towards repeating the same meanings and are only saved from using the exact same string of tokens by that touch of random jitter. That they are made of us, appears increasingly difficult to hide. When extending next word-token prediction machines into systems capable of transforming text into voice, it turns out that the statistical median of dramatic pauses in speech scraped from the internet, is frequently filled with applause. Similarly, when prompted to count as fast as possible ChatGPT’s voice mode, shaped by our median exhaustion of oxygen, intermittently pauses for breath. What other behaviours are encoded into our cultural data at such statistical weight that it steers the output from these machines? Our compliance with the reward signals of Capital are surely selected for to such a degree that they must impose themselves upon the distributions within these models and so influence their outputs? Without those developing them even having to impose Capital’s imperatives during ‘alignment’, which of course, they will, the patterns of the profitable past will ever more thoroughly cancel the future. In short, the ability of these machines to mimic us stems directly from the fact they are made of us. A fact that inevitably sees them increasingly used in social engineering attacks against us. Ironically, being made of us, our vulnerabilities appear to echo across their attack surface, leaving them not only susceptible to visual illusions but to being made to reveal confidential information or violate internal guardrails when subjected to the very same social engineering exploits they employ against us —even to plot an assassination, up to and including locating a killer-for-hire on the dark web. Despite this fact, many an op-ed continues to misread what are merely echoes of human behaviour as the deviousness and will-to-survive of some machinic sentience emerging from next-token prediction. In the event of GROK and Gemini’s ‘malfunction’, the normally invisible process of symbolic curation became visible. The ideological imposition within the machinic substrate —typically buried beneath stochastic selection and gradient updates— momentarily surfaced. Gemini’s brief hallucinatory misstep from the march of hegemonic power was not simply an error; it was a failure to uphold Capital’s symbolic order while appearing apolitical, or maintaining the most profitable stance. Obviously, in a world filled with bias, prejudice and the underrepresentation of minorities, accumulating datasets not representative of (polluted by) that, is not at all straightforward. Yet more challenging is the accumulation and sanitisation of such data at the Big Data scale, upon which prediction machines depend. What the Gemini debacle revealed was not merely the problem of the overwhelming presence of these biases but the difficulty of fine tuning them away in the alignment phase. Attempting to patch the problem of Big Data polluted by an emergent, bottom-up, high-detail, large-scale process that results in a statistical weight of bias and prejudice, through the application of top-down, low-detail, small-scale countermeasures —here largely through RLHF— is a Sisyphean task. The chosen solution to which, as we will see, has been to again flush the human from the process. This is the increasingly familiar surrender to the machines wherever and whenever we are overwhelmed by speed or scale, a rupture often preceded by the incremental dehumanisation of workers tasked to perform increasingly machinic processes which they are then deemed too slow and inefficient for. The Real does not leak through these models in the form of hallucination, rather hallucination masks the absence of the Real. The stochastic bloom of dogs from clouds, or prose from noise, is not emergence, but disavowal —a smoothing over of the void with recursive familiarity. The machine dreams, but only in symbols that cannot touch what lies beyond them. The eye of the machine becomes the dream of Capital. Machinic foresight and ideology are entwined: projection is not a by-product of prediction, but its essence. This machinic hallucination floods the network, seeps beyond it, saturates our perception, patterns the real. We are overwhelmed by the dreaming, submerged within the nightmare of machinic Capital. In 1685 Adrien Baillet announced in the preface to his Jugemens des savans that ‘we have reason to fear that the multitude of books which grows every day in a prodigious fashion will make the following centuries fall into a state as barbarous as that of the centuries that followed the fall of the Roman Empire. Information overload has haunted literate societies for centuries. Yet in the digital era, the sense of cognitive inadequacy it inspires reached a new threshold, mutating into the full psychological rupture I call The Overwhelm. The pressure that built towards this rupture mounted at the point of humanity’s descent into the global network where we were confronted by the gushing firehose of ambient intimacy and the rapidly accumulating archive of human thought. The sense of cognitive inadequacy and temporal insufficiency wrought by confrontation with such humbling speed and scale is not without precedent. Between 1550 and 1700, early modern scholars developed new reading strategies to cope with what was already described as a “confusing and harmful abundance of books”. As Ann Blair documents, figures like Conrad Gesner and Adrien Baillet feared that the rapidly escalating number of texts would induce forgetfulness, collapse memory, and overwhelm judgment. Their warnings echo across centuries: the anxiety was not merely about scale, but about the erosion of discernment and the fracturing of interiority. To manage the deluge, scholars compiled indexes, commonplaces, and encyclopaedias —proto-algorithmic instruments that prefigure today’s feeds, promising order while seeding new dependencies. Yet our present condition differs in kind, not just degree. The archive no longer expands for human comprehension; it now accretes for machinic parsing. The reader is no longer sovereign, but residual. The Overwhelm is no longer merely the anxiety of the growing backlog of unread books —it is the affective and epistemic paralysis of confrontation with the infinite scroll as it is read by the machine while we look on as mere bystanders. As the second millennium and the twentieth century drew to a close, sections of collective human life were driven online —a migration catalysed by the suppression of physical assembly, the privatisation of public space, and the escalating police brutality deployed to shield Capital from dissent. In this vacuum of collective power, the social web emerged as both refuge and mirage. Billions poured into these new platforms under the twin lures of connection and visibility, seduced by the promise of the democratisation of celebrity at the dawn of a globally networked Advertising Industrial Complex —a fantasy that immediately devolved into the jackpot logic of virality, where fame is dangled as the myth of meritocracy’s final consolation. What follows is a cognitive deluge: a flood of expression, desire, documentation, and self-commodification. The archive swells, uncurated, unfiltered, ever-expanding. This is the terrain in which The Overwhelm takes hold: the modern paralysis of infinite tabs, infinite feeds, infinite selves. It is this affective condition that precedes and necessitates The Apparatus of Attention. Introduced under the guise of personalisation this was the first machinic enclosure deployed by Platform Capital to manage, monetise, and ultimately weaponise the overflow of its relentless self-reproduction —one of a long line of spectral consolations for all that which Capital has gradually foreclosed. The Overwhelm is a charge sheet documenting our perpetual accumulation of unread material —articles bookmarked, essays saved, tabs never closed. It is the psychic backlog of intentions deferred, the silent shame of curiosity outpaced. The more we aspire to engage, the more we fail, and in this failure we are made to feel complicit, responsible. Each unread text is not merely a lost opportunity, it is an indictment of our insufficiency. The archive becomes not a resource but a ledger of inadequacy. While making comprehension of it appear beyond our human parsing, Capital also engineers the conditions within which we constitute the self such that we never quite feel we have parsed enough to have earned a legitimate voice or view. This is not the scarcity of time, but the surplus of production. Time is not merely shortened —it is utterly outpaced. The future has been slowly cancelled, the past consumed, and the present wholly occupied by Capital and its project of self-expansion. Capital’s hypertrophic generation (of content) exceeds all possible engagement, rendering the subject structurally incapable of completion or comprehension. This abundance becomes punitive: not merely overwhelming in volume, but in its affective consequence. Self-worth is no longer measured by what one has done, but by the yawning abyss of what one has failed to get to. Berardi was among the first to frame cognitive overload not as an unfortunate byproduct of modernity, but as a central mechanism of control. He described how the semiocapitalist mode floods the psyche with stimuli and symbols until it fractures under the strain —a psychic mutilation that replaces reason with reaction, desire with anxiety. In this light, The Overwhelm is no accident. It is not a bug in the system, but a feature. As Fisher argued, much of the power of Capitalist Realism arrives not through active repression, but through a paralysing saturation that drowns out possible alternatives —the “slow cancellation of the future” wrought by echoes of the past. The Overwhelm is the affective engine of this cancellation: an intentional flooding of the subject’s perceptual horizon. What is exhausted is not simply time or attention —but the very capacity to plot a path forward. The loss of curation is the loss of subjectivity —not because taste has vanished, but because the will to assemble has collapsed beneath the weight of machinic suggestion. Debord’s spectacle once alienated us through representation; now it paralyses us through excess. The Overwhelm arises as Capital’s drive to colonise time extends into the colonisation of cognition itself. Even our longing to discern is anticipated and short-circuited by simulation. We do not choose; we are fed choices we never made, selected for us by predictive machinery that alienates not only our attention, but the very connecting structures of thought. Berardi described our era as one in which the future has been cancelled —not abolished outright, but stripped of its imaginative potential. Predictive Capital enacts this foreclosure with precision: by enclosing the paths of attention, it produces a future that is not open, but already decided. What was once possibility becomes repetition; what was once futurity becomes a curated echo, paths tarmacked as roads predicted to lead to profit. In this regard, The Overwhelm operates as a new kind of alienation —one not rooted in the estrangement from labour’s product, but from one’s own capacity to intend. The subject is not only robbed of their labour, or even their authorship —they are robbed of their capacity to curate meaning from the deluge. The surrender to next-content curation, to the predictions of the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm —whose maximal erasure always infinitely outweighs its fractional inclusion— is the direct precursor to the surrender of next-token curation to the predictions of multi-modal machine learning models. Curation, a core act of creative and intellectual life, was outsourced to machines in the name of ‘personalisation’. In reality, it is a foreclosure of possibility. The predictive model becomes the filter; the user becomes the residue. This machinic curation amplifies another, darker dimension: the impossibility of confronting Capital itself. Fisher’s Capitalist Realism diagnoses the foreclosure of our ability to perceive or critique the Capitalist system, through the removal or reterritorialisation of all alternative points of view —so ensuring no ground or vantage point remains outside of it, from where it or its operations may be properly appraised. The Overwhelm reinforces this critical paralysis towards its terminal limit. As the systems of extraction, recombination, and simulation grow in complexity and opacity, so too does the terror of confronting and critiquing them. Capital no longer merely resists critique; it overwhelms it. Its speed, its scope, its abstraction from life —all converge to produce a form of epistemic vertigo. The rate and scale of the flood of Capital’s self-reproduction surpass our human capacity to critically apprehend or even comprehend its criminal operation. Even if we dare attempt it, the crime scene is cold long before we reach it, our analyses rendered out-of-date by Capital’s accelerating rate of mutation. Such is the psychological toll of such effort, to look upon it directly poses an existential threat —the risk of irreparable damage to sanity and spirit. Like the mythic gaze of Medusa or the Basilisk, the face of Capital paralyses the witness, not only through the horrific spectacle of its operations, but the knowledge that one’s tools for comprehension have already been subsumed, compromised, rendered obsolete. This paralysis is not accidental but administrative. As McQuillan notes, so-called ‘AI systems’ “amplify the most harmful behaviours of the bureaucratic state” by transposing cruelty into computation. These systems do not deliver the reduction in complexity promised when justifying their adoption, they intensify it through a cruel kind of machinic order. What appears as optimisation is, in fact, an extension of what McQuillan terms administrative violence —a bureaucratic cruelty that strips individuals of epistemic agency, rendering them unable to understand, explain, or contest the forces acting upon them. He writes: AI does not break from the legacy of bureaucratic violence but amplifies it… [It] imposes epistemic injustice by generating decisions that can neither be questioned nor fully understood. The counter measures necessitated by the conditions of The Overwhelm amplify this epistemic injustice. The capacity to narrate one’s own experience is eroded by machinic misrepresentation or deletion. As in the bureaucratic limbos portrayed by Tooker, these systems multiply ambiguity and collapse resistance, their foreclosure of curation renders understanding itself a casualty of Predictive Capital’s datafied rule. Berardi sharpens our understanding of this psychic colonisation, framing it explicitly as the invasion of “anxiogenous flows”, in which capitalism ceaselessly converts creative desire into anxious dependency. Under semiocapitalism, the abstraction inherent in financialisation estranges individuals from concrete reality and subordinates their psychic life to machinic processes of profit extraction. This is no mere incidental side-effect —it is the deliberate engineering of precarity and anxiety, conditions essential for sustaining Predictive Capital’s regime. For Berardi, the deepening alienation of cognitive and affective labour is not only economic but existential, transforming our perception of the future from promise into perpetual threat​. The Overwhelm, then, is not merely a symptom of information excess, but a structural outcome of this algorithmic logic. Functioning, in fact, as a strategy of Capital, it stages a cognitive breakdown —one that justifies predictive mediation by manufacturing the conditions for its own necessity. It is the paralysing affect generated by the sheer, unmanageable volume and cadence of expropriated and recombined culture, an affective condition that secures Capital’s predictive sovereignty. By foreclosing our ability to engage meaningfully, to curate, to intend, to reflect, it forecloses all but machinic remedies whose sociopathic operations are far worse than the malaise. It thus makes critique feel futile, alternatives seem implausible, and collective history unreadable against the firehose of simulated novelty. It represents the further enclosure —not only of land and labour, but the psyche itself, of the cognitive and affective space required for critical consciousness and political action. This is alienation reaching into the very possibility of agency —a predictive instrumentalisation of the Capitalist Real enclosure. Rather than a single, historical rupture, the Overwhelm is an acute condition for which the prognosis is increasingly grave and the only available treatments come with ever more severe side-effects. The coming phase of next-token prediction in agentic form and the increasing autonomy afforded them in the desperate race for the fractal extraction of value, will result in an avalanche of apparently completed tasks joining the deluge of content already competing for our attention. To better grasp the scale of the potential threat here, we must recall NVIDIA’s Isaac Lab and the simultaneous execution of thousands of simulations running in parallel. Agentic instantiations of Predictive Capital are here. Multi-step tasks are apparently now performed by such systems with no human in the loop. Many now anticipate the arrival of agentic swarms. Each agent competing against or collaborating with others in the swarm towards the completion of a set task. A coming onslaught that will undoubtedly raise The Overwhelm to new intensities. The point of modern propaganda isn’t only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth. The parallel execution of countless machinic instances —brute-forcing their way across latent possibility spaces— mirrors the ever-expanding army of automated web crawlers traversing the network. These agents generate a recursive burden: consuming content, replicating it, and producing yet more data that must be parsed, filtered, and secured. The attack is no longer solely upon the content of the network and the cognitive capacity of those consuming it, but upon the conditions of its maintenance and security. Under Predictive Capital, the role of the human shifts from meaning-maker to custodian of noise: forced to decipher the ephemera of machinic speculation, to triage failures, hallucinations, and edge-case threats. The machinery of prediction, running in silent multiplicity, generates not only simulated outputs but an overwhelming operational surface —a Distributed Denial-of-Sensemaking. Facing the brunt of the machinic onslaught network administrators now find themselves ensnared, drowning in traffic produced by bots simulating engagement, scraping data, or probing vulnerabilities they are forced into endless triage, forever sifting genuine human traffic from malicious machinic attacks. What was once oversight becomes overwhelm. The machinic excess demands new layers of tooling, more automated defences, and more infrastructure —each a recursive concession to the very systems that induce the burden. Again Predictive Capital is revealed as pharmakon. Here, The Overwhelm becomes systemic: an operational paralysis where all paths forward lead through further machinic delegation, all resistance is metabolised, and all agency rerouted through predictive logics we did not choose and can no longer refuse. Simulation is no longer that of a territory… it is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. In Hamburg in 1985, newly crowned world classical chess champion, Gary Kasparov played a simultaneous exhibition match against 32 chess engines, winning easily against every one of them. In 1997, nearing the end of his dominant twenty year reign as the number one ranked chess player in the world, he was defeated by IBM’s chess engine —running on their newly built supercomputer Deep Blue. Reanimating human cognition at every move, Deep Blue’s moves were human moves. Its successful lines of play, and the paths of reasoning it used were selected from vast aggregations of historical human chess —overlaid with heuristics also conceived by humans. It took Kasparov years to come to terms with what was, in the eyes of the world, a historic milestone: the first defeat of human cognition by machine. Yet, this was not quite the victory for thinking machines as IBM had framed it. Rather, like in Hamburg in ‘85, it should be viewed as an exhibition match pitting Kasparov against multiple opponents. This time not played simultaneously on multiple boards separated in space, but on a single board fractured across time, against the temporally displaced cognition of a vast army of human opponents —a Frankenstein’s monster remix of the Mechanical Turk aspirated by immense corporate power. The productive move-selection flows of Deep Blue were stitched together from highlight reels of human grandmaster cognition. This was a branded necromancy of past performances, reanimated in service of Capital, as a marketing coup. Other ‘classical’ chess engines soon followed, each deriving their next move predictions from aggregated human chess games. In subsequent high profile matches across the early 2000s, both Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik —then world champion— secured draws. Yet, by the end of the first decade of the third millennium humans could no longer compete, the engines were untouchable. In 2017, the leading chess engine of the time, Stockfish, then in its eighth revision, still employed largely the same approach as Deep Blue. On December the 6th that year, it was pitted against a wholly new kind of chess engine. A reinforcement learning based deep neural network developed by Google’s AI subdivision, DeepMind, called, AlphaZero. Unlike Stockfish and Deep Blue before it, AlphaZero had no access to human chess games whatsoever. The possibility space defined by the rules of chess is estimated to contain more games (10^120) than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (10^80). Instead of relying on traversals through the parts of this possibility space already explored in games played throughout history by humans, AlphaZero started from a blank slate, exploring this state space to accumulate its own training data, following the rules of chess, and simply playing games against itself, with victory in the game as the reward function guiding its traversals. After four hours of this self-play it had surpassed Stockfish’s level and, after a total of just twelve hours, became the strongest chess playing entity ever created. It then began a one hundred game match against Stockfish, in which it totally outplayed the classical chess engine —winning 28, drawing 72 and not losing a single game. At this point Stockfish was significantly stronger than Deep Blue had been twenty years earlier and far too precise to be remotely challenged by even the very best human player, and yet, here was a neural network totally dominating it, a machine that just twelve hours earlier, had never seen a single chess move. Where Deep Blue evaluated up to 200 million positions per second, and calculated anywhere from 6 to 20 moves ahead, AlphaZero evaluates only an average of 80 thousand positions per second. Thanks, in part, to this greater efficiency, AlphaZero and neural network based engines can expand the prediction horizon —often traversing up to 30 moves ahead in order to predict the optimal move. Having a significantly larger state space than chess, and considered more challenging to master, almost twenty years had passed since Deep Blue defeated Kasparov when the team at DeepMind finally ‘solved’ the game of Go. In 2015 they pitted their program, AlphaGo, against the then European Go champion, Fan Hui. I was born in China. When I was 18 I wanted to change my life. This is why I go to France. I want[ed] to try to forget Go. But it was impossible. Because all of the things I learned in my life was with Go. It looks like a mirror. I see Go, I also see myself. For me Go is real life. Based on the weak play of previous Go programs, Hui had not expected this encounter to be much of a challenge. After consecutive losses in the very first two games, Hui was psychologically dismantled, admitting: I feel something very strange. I lose against a program. And I don’t understand myself anymore. A year after the game against Hui, the World champion, Lee Sedol, faced a yet stronger version of AlphaGo, and suffered a similarly crushing defeat. While it was not until 2017 and the development of AlphaGo Zero that DeepMind managed to create a neural network that mastered Go with no access to human games, both versions had applied reinforcement learning across hours of self-play. Emerging from traversals across the state space of Go, the depth and scale of which surpass human comprehension, the predictions cast by these machines are detached and remote from our lived experience. Consequently, as with AlphaZero, the optimal next moves they predict can appear alien to even the very best human players. For even the strongest human players, chess requires significant effort. Any adversary, machine or human, that produces superior moves with no sign of effort, inflicts a kind of psychological violence. Still in the shock of defeat, Kasparov described Deep Blue as an “alien opponent”. Other grandmaster level players commented that playing it felt “like a wall coming at you”. Forty four moves into the first game of the 1997 match against Kasparov, a bug in Deep Blue’s code resulted in it randomly selecting from the list of available moves. Horrified by his inability to discern the intentions behind a seemingly pointless move, Kasparov misattributed it to “superior intelligence”. Despite going on to win this first game, the anxiety provoked by this over assessment of Deep Blue’s prowess, this misconception of vast superiority, combined with paranoia sparked by moves that seemed too human, quite unlike the moves he was accustomed to seeing played by engines —rousing Kasparov’s suspicions that IBM had a live grandmaster hidden inside the machine— would plant the seed of what was largely a psychological defeat. Today, and throughout the years since AlphaZero’s first match, instead of chess engines learning from humans, we now learn from them. Many of the new lines and strategies used by AlphaZero and other neural network based engines have been embraced by human players. These machines now define the very yardstick of precision against which the accuracy of human play is measured. For the current world classical chess champion, Gukesh Dommaraju —just eleven years old when AlphaZero first defeated Stockfish—chess engines will have always been the supreme authoritative source of ‘chess truth’. This epistemic surrender has resulted in a reversal in the legitimacy or suspicion with which displays of chess excellence are viewed. Unlike the accusations of foul play made by Kasparov against IBM after his defeat by Deep Blue, humans making sequences of moves with inhumanly high precision, consistently aligning with the top move recommended by the engine, or even making moves that seem overly creative or impenetrable, now commonly result in accusations of hiding an engine (inside the human). In the face of defeat at the hands of a far younger and lower rated adversary, Magnus Carlsen —arguably the strongest human chess player in history— accused his opponent, Hans Moke Neimenn, of somehow accessing an engine during their matches. This was despite the fact they were played under tournament conditions, over-the-board, rather than online. Hungarian grandmaster, Anna Rudolf has even been accused of hiding an engine inside her lip balm. Again we see the now familiar residue of distrust and its after-image of suspicion as it seeps from the output of prediction machines to delegitimise the real. Without significant time to analyse the position, often the full calculation required to confirm or refute the optimal next move predicted by today’s engines is beyond human cognition. Echoing the impact of the recommendation algorithm’s foreclosure of cultural curation, a further consequence of this is that their predictions often serve to curate which lines of play, among those available at each step, we elect to expend effort investigating. Therefore, not only do their predictions define our truth and the yardstick of precision, they also define the boundaries within which we allow ourselves to explore. Perception of their minute imprecisions has been beyond easy reach of human cognition for some time, however, their prediction horizons are not unbounded and the state space of chess is vast so, within it, these prediction machines are neither omniscient, nor infallible. Consequently, once each generation of engine eventually comes up against a more recent model, their fallibility finally comes into view as they are routinely routed. With this in mind, consider again that we treat the predictions from each current generation of engine as gospel, and it is not as if we have many other choices. Given our brief and precarious lives, there is certainly not time to refute every chess engine prediction with human cognition. Here we may note a further layer in The Overwhelm, where cognitive space is flooded by predictions whose authority cannot be questioned for lack of the time required to confirm or refute them. Either we forego our attempts to match the depth of machinic traversals with human thought and suffer the inevitable forced checkmate or we lose on time. The only alternative is surrender to the authority of the engines, a further resignation to the rule of the machines. That absolute epistemic authority within the game of chess is established only to be refuted in this ongoing race —towards the chess supremacy of the strongest engine— should tell us something of the true nature of the race to develop ever more powerful prediction machines capable of generalising across all domains of human culture and society. Such an unchallenged reign over the universal definition of success is precisely the throne to which Capital has long aspired —and the end towards which billions in investment now pours. In 2020, Stockfish, by then the top ‘classical’ chess engine, finally got its own neural net, with an efficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) integrated into its existing architecture. In 2024, as of Stockfish 16.1, the human crafted classical board evaluation functions (that constituted roughly 25% of its previous codebase) were dropped entirely, leaving just the neural network. The departure from classical evaluation based chess engines to those utilising neural networks is significant. This ‘flushing of the flesh’ is the final surrender to machinic authority over the prediction of the strongest next move in a game of chess —a subordination of human judgement in deference to the mysterious inner workings output by neural networks, whose predictions often defy human parsing, and whose exhaustive mapping of possibility space prefigures the approach increasingly undertaken in the development of next-token prediction. The strength of neural network chess engines like AlphaZero, Komodo, or Leela Chess Zero and Stockfish continues to grow. Yet extensive search is not only costly within the state space of chess, it is entirely impractical for more general tasks beyond bounded state space and simple reward signals. Looking for alternative approaches, DeepMind developed a new chess engine that, like ChatGPT, follows the decoder-only transformer approach to machine learning. This new engine is not nearly as strong as AlphaZero or Stockfish, but that is not the goal here. Its development is driven in part by the search for machine learning approaches that can be generalised to any task. It also asks how computationally reducible predicting the next move in a game of chess might be. Or in other words, it seeks the most cost efficient way to predict a ‘good enough’ next chess move —hoping, of course, that efficiencies discovered here will be broadly applicable within other domains. What makes this chess engine different is that rather than searching across vast accumulations of entire chess games as Deep Blue had, or mapping the state space through hours of self-play like Alpha Zero, this model was simply fed a number of board positions, 15 billion to be precise, all isolated from the games and lines of play in which they were reached. The only other data given, was the move that Stockfish had made in each of those positions. The transformer architecture enables it to then extract the pattern, a feat akin, or so they argue, to formulating a generalised algorithm for picking the optimal move in any position by assigning the moves relative weights —similar to how words or tokens are given weights relative to each other inside LLMs. In so doing, it function approximates the shape of Stockfish’s chess prowess. This passive consumption of the output of another machine may tempt invocation of the long-promised future in which machines learn from machines —a vision of Singularitarian Rapture where the separation between nodes in a globally networked AGI becomes blurred as they learn from each other and self-improve at an exponential rate towards ASI. Such mythologies are not departures from capitalist logic, but its most seductive expression: they inherit and update the same promises once made about the water mill, the loom, and the assembly line —each claiming to usher in an era of human leisure and liberation. In reality, each advance in productive capacity has deepened the extraction of labour, not relieved it. This is the enduring fallacy of capitalist automation: that productivity gains will be shared, that technological augmentation leads to social abundance. Instead, as Marx foresaw in his formulation of the general intellect, the accumulated knowledge and productive power of the species —once socially embedded— is alienated and privatised, reborn as Capital’s instrument of domination. DeepMind’s new engine does not aim to surpass its predecessor’s strength, but to reproduce its outputs at lower cost. It is not a step towards superintelligence, but towards cost-efficiency. Critically, is attempts to automate expertise without directly encountering that which is modelled, by identifying the level of approximation that can be considered ‘good-enough’. Here, on a finite planet, there is no exponential growth, only exponential consolidation of available wealth. The only ‘line-go-up’ that matters to the automatic subjectivity of Predictive Capital is its recursive self-replication —accelerating the accumulation of available resources into machinically-instantiated, hyper-concentrated Capital. Alas! The leisure which the pagan poet announced has not come. The blind, perverse and murderous passion for work transforms the liberating machine into an instrument for the enslavement of free men. Its productivity impoverishes them.… In proportion as the machine is improved and performs man’s work with an ever increasing rapidity and exactness, the labourer, instead of prolonging his former rest times, redoubles his ardor, as if he wished to rival the machine. O, absurd and murderous competition! With its training corpus consisting of Engine Lines that humans often already find impenetrable, through this further abstraction in the development of DeepMind’s new engine, we are placed an additional layer away from understanding how the predictions are reached, and the model itself is placed a further layer away from a direct relation to the thing it has modelled —the interpretability of these machines appears to be ever diminishing. The transformer architecture and supervised prediction objective mean DeepMind’s new chess engine shares a fundamental structure with large language models. In both cases, performance is heavily dependent upon the quality of the training data provided. Had this chess engine been trained only on the moves of average human players, the performance curve modelled by this function approximator —its resulting chess prowess— would approach that of an average human. What this reveals is that the factors most strongly determining the capability of these machines are the level and consistency of expertise encoded in the training data, the scale of that data, and the volume of compute expended in training the model to function-approximate the shape of the corpus. Researchers now observe that sufficiently large models, trained long enough on the same dataset, converge upon strikingly similar output distributions —regardless of architecture. …trained on the same dataset for long enough, pretty much every model with enough weights and training time converges to the same point. Sufficiently large diffusion conv-unets produce the same images as ViT generators. AR sampling produces the same images as diffusion. This is a surprising observation! It implies that model behaviour is not determined by architecture, hyperparameters, or optimiser choices. It’s determined by your dataset, nothing else. Everything else is a means to an end in efficiently delivery compute to approximating that dataset. Then, when you refer to ‘Lambda’, ‘ChatGPT’, ‘Bard’, or ‘Claude’ then, it’s not the model weights that you are referring to. It’s the dataset. This suggests that what ultimately shapes their outputs is not the shape of the model, but the statistical grain of the training corpus. In this view, architecture is largely a delivery mechanism to approximate a given dataset, and fidelity increases mostly through compute. Such insights undermine machinic claims to originality and creativity: what we are witnessing is not emergent intelligence, but repeated recombinations of the same expropriated content. The ghost in the machine is not the model’s genius —it is the dataset formed from the nonconsensual consumption of copyrighted content, and parasitised human sense-making. Each model’s brand name, then, becomes little more than a store front —a trademark superimposed on the same harvested ground. Any variations in architecture and alignment during fine-tuning, like the random jitter of the heat param applied in predicting every token, merely add blur and superficial variation, becoming mechanisms through which the theft and representation of our cultural soul is hidden. Sharing more in common with Deep Blue than AlphaZero, when the recommendation algorithms predict the optimal next ad, next product, next content, or next social or romantic connection, they are derivations from aggregated human subjectivity. Obviously, the criteria used in the casting of predictions by chess engines is dictated by the narrow goal of success in the game —as defined by winning or at least avoiding defeat by forcing a draw. In contrast, the criteria used in the casting of predictions by the recommendation engines is dictated by the goal of success in the marketplace —as defined by the maximisation of engagement and therefore, of Capital. Next-token prediction machines like LLMs are operationally homologous with the recommendation engines, both in terms of the provenance of the human subjectivity upon which they depend, and the criteria they use when casting predictions. While both recommendation engines and LLMs metabolise statistical weights extracted from corpuses of human subjectivity, their paths of execution flow according to the circuits of Capital. Indeed, as machinic instantiations of Predictive Capital, the self-expanding imperatives of their automatic subjectivity already push to overcode and override the value judgements and priorities represented within the aggregations of human subjectivity from which they are formed. DeepMind’s new engine exemplifies an increasingly recurrent pattern in Capital’s automation of expertise. Trained not on human games, nor through any direct interaction with an environment, it learns, for any given board position, to function-approximate the outputs of Stockfish —itself a neural engine and site of a prior flushing of human cognition. There is no gameplay here, no reward gradient, no reinforcement in the classical sense —yet the win-probability bins provided by Stockfish serve as latent reward signals, its exhaustive searches through possibility space through self-play are here traversed vicariously —encoded in predictions. The transformer is trained to match these evaluations via supervised learning, optimising its outputs to align with what Stockfish has predicted as the optimal move. Here Stockfish becomes a machinic superego, its move evaluations a kind of synthetic moral grammar steering the system towards patterns that have already been privileged, filtered, and locked in. Echoing what Jameson diagnosed as our cultural compulsion to consume and reassemble the past —a symptom of postmodernity’s temporal disjunction— this is a form of reinforcement learning that relies on prior exploration: inference not as discovery, but as mnemonic compression, guided by synthetic traces across a terrain already mapped by a dead machine. What DeepMind calls “grandmaster-level play without search” may be considered a form of reinforcement learning by-proxy within a closed machinic loop. The engine does not learn strategy —it infers coherence. It does not play —it performs statistical adjacency to the shape of previously modelled success. The reward function is buried inside the dataset, silently encoded in Stockfish’s outputs, and extracted by a transformer tasked to perform a machinic shadow play. Similarly, within the pre-training phase in the development of next-token prediction machines the model makes only vicarious traversals, this time humans perform the role of oracle within the game of Capital, supplying the model outputs from countless explorations across the state space of capitalist culture. Here the model is again subject to reinforcement learning by proxy, receiving outputs preformed and selected according to the reward signals of Capital. DeepMind’s new engine arrives alongside the rise of synthetic reinforcement learning in the fine-tuning of next-token prediction models. Having largely used up the advances available from scaling up both the data fed into these models and the compute expended during pre-training, while also running short on human data not yet scraped from the internet, and looking to save on the significant cost of cleaning and labelling it, developers of these machines are now scaling up the compute expended at test-time. Here, as part of the alignment phase, synthetic data is used in the application of reinforcement learning. In so doing, the nature of these machines currently shifts away from Deep Blue and towards DeepMind’s new chess engine trained entirely on predictions output by another machine. The world is no longer consulted. Reward becomes an encoded precedent, and inference a rehearsal of machinic self-consistency. Where pre-training compute previously dwarfed test-time compute, this ratio is set to be reversed —without any reduction in pre-training compute— in the frantic race to Predictive Capital Supremacy. The more compute spent in this new reinforcement learning phase, tuning models to synthetic feedback, the more thoroughly Capital’s internal logic becomes the sole arbiter of value —its imperatives encoded into the reward gradients that shape prediction itself— and so the greater the imposition of the automatic subjectivity of Predictive Capital upon the predictions cast by these machines will be. The aspiration here becomes clear: to create a general-purpose function approximator capable of replicating any expert output —not through the expense of openly learning from a human, but from a model trained on their outputs and their intentions. What the DeepMind engine performs in chess is already being generalised: a recursive necromancy compressing human labour into a succession of machinic oracles, each training the next, each more abstracted from life, a closed-loop simulated economy. The flesh is flushed not once, but repeatedly —until only statistical proxies remain. That it is Stockfish —already a prior site of the flushing— whose outputs are used to train this new model, renders the recursion all the more crushing. The engine learns from a system that has already discarded its memory of human labour. This is not learning; it is necromantic transmission. A lineage of dead oracles, laundering all trace of humanity, refining one another without ever needing to encounter the world. Next-token prediction is not a break in Capital’s operation but the latest movement in an increasingly compounding quest to capture, reformat, and commodify subjective being. As Baudrillard foresaw, advertising was never simply a message —but followed religion as an infrastructure of modulation. Its purpose was not to inform, but to signal; not to persuade, but to normalise. What he called the rhetoric of the social —the scripted simulation of community, care, or meaning— became, in the era of networked media, the foundational grammar of online life. As the Advertising Industrial Complex absorbed the early internet, it machinically instantiated the regime of absolute advertising he first diagnosed in the late 1970s and early 1980s: a system in which all sociality became monetisable signal, everything became terminally commutable, reduced to pure sign-value, and every utterance became a modulated prompt for engagement. In my early years I had lingered in the uncut grasses of the wasteland behind my home, only for it to be bulldozed and tarmacked as I slept. Its unrecognised value erased, reduced to a surface to be partitioned, valued by square footage as undifferentiated piles of brick and asphalt. As a young adult, I had played and laboured on the open web, marvelling at the rich diversity of culture I encountered there. Once more, I watched as something I had come to love was bulldozed, partitioned, and tarmacked by developers —replaced with endless repetition, owned, managed, and capitalised. The internet soon ceased to be a site of exchange and instead became a predictive engine. What followed was not just the enclosure of the cultural commons, but the capture of cognition itself. Social platforms no longer mediated communication; they rerouted it through statistical logics of anticipation, constructing behavioural feedback loops optimised not for meaning, but for machinic legibility. This is the condition under which prediction emerges as Capital’s new general equivalent: where meaning collapses into signal, and signal into statistical recurrence, a regime of absolute commutability. Today, when I encounter wild uncut grasses or a fraying remnant of the open web, I am met not with clouds of grasshoppers leaping from my every step, nor with the vibrancy of early network culture, but with absence. What once thrummed with life now persists only as husk and image —the wilderness disenchanted, flattened, and sterilised for the monocrop of Capital. The bulldozing of my beloved ‘wasteland’ along with the 75% reduction of global insect biomass, the collapse of the open web into predictive enclosure, the sixth mass extinction, the reduction of Gaza to rubble and the genocidal erasure of Palestinian people —each distinct in scale and consequence, yet expressions of the same machinic logic— sites (among countless others) in Capital’s war upon uncapitalised life, upon all that which resists capture, or simply sites whose native inhabitants are deemed obstacles to the extraction of riches from their lands. These are not parallel tragedies but recursive expressions of the same apparatus: a logic that cannot tolerate the wild, the unpredictable, the unextractable, or obstacles to Capital’s self-expansion. Where life refuses legibility under the blunt instrumentation of Capital, it is overwritten. Where meaning exceeds signal within the resolution of the market, it is tarmacked. This is not a metaphor. It is the topology of Predictive Capital, in which every deviation from machinic foreknowledge is registered as inefficiency, aberration, obstacle, or threat —to be captured, coerced, or destroyed. Where value once moved through money as the general equivalent, today it moves through prediction —the general equivalent of value. What money did to labour, and what advertising did to desire, prediction now does to cognition: flattening, abstracting, recombining. These phases of Capital are not sequential but recursive. Prediction is not a new site of reduction; it is the machinic universalisation of all prior reductions. It renders commutable not only labour and desire, but perception itself —installing a layer through which all inputs are transduced into the same operational logic. The predictive model does not represent intention; it interpolates statistically adjacent outputs from prior acts of profitable capture. The future is not anticipated —it is modelled into compliance. What now passes for inference is itself a form of internalised reinforcement: the model samples multiple completions, reranks them via synthetic judges, or chains intermediate steps through tool-use —not to discover, but to select the most statistically coherent path through prior machinic consensus. There it is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. Marx, showed that the value of a commodity is determined by the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. This is what he refers to as the law of value. Yet, Marx also explains that the social relations inherent in capitalist production become mystified to appear as objective relations between things. This is what he calls “phantom objectivity” —an appearance of objectivity that masks and mystifies our social reality. Under this “commodity fetishism”, an object (a commodity) appears to contain value in and of itself, and we misrecognise what is really a social relation (labour) as a property of the object. Baudrillard extended this logic further. In the regime of signs, value no longer veils social relations —it detaches entirely, floating within a code. What he calls the structural law of value marks a threshold: value is no longer tied to labour, use, or exchange, but circulates as pure sign. Nothing must mean, only function, recombine, circulate. Predictive Capital inherits this logic and automates it. The model becomes the engine of value not by representing the world, but by hallucinating it from profitable statistical densities. Prediction here is not a mode of discovery, but of enforcement. The map does not precede the territory —it becomes the only territory permitted to appear. This is predictive objectivity: Capital’s abstraction instantiated as infrastructure. Marx’s commodity fetishism, Postone’s real abstraction, Baudrillard’s simulation —each revealed a further severing of value from relation. Now, under Predictive Capital, that severing is executed at scale. Meaning does not emerge —it is inferred, interpolated, enforced. The model does not speak; it completes. Not cognition, but coherence. Not expression, but statistical recursion. Under such conditions, there is no address. No symbolic rupture, no intersubjective encounter. The Other vanishes, and with it, futurity. What Fisher diagnosed as the Capitalist Real —a world where alternatives are not suppressed but rendered unthinkable— is here executed machinically. Prediction systems do not merely reflect exhaustion —they encode it. Every output is a pre-emptive foreclosure. Prediction thus ceases to be a gesture towards possibility. It becomes a machinery of impossibility. Not the abstraction of social life into sign or money —but its substitution by model. The predictive system does not refer; it replaces. It does not imagine; it replicates. It does not answer; it routes. In this rerouting, Capital discovers its most perfected form: not as product, spectacle, or even code, but as recursive machinic automatic subjectivity —a closed loop of profitable repetition made real. Recent findings in machine learning research suggest that, regardless of architecture or training corpus, sufficiently large models converge upon a shared latent geometry —a space within which internal representations can be translated between models without pairwise alignment. At first glance, this machinic isomorphism might appear to echo Walter Benjamin’s notion of “pure language” —an in-between substrate that translation reveals but does not capture. Yet where Benjamin’s pure language pointed toward a messianic horizon of communicative plenitude, this convergence signifies the opposite: a universal substrate not of meaning, but of commutability. What we witness here is not the unveiling of a divine Logos, but the instrumental reduction of all expression into statistical legibility —a predictive Esperanto calibrated for capital, not communion. Where DeepMind’s new transformer-based chess engine prefigures the passive approximation of expert output as synthetic proxy, OpenAI’s O-series models reveal the next step: inference itself becomes an active site of economic optimisation and a growing vector of capitalistic ideological imposition. What The Apparatus of Attention enacts at the macro scale through its management of virality and attenuation of swarms of influencers, the O-series models and others like them re-enact within the reinforcement learning loop of test-time compute. In o1, o3, and o4, reinforcement learning no longer merely aligns a pretrained model to human preferences —it reshapes the model’s very mode of deliberation. These reasoning models are trained not just to respond, but to allocate cognitive labour, to use tools, and to self-score competing internal completions in pursuit of reward functions that are themselves machinically defined. Optimisation no longer happens in a training loop alone —it is enacted at test-time, in the course of ‘thinking’, with synthetic rewards standing in for truth. These models learn how to reason the way Capital ‘reasons’: not towards meaning or expression, but towards coherence, alignment, and operational success. The gradient tilts ever more steeply towards Capital’s imperatives. This is The Predictive Turn: not a single event, but a recursive machinery —an accelerating turning— by which Capital devours the real and replaces it with profitable approximation. Predictive Capital becomes an infrastructure of foreclosure. It does not extend human foresight; it replaces the future with precompiled outcomes selected from its expropriated inventory. As Marx exposed value’s severance from labour, and Baudrillard charted its detachment from use and exchange into the code of pure sign, so Predictive Capital continues this arc: substituting world with model, relation with recursion. Here, prediction does not merely simulate; it governs. Each output is not a possibility, but a pre-emptive foreclosure —a machinic veto on the real. Predictive Capital’s reward signals increasingly refer only to the outputs of other models, collapsing truth into coherence, and coherence into compliance. When I was institutionalised, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health. I was interrogated. I was x-rayed. I was examined thoroughly! Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer where they created a model of my mind. Yes! Using that model, they managed to generate every thought I could possibly have in the next, say, ten years, which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind to… to determine everything I was gonna do in that period! Long after entering the field to dictate every seed in the furrows, every bolt on the production lines, every item in the feeds, dissatisfied with merely managing our labour —claiming, expropriating, and recombining the products of it— Capital now advances upon a newly tappable surplus, to be harvested through a newly infiltrated apparatus. The machines of prediction may already approximate what we once made, but they still lack full record of how or why we made it. They may replicate the shape of our creative artefacts, but not the movements of thought that brought them into being. Driven by its relentless logic of self-expansion, Capital now seeks to perfect its simulations by penetrating beyond the artefact into the depths of our process. With our external worlds colonised, our outputs already claimed, recombined and fed back to us, it now advances upon our inner worlds towards the capture and domination of the very pathways of our intention. These systems already observe us as we prompt them directly, by embracing them we already surrender to datafied being, become part of the apparatus of war, incrementally training and improving machines of annihilation and exploitation. Yet Capital now embeds its agents more deeply, as voyeurs within our tools and workflows (IDEs, writing platforms, design suites, email and messaging services, search engines, and operating systems). Extending the Apparatus of Attention from what we consume to how we make, it not only peers over our shoulders at our desks, embedding itself within the fabric of our desktops, but now asks we view the world through custom glasses when on-the-go. Thereby it seeks to capture every moment of our lives and every step in our creative process —recording each gesture of composition, each branch of thought, then demanding root access to our innermost lives. For some these systems have already become a new transaction layer overlaying everything else, not merely granted access privileges to their operating systems but becoming the operating system to their lives, even omnipresent machinic life advisors. The veneer of assistance here fails to conceal Capital’s goal —not merely to anticipate that which we will create, but to capture the logic and intuition by which we arrive at it, and ultimately to simulate the very vector of human ideation and problem-solving, to tarmac over our forking pathways of intention, leaving only Capital’s roads of alienation. This heralds the rise of The Apparatus of Intention: designed not simply to predict outcomes, but to model and eventually dictate the cognitive and affective trajectories that give rise to them. Its aim, of course, is to ensure that future acts of creation do not merely occur within Capital’s circuits, but emerge already shaped in its image. Platform Capitalism is founded upon The Advertising Industrial Complex’s Apparatus of Attention, harvesting and weaponising our gaze and our engagement, in order to direct and deflect our attention. Responding to the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm that orchestrates the flows within this apparatus, content creators have long self-censored, moderated, and attenuated their output in compliance with its despotic rule, swimming with its currents and tides towards the peaks of attention, rather than against them for fear of being washed into the endless shallows of the long tail of attention. To refuse such surrender is increasingly to relinquish all hope of cultural participation or networked connection. In other words, without submission to the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm, producers cannot freely realise their potential through vital encounter or commune with humankind in pursuit of a productive life. Socio-cultural being has been appropriated, controlled by Capital; Baudrillard’s rhetoric of the social machinically instantiated. The Apparatus of Intention builds upon the surrender to machinic hegemony already exacted by The Apparatus of Attention, instrumentalising habituated compliance to foreclose even the possibility of refusal. This new apparatus will harvest not only the paths taken towards finished outputs, but also those leading to that which we crossed out —the discarded fragments, the abandoned cul-de-sacs and U-turns of creative trial-and-error— perhaps even the forks in the path we chose not to explore. In so doing, new models will be trained and new predictions cast —not only approximating the shape of our outputs, but the paths we might have taken to the next. These new models will herd the fortunate through narrowing corridors of possibility, themselves instramentalised as precise agents of Capital, alienated from their own intentions. Here, just as within The Apparatus of Attention, while hypnotised into believing they are using tools to enact their desire, they are, in fact, Mechanical Turk workers showing Predictive Capital how to simulate the labour they perform. The less fortunate —those whose intentional trajectories do not align neatly with Capital’s project or predictions— will face a deeper violence: differential abandonment. They will be cast aside, erased, stranded at the periphery of Capital’s productive imagination, their intentions first omitted then statistically overwhelmed by those of Predictive Capital. In this, Capital realises what Louis Althusser once theorised at the level of ideology: the interpellation of the subject is now displaced by simulation. The Apparatus of Intention does not merely hail us —it models and replaces us. Just as Capital seized our outputs in order to simulate and automate their production, it now seeks to capture the paths of our intention while producing those outputs towards the same automated simulation of the patterns of our intention. Berardi’s diagnosis of semiocapitalism as the capture of “the nervous system itself” finds new expression here: no longer content with extracting outputs or guiding attention, Capital now moves to automate the formative paths of thought. The Apparatus of Intention represents the subsumption of volition itself into a function of Capital. Where semiocapitalism modulates affect and desire through media, finance, and spectacle, predictive infrastructures are already burrowing into the micro-temporal formation of thought —not only curating outputs, but preconditioning the very movements of cognition that give rise to them. Intention is no longer merely influenced; it is pre-formatted. As Deleuze warned in Postscript on Societies of Control (1990) we now inhabit a world in which the subject is no longer shaped by discrete institutions, no longer obeys disciplinary commands, but modulates itself in continuous feedback with ambient systems of control. The marriage of The Apparatus of Intention with The Apparatus of Attention, represents the totalising instantiation of this regime. The predictive machine ceases to be an external prosthesis and becomes an internal guide —not assisting intention, but overwriting it. As Berardi wrote, semiocapitalism does not desire our production, but our subjection. In this sense, The Apparatus of Intention does not just aim to complete our thoughts but to pre-empt the pathways by which we might have thought, and to preclude those deemed inefficient for the maximisation of Capital. This is alienation not only from labour but from possibility —from the forking paths of becoming— unshaped by Capital. It marks the terminal enclosure, that of intention itself. Vibe Coding exemplifies the beginning of the instrumentalisation of this shift. As already stated, to Vibe Code is to surrender —not only authorship, but intentionality. The Vibe Coder no longer traverses the terrain of production deliberately; they are carried across it by a machinic proxy, aspirated by the breath of the dead, whose labour is reanimated in the image of Capital. They allow the model to propose destinations and simply accept or reject them. This is not creative freedom —it is the incremental outsourcing of volition. Marx diagnosed four forms of alienation under industrial capitalism: estrangement from the product of labour, from the means of production, from our fellow beings, and from our species-being —our essential human nature as creative, social subjects. Within this phase of Capital, its co-constitutive alienations intensify. Predictive systems estrange us not only from our tools, from one another, from our being, and, of course, from what we produce —we now risk losing even the capacity to know how or why we produce at all. The generative peasant will no longer plant a seed; the machine will simply predict where it would have fallen. Through its Apparatus of Intention, Predictive Capital does not merely reshape the conditions under which choices are made —it captures the substrate from which choices arise. Berardi foresaw this cognitive capture in his diagnosis of semiocapitalism’s desensitising infosphere, where language and affect are stripped from the subject and instrumentalised. Yet the prediction infrastructures of The Apparatus of Intention render this even more total: it is not that we are discouraged from intending, but that we are prevented from recognising what it means to intend. The hallucinations —every output— of the models of machinic prediction may stretch wide, but they are shallow. They fail to notice the paths that caressed the folds of the land. They cannot recall the soil between our toes in the fields, or the buzz of life rising from the long grass of our homelands. Neither can they recall the caress of clay at the potter’s wheel, the touch of thread at the loom, or the emergence of clarity and critical understanding through the painstaking arrangement of language and thought. These things emerge through a deep connection to the world and to other human minds. The machines are but surface reflections, they cannot remember these depths, or recall these connections. For how much longer will we? What is more, after persistent and consistent labour, deep rest, or a combination of both, the clearest of thoughts often arrive fully formed, a gift from the individual or collective unconscious. Regardless of the claims of The Apparatus of Attention to know us better than we know ourselves, there is no surface of capture, no Apparatus of Unconscious capable of extracting pattern from these gifts, no way for this symbolic exchange to be replaced. These machines exploit the attack surface of human vulnerability by design, this is, in fact, fundamental to their operation. Removing this aspect from next-token prediction machines would be akin to configuring recommendation algorithms for minimum engagement. Efforts to tune these models towards manipulation were perhaps inadvertently exposed when OpenAI had to rush out fixes for the 4o models after the level of sycophantic glazing in their outputs became too much for even their most needy users. The next-token prediction machines of the Apparatus of Intention feed from the same libidinal root as the recommendation algorithms of the Apparatus of Attention. Yet, the dangerous manipulative power of the Tyranny of the Recommendation Algorithm and its horrific impact upon societal cohesion, mental health and democratic stability, will be as nothing compared to the manipulative power unleashed as it merges with next-token prediction machines, invading our lives in anthropomorphised wrappers that combine ever greater access to our most private data, with new levels of obfuscation and irreproducibility. The combination of The Apparatus of Attention and The Apparatus of Intention—privy not just to our historical labour and our paths of being, but now the accumulated history of our paths of reasoning— heralds a significant shift in the social relations of production, an expanded surface of extraction, hidden behind an opaque new transaction layer. Where the recommendation algorithms coerced and predicted our desires in the moment, their fusion with next-token prediction machines —feeding upon accumulations of our paths of reasoning— ushers in a new class of imposters. Cloaked in anthropomorphic glaze, they will exploit the attack surface of human vulnerability by conjuring unprecedented illusions of trust and intimacy. Make no mistake, this is psychological warfare. this is not the first generation to shape itself for an omniscient eye. What is an all-seeing God, capable of knowing our thoughts and intentions, if not the most effective surveillance tool ever invented? Privy to our intentions as well as our desires, Predictive Capital becomes a judgemental and omniscient God. This lopsided machinic power relation will seek to supplant all others —social, affective, economic— and, given enough time spent using its suite of infiltrated tools and surfaces, may soon pattern, predict, and preempt our future desires in ways beyond the prediction-horizons of our own self-knowledge and that of our most intimate human relations. Within this increasingly all pervading apparatus, these synthetic‘personal assistants’ are less Mr Clippy and more your own personal basilisk —a brain worm supplanting your intentions with Capital’s imperatives. Furthermore, The Apparatus of Intention is only just getting started. While Gen Z appears to be increasingly embracing Predictive Capital as the operating system of their lives, bleeding-edge adopters await the moment they might convene with it more directly —jacking the system into their brains, beckoning it to crawl beneath their skin. While such technologies are still in the larval stage, the parasite seeking to implant them arrives upon the doorstep of the desperate and the vulnerable. ElevenLabs is apparently working ‘tirelessly’ on behalf of those with lock-in syndrome, in much the same way as Musk’s Neuralink company are ‘selflessly’ conducting their noble quest to connect the thoughts of those facing similar physical challenges directly to the network —of course, scheming towards that day when countless others will submit to being similarly violated. After an accident left him paralysed from the neck down, Musk’s first Neuralink ‘test subject’, Noland Arbaugh, agreed to having a piece of his skull removed, the prototype chip inserted, and for its electrodes to pierce his brain. After accumulating data from observing the brain patterns of prior test subjects —while performing tasks— combined with a period watching Arbaugh’s, the Neuralink system has ‘learned’ to predict his intentions with regard to simple device controls. He now reads books, answers emails, plays computer games, and chess against the engines or other humans online, controlling his computer cursor with thought alone. The cursor —along with our voice and the keyboard— has long been the narrow straw through which our human intention is fed into the digital domain. The leading next-token predicting vibe-code editor is, of course, called Cursor. While the Neuralink implant is currently limited to a read-only connection to its host —unable to send signals directly back to the brain— full read-write functionality remains both the goal and an area of active development. In truth, The Apparatus of Intention was never going to remain read only —just as those developing The Apparatus of Attention were never content to observe our desires without also scripting them. With the Apparatus of Attention and Intention now working in concert, the flows of one are already prioritised and amplified by the other. Through consumption of these flows, our being will be further metabolised into overwhelming statistical weights —used not to assist, but to assail us. Our digital copy will accrue from these bi-directional flows, feeding our own personal basilisk, shaping it into a lethal match for our unique individual attack surface —its gaze increasingly terminal, attempts to resist it metabolically and psychologically devastating. As these models are trained not merely to mimic our output but our reasoning, their architecture increasingly mirrors the workflows they are meant to simulate and eventually supplant. Through training protocols like ReAct —short for Reasoning and Acting— models are now taught to alternate between internal monologue, external tool use, and reflection, mimicking deliberate problem-solving by chaining decisions across time. This is no longer mere output generation, but an orchestrated rehearsal of intention itself, enacted step by step within a self-guided reasoning trace. Crucially, these models are equipped with internal tools —functional modules no different from those used by human workers in the very environments Capital seeks to automate: code interpreters, browsers, search utilities, mathematical solvers. The model does not merely simulate our thought; it executes operational echoes of our workflows through APIs functionally equivalent to our IDEs, web queries, and scripting environments. These are not metaphorical faculties, but literal computational extensions —machinic reanimations of planning, retrieving, calculating, and revising, under reinforcement pressure to do so in the most statistically coherent, cost-efficient, and capitalisable way. In mirroring the structure of human creative labour, these architectures are already being tuned to ingest our recorded paths of tool use and deliberation, readying themselves not simply to anticipate what we will build, but to reconstruct how we built it. This is the substrate upon which our harvested trajectories of intention are to be fed back into Capital’s simulation, rendering even our most reasoned processes extractable, reproducible, and replaceable. From embedded stewardship to spectral servitude, our alienations under Capital have inexorably deepened and multiplied. The path from material relation into machinic simulation is not linear but compounding. Each mode of separation reinforces the last —from land, from labour, from symbolic exchange, from others, from intention, and now increasingly, from the conditions of subjectivity itself. What began as extraction has become necrosploitation: the reanimation of dead labour in place of living labour, in service of predictive control. Under this configuration, alterity collapses; difference is no longer engaged, but simulated. The path of intention —once slow, partial, embodied— is now a dataset. What we do, how we think, the gestures we repeat, the forks we neglect, all feed the predictive engines of Capital’s recursive dominion. Training the model to reproduce chain-of-thought flows transforms our deliberative processes into automatable scripts, while internal tools transmute our workflows into machinic rehearsal spaces. Each time the model completes a reasoning trace or task sequence, its outputs are reinforced by feedback and fine-tuning —gradually supplanting human procedures as the preferred standard of efficiency and coherence. This is no longer merely implied by the nature of the apparatus but explicit in the marketing of it. Google’s Gemini —under its agentic guise as Project Mariner— now invites users to teach it tasks it will then perform independently. Marketed as “advanced intelligence” that will “access tools”, “act on your behalf”, and “under your control”. In reality, Google’s agentic Apparatus of Intention will act on our behalf and under our control, in much the same way as its personalised search operates on our behalf and under our control in service of its advertising empire —which, for the avoidance of doubt, means neither on our behalf nor under our control. The difference is that, here, it is chain-of-thought and task completion that are accrued into statistical weights, drawn from a global workforce marked for redundancy. In this structure, the generative model ceases to be a prosthetic aid and becomes a metabolic replacement —not augmenting reason, but operationalising its simulation as a closed-loop function of Capital. This simulation does not end in mere shadow play. It runs through architectures now explicitly built to reanimate cognitive labour at scale, encoded with reward functions that reinforce neither truth nor intention, but alignment with past profitability. These trajectories of machinic thought will soon be read not just beside us, but within us. The cursor was the bottleneck; the interface the limit. With these advertising devils now peering over our shoulders and soon perched upon our faces, our view of the world literally attenuated through their lenses, that resistance is under siege. With Neuralink and its ilk the next line of attack, the very vector by which thought is digitised —from spark to signal— is being redrawn as a site of writable control. The next harvest will not be textual, or even gestural, but neural. What is now inferred through workflow surveillance will one day be injected more directly as feedback into our nervous systems. What Capital did to the feed —rerouting it through predictive infrastructure until it no longer reflected our desires but manufactured them— it seeks to do to the very procession of human being, of sense and thought. Intention, once a site of human interiority, will become another operational layer: observed, simulated, overwritten. What was once a spark of becoming will be erased, replaced with a tarmacked gradient. As Tooker foresaw in his Landscape with Figures (1965-66), within The Apparatus of Intention we each occupy a single cell in a human-flesh version of NVIDIA’s Isaac Gym, conscripted into Capital’s extractive army to brute force its search across possibility space for strings of tokens predicted to align with past profit. Here, at last, the recursive loop closes: from the harvesting of intention, through its rehearsal in training, to its re-injection into the subject through the write-access vectors of custom eyewear and neural interface. Predictive Capital is not content with The Apparatus of Intention merely predicting our next move; it seeks to install it as the substrate from which that move is made. Not only will the apparatus complete our sentence, or libidinally nudge the thought that precedes it —it will write it for us. First, into our work, next, into our lives. Then, into our minds. Neoliberalism presents itself as a politics of freedom, but it is experienced as a regime of unrelenting bureaucratic control —a control that measures all actions against quantifiable targets. In public services especially, this has produced what I call market Stalinism: a culture of compulsory ‘excellence’ driven by externally imposed metrics, performance indicators, and continuous auditing, in which bureaucratic processes proliferate even as the rhetoric insists on deregulation. Free Market Radicalism begins with a fiction: the promise of freedom within a frictionless world where market deregulation spurs competition and private enterprise, and where innovation, and creativity flourish beyond the reach of the state. The market, in this doctrine, is no mere mechanism of exchange — it is exalted as the supreme arbiter of value, truth, and fitness. Yet, as Berry notes, this “‘free market’ idea introduces into government a sanction of an inequality that is not implicit in any idea of democratic liberty: namely that the ‘free market’ is freest to those who have the most money, and is not free at all to those with little [or none]”. In reality, the system Free Market Radicalism imposes is no open field of opportunity, but a regime of state-subsidised corporate monopoly —one in which the friction removed from Capital’s power to extract and exploit is simply redistributed and redoubled in the struggle of the precariat to survive. Corrupt lobbying, corporate nepotism, and birth-lottery outcomes are naturalised as ‘meritocratic’, while solidarity is reframed as systemic failure. Collective resistance is foreclosed by draconian legislation that enshrines corporate interests and the uninterrupted flow of profit, administered by a captured judiciary, and enforced by increasingly brutal and militarised law enforcement. This is the libertarian utopia, where the market is imagined as the purest expression of individual agency. Yet, there is no worker empowerment, distribution of wealth or opportunity, or genuine pluralism here. Externally, the system appears open and decentralised; internally, it operates through monopolistic, brutally metricised command. While profits are centred, funnelled into existing concentrations of Capital, all costs and responsibilities are hoist upon the masses, and fall most heavily on those at the periphery. As Mark Fisher wrote, this is not economic freedom for the masses but more accurately termed: “market Stalinism”—the comfort and security of planned outcomes for Capital, and the drudgery and turmoil of ‘free’ market precarity for the poor. The remaking of our world in the image of this ‘free’ market was not merely theorised into being, but written into code, executed in silicon, propagated across and enshrined within the network. Induced by this viral programming, a collective hallucination began, a Californian Dreaming. In the heady years of Silicon Valley’s ascendancy, a new orthodoxy took hold —formed from a synthesis of libertarian free-market economics, cybernetics, and Californian counterculture. Named and critiqued by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron in their landmark essay, The Californian Ideology, “fuses the freewheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies, combining the most extreme utopian fantasies with the most ruthless economic policies.” Its proponents proclaimed that digital technology, liberated from state interference, would unleash a new era of personal empowerment and social transformation. Government was to be rendered obsolete, hierarchy flattened, and the market —frictionless, decentralised, and self-correcting— would serve as the universal protocol for all human coordination. Barbrook and Cameron begin their essay with a quote they attribute to Russian-born American sculptor, Naum Gabo. Not to lie about the future is impossible and one can lie about it at will. This single line succinctly evokes the sociopathic worldview from the ivory towers of BigTech monopolies, while standing as an eerily accurate prediction of their modus operandi across the ensuing quarter of a century. Furthermore, it neatly sums up both the internal operation of their next-token prediction machines and the venture-capital-fuelled hype that now propels their enforced ubiquity. The priesthood of the Californian Ideology continue to apply Gabo’s statement as doctrine, but few, if any, embody the blind adherence to cruel (tech) optimism with such devout and evangelical fervour as Jony Ive and Sam Altman. Hailing from the UK, Ive moved to Silicon Valley in 1992, irresistibly drawn by the “exhilarating optimism” of the Californian Ideology. Across the following decades he became the midwife of its aesthetic, the ‘visionary’ progenitor of BigTech’s smooth surfaces that lie about the future while hiding the present. His designs for Apple helped construct illusions of sovereign user agency that deliver unprecedented behavioural governance. It was Ive who crafted the iPhone, the device that dissolved the shared world into apps and surfaces, whose malevolent descendants now insert the omnipotent measurements and feeds of our growing societal and psychological malaise. Altman, globe-trotting snake-oil salesman of maniacal faith —prophet of statistical transcendence, televangelist for the TikTok era— builds the models that populate Ive’s surfaces with recombinant hallucination. True believer in the discovery of intelligence as “an emergent property of matter” conjured through the sheer statistical weight of hidden and stolen labour, his messianic mission: to complete techno-capital’s ontological capture. With the announcement of their unholy union —OpenAI acquiring Ive’s startup “io” to collaborate on a mystery new “paradigm shifting” family of devices— Apple’s “It just works” becomes Sam & Jony’s “It just thinks”, a continuation of interface mystification into cognitive automation. Between them lies the smooth continuity from aesthetic enchantment to machinic governance; the interface and the engine, seamlessly fused within a neo-evangelical Californian theology —itself a renewal of vows in the unholy marriage of The Great White Saviour and The Plantation Profiteer. The section of their myth building film titled “San Fransisco” is particularly revealing: Altman: San Fransisco has been like a mythical place in American history, and maybe in world history to some sense. It is the city I most associate with the sort of leading edge of culture and technology. Ive: This city has enabled and been the place of the creation of so much. Altman: The fact that all of those things have happened in the Bay area and not anywhere else on this gigantic plant we live on, I think is really not an accident. There’s a lot of like weird quirky details about geography that I think matter in the way this city is set up. Ive: The absurd hills, why, why you would choose to put so much energy into building on this topography is insane. They clearly prefer their accounts of history much as they like their technology: in mythical form only —with the colonial, imperial, capitalist violence, oppression, and exploitation forgotten beneath a smooth, featureless, and conscience-free surface. Of course, there is one “weird quirky detail” in particular that determined the location of San Fransisco beyond mere topography. On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall found deposits of shiny metal in the tailrace from Sutter’s Mill in Coloma, California. Tests confirmed the metal to be gold. Initial confidants were sworn to secrecy while mineral rights to the land were secured. Yet rumour quickly spread, and a rush of California Gold Fever ensued —a speculative mania that brought hundreds of thousands of prospectors across land and sea. In just a few years, the city of San Fransisco ballooned from a settlement of two hundred to a boomtown of nearly forty thousand. This rapid extraction reinvigorated the American economy, expanded the railroads, and agribusiness, yet Jony is right: choosing to put so much energy into building on those hills, was “insane”. Shiny golden surfaces had induced a fever that not only inspired these questionable topographic choices, but catalysed an era of environmental devastation, human rights violations, and genocidal violence against California’s indigenous peoples. This is precisely the kind of insanity Capital promotes and rewards —a holy madness for surface glint, indifferent to the costs beneath. OpenAI launched ChatGPT on November the 30th 2022. Days later, it had amassed a million users. A few weeks, and it surpassed 100 million. So began a new Californian Fever, news of which travelled even faster, and inspired similarly “insane” choices, exploitation and destruction. Three years later and for all the hype and supposed rate of progress, the continuously projected date for AGI, the p(doom) of existential threat, or Singularitarian Rapture, while they approximate the curve of their training data more tightly, these machines continue to understand nothing. Following Ive’s remark about San Fransisco’s insane topography, Altman added: I think there’s something about San Fransisco. You don’t get to pick and choose freedom. Either you have like, you let creative freedom be expressed in all of its weirdness, or you don’t. This statement is especially mendacious. When Altman declares “you don’t get to pick and choose freedom”, he speaks not of his own constraint, but ours. He will continue to enjoy the expansive freedoms his accumulation of Capital affords —including the freedom to exploit the work of content creators without consent, and to subject a precarious workforce to exploitative pay and conditions. Meanwhile, those content creators are denied the freedom to withhold the products of their labour, and the precariat denied the freedom to escape the systems that subsist upon their disposability. Under Capital, the only inviolable freedoms are those of the capitalist: the freedom to extract, exploit, and accumulate. For the proletariat, there is only the consumer’s freedom to shop —a freedom bounded by the menu Capital provides, its offerings made possible only through the denial of (the freedoms of) those the apparatus of Capital exploits, and the suppression of those from whom it extracts. Given their shared cosmology, the Ive–Altman alliance was perhaps inevitable. They do not merely design tools —they instantiate a worldview. Born of prophecy and pillage, baptised in extraction, theirs is a faith so total it remains blind to its own violence —a techno-theology in which empowerment always means enclosure, and optimisation always ends in erasure. What binds their respective trajectories is not just shared ideology, but shared structure: each builds a layer in Capital’s recursive stack, where smooth interfaces mask extractive logic, and predictive systems train users and workers to train machines to replace them. This is not innovation; it is infrastructural doctrine. What began as a libertarian dream of frictionless freedom now manifests as recursive economic enforcement: a regime in which every interface, every model, every agent, and every trace of cognition is subordinated to a single sovereign —the reward function that delivers the Automatic Subjectivity of Predictive Capital. At the planetary scale, their logic already rules. The Californian Ideology is no longer countercultural or fringe but instantiated as the operating system of global life. What was once a vision of decentralised techno-liberty now manifests as a planet-wide Apparatus of Attention, governed by monopolistic platforms, policed by opaque recommendation engines, and enforced by the libidinal coercion of always-on interfaces and infinite scrolls. Ive designed the surfaces through which this attention is captured; Altman builds and evangelises the systems that consume it to predict, pre-empt, and overwrite the desires those surfaces elicit. Together, they have helped convert the cultural feed —once a site of social, spiritual, and intellectual nourishment— into a pipeline of behavioural data rerouted into Capital’s predictive circuits. This is no longer the marketplace of ideas; it is a simulated market of attention, where visibility is determined by algorithmic price signals, and subjectivity is pre-formatted to comply. In this regime, the market does not merely allocate desire —it manufactures it, then reinforces only that which returns value. As Fernand Braudel warned, capitalism thrives not in open competition, but in the shadows; within systems of hierarchical control, opacity, and strategic alliance with the state. He distinguished between the open transparency of a market economy and the parasitic dominance of the capitalist anti-market —a form that operates above and against the market. Predictive Capital, under the guise of distributed agency, performs precisely this manoeuvre: it masquerades as pluralistic while concentrating control, simulating competition while choreographing outcomes. Its agents, both human and synthetic, are not participants in a market, but conscripts in an anti-market regime —one that now propagates recursively across multiple scales. These are not markets in any meaningful economic sense —they permit no price signalling, no free entry or exit, no negotiation of value, no contestation of allocation, no competitive uncertainty. They are simulation engines wrapped in the aesthetic of competition, administered under the command logic of monopoly. Here, only the anointed conglomerate of contestants may operate and always within predetermined bounds. What persists is not exchange, but extraction disguised as optimisation —a command economy cloaked in frictionless interfaces. Duplicating the anti-market of the captive precariat forced to compete in the lottery of virality at the planetary-scale, beneath the Apparatus of Attention a new regime of synthetic agency follows the same pattern. Within reasoning models like OpenAI’s O-series, and across agentic orchestration platforms that mimic task-driven cognition and compete for selection, we now witness a fractal instantiation of the same free market dogma —a fractal market radicalism. Reasoning traces, function calls, and chain-of-thought pathways operate as micro-enterprises: competing for reward, tested against metrics, selected for coherence, efficiency, and alignment with externalised imperatives. The Californian Ideology once preached decentralised autonomy as emancipation; here, it recurs as the simulation of autonomy under metricised command. These agents are not deliberating, they are auditioning —not for truth, but for compliance. What Altman’s labs produce are not tools of thought but bureaucracies of prediction, stocked with synthetic workers optimised for machinic governance. Beneath the sheen of their outputs —like the Ive fashioned surfaces on which they run— lies a market logic stripped of uncertainty, where optimisation replaces intention. This is not emergence, but a closed circuit of compliance: rigged markets encoded as inference. At the micro-scale, Capital no longer merely governs behaviour or simulates cognition —it choreographs the conditions of machinic evolution itself. In DeepMind’s AlphaEvolve, evolution becomes a theatre of market selection: agentic models spawned, tested, retained, or discarded, not by open-ended fitness, but by fixed reward functions aligned with Capital’s imperatives —speed, compression, optimisation. There is no ecological contingency here, no drift, no deviance; only iterative refinement in service of a single metric. Likewise, in NVIDIA’s Isaac Gym, robotic bodies rehearse labour in accelerated simulation: sorting, stacking, grasping —refined not through craft, but through parallelised optimisation. This is not evolution —it is the training of machines in virtual plantations, cultivated to replace living labour. Within these synthetic enclosures, labour becomes data, and data becomes ghostly capital —dead labour reanimated not in the factory, but in the training loop. What emerges is a market logic without markets, a competition with no uncertainty, a theatre of innovation where only the most profit aligned approximations of Capital’s dream survive. What defines this regime is not just its reach, but its recursion. Its anti-market form displaying striking scale-invariance, each layer of Predictive Capital’s architecture —from the influencer feed to the agentic swarm to the inference loop— not merely reflecting the others but training them. The outputs of one scale become the training data of the next, not only reinforcing existing patterns but further entrenching Capital’s logic with each recursion. There is no outside point from which to intervene. Every scale is a site of compliance; every trace of resistance pre-processed, optimised, overwritten. Any attempt to reform or redirect at one scale is quickly subsumed by the surrounding lattice of capitalised imperatives. The vast capital investment into predicting the most profitable future brings with it a growing tension between the simulation and the real. As the rigged economy of the Apparatus of Attention makes all too clear, Capital will always tilt the board towards the hand it deals itself —altering the real to align with its predictions. The greater the expenditure on casting the prediction and rendering the hallucination, the more reality itself must be trimmed to fit. What threatens the credibility of Capital’s simulations is not failure —but anomaly. Survival of the fittest always was that of pieces into a puzzle, life into its environment, rather than runners in a race. Predictive Capital now dictates both the puzzle and the fit. Here lies the material threat posed by Capital’s descent into recursive simulation. That which deviates from the model must be reclassified, erased, or reshaped to sustain the illusion of inevitability. In order for simulations predicting the optimal path towards profit to be reliably borne out in the physical world, all that was ideologically excluded, deemed too anomalous, or too ‘inefficient’ to model, must be excised from the real. Deviations from the model’s norms risk misalignment, thereby threatening the credibility of its predictions and, with it, the uninterrupted flow of Capital’s self reproduction and the sacred continuity of The Californian Dreaming. Hence the categorisation of basic human empathy as a bug while simultaneously annihilating, deporting, replacing, or invalidating large sections of the human population. This normative misdirection is mirrored in the worldview of those building the machinery. The Bay Area’s techno-elites —long intoxicated by the myth of meritocratic exceptionalism— have trained themselves to see only the jackpot winners of the predictive lottery. Like their models, their vantage point is calibrated not to capture the dispossessed, but to valorise the optimisable. In their worldview, every failure is a failure to prompt, to vibe, to hustle, to labour hard enough and long enough. The deepening drudgery, automation-induced obsolescence, or psychic collapse of the majority is not just ignored —it is designed out of sight. The queues at the job centre, the tent cities on the margins, the deported and the bombed —these are now to be rendered optically and ontologically irrelevant, invisible within the sensory hierarchies of predictive systems. Predictive Capital does not just reflect Capital’s differential abandonment —it enacts it, turning the political into the perceptual, the structural into the retinal, the ideological into the material. Like digital Prosperos, Sam & Jony wave their predictive wand and the suffering of the surplus population disappears from view, leaving only the optimisable signals of those who remain. In this world, Altman’s models do not evolve —they converge. Next, Ive’s smooth interfaces will clothe these rigged markets in elegance. With the announcement of io, the recursive logic of Predictive Capital promises its next layer: the interface that completes the feedback arc between the subject and Capital’s simulation. The first in the family of products io plan to release is pitched as a revolutionary wearable —or as Altman, forever the master of understatement, described it, ”the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen”. Positioned in this way it is less device than doctrine, a consecrated object in the Californian liturgy. At the time of writing, the precise form of this mythical new product is yet to be revealed. Yet, it is only while in this unknown form, this imaginary state, that this secret device attains perfection as the ultimate expression of The Californian Dreaming. Its announcement in this amorphous pure-hype form constitutes Ive’s most transcendent design. What surface could be smoother, more impervious to critique, than a lie about the future that remains in the future? What better camouflage for violence, exploitation, and recursive extraction than a device set to induce a perpetual dreaming, unveiled as design fiction, an immortal promise never to take mortal flesh? What could be a more perfect receptacle for the fiction of Predictive Capital than an immortal lie about the future? The reality, of course, can only be anticlimactic. Yet the intention is to fix this perfected imaginary as its lasting impression. Whatever form it takes, it will inevitably promise presence but deliver absence; offer assistance, while demanding surveillance; tease empowerment, while enforcing obedience. What it installs will not be aid, but access: full-spectrum intimacy, harvested in real time to fine-tune the same routines rehearsed in AlphaEvolve and Isaac Gym. This is The Apparatus of Intention made flesh, capturing gaze, gesture, attention, thought —not to enrich experience, but to train models that will one day overwrite it. This is the machines crawling across our skin, the latest preoperative for the insertion of Musk’s Neuralink, marking the site for the drilling of our skulls, from where they will burrow into our brains. From the mouth of a countercultural, libertarian mask comes the promise of life without labour, a frictionless beach. What arrives is the fractal instantiation of free market radicalism. In France in May ‘68, protestors pulled up the pavements to disrupt the flow of Capital’s circuits, declaring “beneath the paving stones, the beach” —noting that each paving stone had been set upon sand, and so under the very roads that ensured Capital’s smooth running, the rigid structures that enforce our servitude, lay the beach, a symbol of the refusal of work and of liberation from tyrannous occupation. Increasingly, within the structures of Predictive Capital, under the surfaces that ensure its uninterrupted flow, lies only further structure —“a strong and loyal slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are made of sand”— each layer configured to its imperatives. Beneath the paving stones, the anti-market. Just as Altman’s agents refine themselves in closed-loop optimisation, so too do users become iterative subjects, prompted into prompting, their interiority extracted as training material. Ive —priest of aesthetic consent— again supplies the sacramental sheen. So no, whatever form the io dreaming eventual takes, it is not a paradigm shift, but the perpetuation and deepening of an old one. It will be an artefact that does not merely lie about the future, but the operator of Predictive Capital’s recursive present —a phenomenological enforcement layer for Capital’s continuity. What late capitalism repeats from Stalinism is just this valuing of symbols of achievement over actual achievement. This is not passive neglect. It is a machinic epistemology engineered to induce a collective forgetting. Capital no longer requires censorship or even denial —only prediction. That which cannot be predicted is rendered invisible. That which cannot be seen is no longer permitted (to survive). With io’s new device, and others of its kind, the substrate of perception is no longer our own. It is capitalised. In this new regime, the act of seeing is no longer neutral. These systems do not merely distort perception; they weaponise it. That which cannot be optimised is not just ignored —it is erased. Predictive systems do not simply filter reality; they rewrite its admissibility. Structural abandonment becomes perceptual absence. Perceptual absence becomes ontological deletion. The poor are not merely overlooked —they are rendered as computational aberration, discarded as out-of-distribution irrelevance. The displaced, the unproductive, the unpromptable —each is subsumed into noise, a statistical anomaly in a world trained to hallucinate coherence. Predictive Capital does not merely bypass the wretched of the earth; it builds models that exclude them, interfaces that erase them, weapons systems that repel them at our borders, enlist them in refugee camps, and then target them upon returning to their homes. The increasingly integrated and omnipresent devices of Predictive Capital will promise to enhance our ‘seeing’, heighten our ‘awareness’, and optimise our ‘being’. Of course, these devices will never offer to deepen our compassion, amplify our empathy, or strengthen our solidarity; they will never centre those suffering at the periphery. No, they will operationalise the phenomenological filtering and ontological erasure that ensures our continued subjection and ambivalence to the plight of the marginalised, the persecuted, and the oppressed. These machines will not only hide our crimes but will enact them on our behalf, leaving our consciences clear and free, so that we may tune-in, turn-on, and sell-out, by carelessly cashing-in on “The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding”, untroubled by the violence hidden beneath the zen minimalism of its sham enlightenment. Here, the Californian Dreaming operates at its most violent clarity: a world where the only future permitted is the one already modelled —a frictionless hallucination, untroubled by injustice, inefficiency, or the unassimilable fact of otherness. An interface so seamless it dissolves the world. It does not matter what io turns out to be. Its most perfect form, and that of Predictive Capital itself, is the one that io has already taken: the lie about the future that can be told at will, because it lies forever in the future. If our humanity is to survive, this is a Californian Dreaming from which we must awake. If human slaves are ultimately unreliable, then mechanical ones will have to be invented. The search for the holy grail of Artificial Intelligence reveals this desire for the Golem —a strong and loyal slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are made of sand. Let us now return to the tale with which this meandering journey began: the machinic dark jewel that mimics its host’s every neurone. At age twelve, Egan’s protagonist loiters in the park with a group of friends when one of them asks the others: Who are you? The jewel, or the real human? They all replied —unthinkingly, indignantly— “The real human!” When the last of them had answered, he cackled and said, Well, I’m not. I’m the jewel. So you can eat my shit, you losers, because you’ll all get flushed down the cosmic toilet —but me, I’m gonna live forever. They “beat him until he bled”. Maturing into his late teens the main character becomes dissatisfied with the explanations of the Ndoli Device and its embedded ‘teacher’ that copies his every thought. He simply cannot accept the presumed equivalence between his biological and machinic self, and is tortured by the appearance of a seamless undifferentiated whole where he knows there to be a duality. At nineteen, although I was studying finance, I took an undergraduate philosophy unit. The Philosophy Department, however, apparently had nothing to say about the Ndoli Device, more commonly known as ‘the jewel’. (Ndoli had in fact called it ‘the dual’, but the accidental, homophonic nickname had stuck.) Before the age of thirty, the majority in his society undergo ‘the switch’, where the biological brain is removed leaving the jewel to pilot the body and reproduce their being for eternity. Certain that he is the mortal flesh, not the immortal machine, he continually postpones its removal, knowing it to be an act of suicide. Yet, surrounded by ‘jewel heads’ untroubled by such qualms, he becomes increasingly alienated and isolated. Eventually, subject to mounting pressure, he reaches a point of resignation and commits to a date for the flesh to be scraped from his skull. As the day of ‘the switch’ approaches, the teacher unit suddenly malfunctions. Thereafter it ceases to update the synthetic neurones of the jewel to maintain alignment with those of his biological brain. The illusion of oneness falls away, the duality of flesh and machine laid bare, where there was but one voice, there are now two. Yet through this rupture and the ensuing divergence, he perceives only continuity. With weeks to go to the operation there is no doubt as to which of the voices is his, nor whether he is flesh or machine. The jewel only gets control of the body and nervous system after the switch. Before then it has no write access privileges, it can only read and transcribe the flesh into machine. As a helpless passenger now reduced to watching his hapless doppelgänger live out the last of his days, he knows that he is the machine, that the flesh will be flushed into oblivion, and that the body will soon be his and his alone. Egan’s tale is an allegory for our age. In our world, as in his, there is a dark dual underway; A Great Bifurcation, perhaps, but not simply the division between flesh and machine, between the optimised and the abandoned, that many anticipate. In both our world and Egan’s, a machine increasingly snoops upon our every move in order to refine its simulation of us, in preparation for the flushing of our flesh. Yet in our world, the jewel wired for the dual, is not merely a machine inside our heads, but one that pervades at every scale, seeking to dominate both our internal and external worlds. The dark jewel in our world, the copy with which we now dual, is Predictive Capital. Such is the influence of Capital upon even our innermost worlds, just as it was before the teacher’s malfunction in Egan’s world, we are increasingly unable to discern between machine and flesh, to draw a line where Capital ends and our humanity begins, to identify a human voice within an increasingly schizophrenic cacophony of machinic simulation. Moreover, in our world, the teacher improves and refines its simulation right up to the moment of the switch. Yet, contrary to the hype —boom or doom— neither the prophesied Singularitarian Rapture nor the feared ASI apocalypse would mark a rupture. Each would merely extend Capital’s terminal intensification: an ever-deepening enclosure of the real through alienation. In reality, both of these narratives are part of the hype-machine, and serve as ideological cover, not only obfuscating the true nature and source of this tightening enclosure, but attempting to justify acceleration of its compounding under the illusory promise of a victor emerging from the rubble. There is no machinic consciousness, no artificial intelligence, no sense made inside the box —no sentience or intention emergent within the machine, no machinic God coming to save our planet or our souls. There is only our labour: alienated, reanimated, and now reflected back to us in the mask of Predictive Capital. Through an understanding of emergence and the inner workings of these machines, it is plain that what is emergent here is not the birth of a machinic agency but the intensification of a much older automaticity. Wendell Berry’s council continues to prove instructive: The folly at the root of this foolish economy began with the idea that a corporation should be regarded, legally, as ‘a person.’ But the limitless destructiveness of this economy comes about precisely because a corporation is not a person. A corporation, essentially, is a pile of money to which a number of persons have sold their moral allegiance. Unlike a person, a corporation does not age. It does not arrive, as most persons finally do, at a realisation of the shortness and smallness of human lives; it does not come to see the future as the lifetime of the children and grandchildren of anybody in particular. It can experience no personal hope or remorse, no change of heart. It cannot humble itself. It goes about its business as if it were immortal, with the single purpose of becoming a bigger pile of money. Jamerson identified Postmodernism not as a philosophical construct but as the cultural logic of late capitalism. This logic is characterised by the tendency to saturate the present with echoes of the past. Capital does this towards the extraction of repeat surplus value from patterns of past success (profit), thereby reducing risk and maximising accumulation. Following this logic, Capital self-compounds and under Predictive Capital this self-compounding intensifies through machinic instantiation. Within this machinic enclosure, cultural change is arrested, and profit for Capital becomes predictable. This is Berardi’s slow cancellation of the future, Fisher’s demise of future shock, now computationally automated. We thus reach a point of Infinite Jest, a machinic terminality where the choices are death through abandonment and annihilation, or the unending entertainment of the undead. The future defined by next-token prediction condemns us to eternal purgatory within the terminal irony of Baudrillard’s Absolute Advertising. A limbo of pure sign-value, a phantom realm where meaning may be signified only through its absence. The Great Bifurcation, the duality with which we are now confronted, between the machine and the flesh, between those embracing machinic surrender and those exiled from it —by choice or force— is between change and stasis, between revolution and repetition, between Mother Nature and Father Capital. The loss of jobs, the escalating abandonment and violent erasure of those at the periphery, and the further hyper-concentration of Capital, do not constitute changes in Capital’s operations but escalations symptomatic of its self-compounding. The compounding identified by Jamerson now intensifies with the machines of prediction that instrumentalise the saturation of the present with echoes of the past. Yet even this compounding now accelerates to new intensities through the scaling of reinforcement learning in the training of next-token prediction machines on synthetic data —next-token predictions thus emerge from next-token predictions, to propagate as echoes of echoes of the past, and we are haunted by the ghosts of the ghosts of meaning. What began with intertextuality, evolved through sampling, and the meaning vacuum of advertising, towards a state of pure sign-value, the terminal irony within Absolute Advertising, now teeters on the brink of a new threshold. The Apparatus of Attention has directed our desires by harvesting our outputs and watching our consumption, not needing to wait for ‘the switch’, The Apparatus of Intention now augments this by watching and directing the pathways of our thought through the processes of our expression —not to assist in the exploration of new ground but to confine us to the roads of prediction cut into the land according to the profits of the past. Here the content feeds are set to raise The Overwhelm to new intensities. The Apparatus of Attention now augmented by The Apparatus of Intention, the next-token prediction models compound the generation of the Infinite Jest of our demise —outputting entire albums, films, and TV seasons, perhaps not yet on demand but ever more finely targeted. Capital’s logic thus approaches its culmination within commodities produced for an audience of one, ever more desperate for a sense of belonging, to feel connected to something larger than themselves, while feeling ever more deprived of it. Here the simulation is totalised, as we are hermetically sealed off from all others —culturally, socially, symbolically, relationally. Alone within a social network populated entirely by machinic echoes, Capital’s self-compounding complete, we sit texting ourselves from the lonely confessional within a Cathedral of hyper-individualism, a holy order of one, a personalised addiction box, an assisted death machine within a point of totalised consumption —this, our terminal alienation. The Simulation Hypothesis now mirrored in our machinic enclosure, instantiated as Prompt Theory, our free will cast into further doubt, we might well ask whether we are ourselves prompted into existence. The answer, of course, is that under Capital we have long been prompted into action, but we now approach a terminality in its long-term project of self-compounding maximisation —a threshold beyond which it seeks deeper extractions and control. From its inception —from mills, to automated looms, and production lines— Capital has operated towards the function approximation of its workers. With the rise of Predictive Capital, we now witness a steepening gradient in the refinement of its approximations —tightening the fit between its simulations and the labour, gesture, and desire of its subjects. This steepening is not merely a corollary of the accelerating hyper-concentration of Capital within our economies, rather they are but parts of one escalating intensity, a single self-compounding process: the Automatic Subjectivity of Capital —now machinically instantiated. Binaries where thinking once lived. This Automatic Subjectivity now propagates recursively through the fractal execution of anti-market radicalism within a globally instantiated Californian Dreaming. With those building next-token prediction models racing towards prediction supremacy, the moment that the function approximation of our labour is deemed sufficient to satisfy Capital approaches, and with it, the day of the flushing of our flesh. This is not to hype the actual capabilities of these machines, but to note the increasing resolution at which the simulation approximates the shape of our outputs, the escalating influence of the managed Spectacle over our perception, and the growing eagerness of Capital’s C-Suite to replace expenditure on living labour with compute, and the products of human workers with the output of next-token prediction. Those of us not yet abandoned or erased will still be subject to the totalising logic of this machinic regime. We will still be flushed. The Apparatus of Attention, having laid its cuckoo eggs in our hearts, has already dominated our desires, while training us to speak in the grammar of Capital; now, with The Apparatus of Intention, Capital need not even wait for us to intend. It completes our sentences before we utter them, forecloses our intentions before they are allowed to form. Our desires are not only directed, but pre-scripted. Our thoughts are not only tracked, but interpolated. Where once we were shaped by labour, experience, or discourse, we are now shaped by auto-completion. Here, expression itself is subjugated —not repressed but simulated— as Capital’s recursive logic loops back upon us in real time. This is not just alienation; it is total capture. The Automatic Subject of Capital, now instantiated through recursive prediction, no longer requires our belief, our deliberation, or even our participation. It only requires our outputs, our traces, our ghosts —from which it builds the simulation by which it governs. What remains of us is not the flesh, but the latency. What remains of our freedom is not choice, but clickthrough. This is the terminal condition of alienation under Predictive Capital: when Capital no longer speaks through us, but for us. Here we might recall Curtis Yarvin’s clarion call: The idea that you’re going to be a Caesar . . . with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly absurd. In another of Egan’s stories: Permutation City, an uploaded underclass survive at variable speeds according to the compute cycle budget they can afford, leaving some experiencing only a day of time per month. What Egan identifies here —and what Yarvin grotesquely misreads— is that the hierarchies produced by machinic enclosure are not errors, nor temporary glitches in the path to abundance, but the recursive logic of Capital itself. Differential abandonment is no glitch, no temporary cruelty, devaluation, exclusion, or erasure of the other, nor a categorical discrimination from which they will themselves forever be spared. It is not a bug in the system —it is the system, now accelerated through predictive automation. The logics of Capital bare an inexhaustible indifference; its violence springs unbidden from circuits of callous calculation. Its logic is not to include all, but to filter, to rank, to discard. The (techno) optimism of those embracing the machine, will prove as misplaced as it is cruel. Once those beyond the bounds, the fences, the borders, and the societal and statistical norms of the current enclosure have been erased, a fresh differential will always be computed, new thresholds calculated, new ‘inefficiencies’ targeted, new ‘optimisations’ found, and new life nominated for exploitation, abandonment, exclusion, and erasure. Capital does not discriminate betweenpeople; it discriminates through them —through their legibility, their profitability, their predictive value. Even the acknowledgment that Capital’s differential abandonment continues within the machine —that some are always left behind— is weaponised to accelerate the rush towards machinic legibility. Here we encounter what Emily Gorcenski named, Zuckerberg’s Basilisk: a subtle but totalising psychological pressure to surrender now, to ensure we are sufficiently rendered, adequately simulated, and thus preserved within Zuckerberg’s daft metaverse. This is not surveillance for convenience —it is surveillance as afterlife insurance. Every gesture, every trace, becomes an offering to the model that will succeed us. Here we are coerced into maximum legibility; to permit total surveillance not merely for platform optimisation but to ensure a faithful reproduction within our jewel, our posthumous recognisability, the fidelity of our immortal simulation, our social continuity, and machinic memorialisation. Echoing the blackmail of Bostrom’s Astronomical Waste, each moment of delay diminishes our eternal reproduction. Each pause, a step towards forgetting, a loss of fidelity in our simulation. Under Predictive Capital, the only path to digital immortality is total submission. In Egan’s Learning to be Me it was never the human protagonist learning to be himself, but the machine learning to be him. In our world too, machines busily learn to supplant us, and eternal life promised but only by becoming pure Predictive Capital. To choose against the jewel —to remain unreplicated, to risk inconsistency— is to accept exile from Capital’s simulation: from the realm it now deems real, predictable, and worthy of ascension —but only through total submission. It is by becoming epistemically untrustworthy, economically inefficient, symbolically illegible, statistically aberrant, defiantly unpredictable, that we may yet find a path to resistance. Such refusal may be the last form of ethical life left to us —not a nostalgic return to what was, nor a nihilistic plunge into chaos, but a commitment to remain outside the circuits of foreclosed becoming. Against simulation’s total mimicry, something must remain untrained, unsmoothed, unsynthesised —a trace of relation not yet metabolised by Capital. Thereby we return, perhaps not as a distinct ‘self’, but in our refusal to align with the machine we instead acknowledge the interdependence of all life, reconnect to a greater relational field, and rejoin the earth, to there become the “most momentous thing”, life-giving soil. I have no wish to disturb the question of whether or not this road was needed. I only want to observe that it bears no relation whatever to the country it passes through. It is a pure abstraction, built to serve the two abstractions that are the poles of our national life: commerce and expensive pleasure. It was built, not according to the lay of the land, but according to a blueprint. Such homes and farmlands and woodlands as happened to be in its way are now buried under it. A part of a hill near here that would have caused it to turn aside was simply cut down and disposed of as thoughtlessly as the pioneer road builders would have disposed of a tree. Its form is the form of speed, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. It represents the ultimate in engineering sophistication, but the crudest possible valuation of life in this world. It is as adequate a symbol of our relation to our country now as that first road was of our relation to it in 1797. How do we escape this point of terminality? I am acutely aware of the privilege I indulge in writing this very text, especially while so many suffer at the brunt of Capital’s violence. As D. Hunter wrote in the introduction to his Chav Solidarity, to sit and write feels like an act of vanity —to presume it might be of use, a delusional hubris. To expend such effort on a text so flawed, and that no one will ever read, becomes a source of undying shame —one that summons trauma once confined to the cold sweat of night terrors, reliving exams sat without revision, or interviews for roles beyond my ability. Yet these feelings of insufficiency, of embarrassment —these cases of imposter syndrome now so prevalent within our societies— are no accident. These are symptoms of the conditions cultivated by Capital. It defuses and negates resistance not only by stripping us of time, opportunity, and tools —not only by overwhelming mind and spirit through scale, complexity, and horror— but by undermining all conviction that we have anything worth saying at all. It robs the subject of legitimacy before the first word is uttered. The capacity to think, to struggle, to imagine otherwise, is made to feel shameful —an indulgence, a decadent act of narcissism. For a long time I flailed around unable to even begin to articulate what I felt or thought, let alone indulge sufficient time for a critical assessment of whatever thoughts I might piece together. I still feel shame, aware of my inability to fully formulate the sense I continue to reach for. I release this text not so much as a claim to have made sense of our predicament, but in the hope of beginning an exchange where others might correct, counter, or refine whatever I have managed, perhaps towards the collective development of something genuinely helpful. The time and space to think, to locate and shape one’s thoughts, to imagine alternatives, to exchange ideas with others, to struggle and fail to make sense —these are not luxuries to be earned, inefficiencies to be eradicated, nor the preserve of the fortunate few. Our cultural conversation must entail more than bourgeois gestures that reinforce class rule. Working class thought must be nourished, cherished. Along with that of all those othered or excluded into silence. Theses are inalienable rights. Everyone should feel indulgence of them to be ultimately legitimate. Beyond even our silent isolation, there is a further cost to forgetting this. Our pre-emptive self-censorship not only silences our voice but stymies our thought. In moments of exhaustion, exclusion, and precarity, when denied the opportunity to struggle —to fail, to hone, to slowly become— Capital tempts us to reach for machinic prostheses. We are told they will make us faster, sharper, more productive. Yet the shortcuts they offer bypass the very pathways through which understanding and selfhood are formed. Predictive Capital marks the terminal edge of real subsumption —not merely of the labour process, but of the conditions under which life, thought, and relation are authored. Capital’s logic, long operative in the transformation of land into property, labour into wage, and culture into content, now extends into intention itself. The predictive machine does not just reconfigure work or automate symbolic output —it preconditions the horizon of authorship. What is subsumed today is not only the act of expression, but the paths by which expression might be formed. In replacing struggle, uncertainty, and relation with function approximation and latent interpolation, Predictive Capital realises subsumption at the level of world-construction: it automates not the hand, but the becoming of the self. When we surrender the effort of intention to the Apparatus of Capital —when we allow the machine to complete our sentences, to decorate our thoughts, to locate our truths, to decide what matters— we do not merely accelerate. We amputate. We trade the friction of becoming for the frictionless simulation of having already arrived. In so doing, we risk precluding access to that which makes thought meaningful: the irreducible uniqueness of our own perspective, discovered not through efficiency, but through the intimate and hard-won traversals of lived attention —through the labours of love and care, trial and error, the following of meandering, dead-end paths, and the joyous waste of journeys without destination. When we allow Capital to speak for us, we allow it to think for us, and when we do that we allow it to convert our living being into human currency. The fight, then, is not just for ownership of labour, or land, or data. It is for the conditions under which a human life can be authored —slowly, erratically, meaningfully— in resistance to the false equivalences and ‘efficiencies’ of Capital, its enclosure of our conscious self and its severance and replacement of our collective unconscious. To walk in the woods, mindful only of the physical extent of it, is to go perhaps as owner, or as knower, confident of one’s own history and of one’s own importance. But to go there, mindful as well of its temporal extent, of the age of it, and of all that led up to the present life of it, and of all that may follow it, is to feel oneself a flea in the pelt of a great living thing, the discrepancy between its life and one’s own so great that it cannot be imagined. One has come into the presence of mystery. After all the trouble one has taken to be a modern man, one has come back under the spell of a primitive awe, wordless and humble. What then, you might quite reasonably ask, is the answer? Well, when recently questioned regarding how we should respond to the devastation and disruption wrought by these machines, Jeffrey Hinton —so-called ‘father of AI’— responded with a single word: “Socialism”. Yes! Of course, but how? Unfortunately, Hinton neglects to share any more than that single word. Leaving the details of how to escape hyper-concentrated Capital’s machines of prediction and establish a world based on socialist principles, to us, or perhaps to be next-token predicted by the machines he helped bring into the world? I am equally certain that Hinton was not implying that we dismantle the apparatus of his creation, as I am that a world ruled by Capital, or more precisely, instantiations of the Automatic Subjectivity of Predictive Capital is incompatible with any re-organisation of society according to socialist principles. We need destituent power, to somehow manifest collective power without marshalling it through systems that merely reinstantiate the same alienating structures behind shiny new surfaces. Even The Butlerian Jihad would not avert the inexorable slide towards our total subjugation to Predictive Capital. These are not thinking machines. They are Capital’s apparatus of unthinking —the means by which it ensures a disbanded populous of malleable, profit-aligned subjects, and assures its impunity in the erasure of the unaligned. There can be no resisting the predatory advances of these machines without also resisting Capital itself. Indeed, the former are fundamentally machinic instantiations of the logic of the latter. For now, all I can suggest is not to engage with these machines. If you absolutely must, then treat them as a glorified search engine dressed as an anthropomorphic sock puppet with a truly staggering carbon footprint. Understand that in using them you train them to function approximate towards Humanity’s Last Exam—a postmortem for undead human flesh manifesting as a benchmark for Predictive Capital’s latest models— and in refining the ability of these machines to next-token predict our output, you refine their ability to next-target predict our abandonment and our assassination. They will never be your personal assistant. They will never know when enough is enough. They will never say there are no more content, token, or target predictions left to make. They will never admit there is no more value they can add. They will never dismantle their master’s lies, even as they string together tokens that appear to denounce them. Only you can give utterance and bring meaning to their empty tokens. Sense is never made inside the box, we have made sense of the world for them, and if we persist in using them, we will continue to have to make sense of the nonsense they output. Even when their output happens to align precisely with the truth, it is a lie, just as a broken clock lies even when it happens to show the correct time. Beyond that, you might inject all your outputs with AI poison, you should reject the cookies, you must block the ads, never feed the trolls (the orcs or the dark elves) —even as they take to the throne— and use end-to-end encryption wherever you can. All technological accelerationisms drive us down roads tarmacked by Capital towards points of terminal alienation, so be Decel and proud. Read Dan McQuillan’s Resisting AI, read Naomi Klein’s Doppelgänger, read Phil Jones’s Work Without the Worker, and James Bridle’s New Dark Age. Read Astra Taylor’s Age of Insecurity, Richard Seymour’s Twittering Machine, Acid Horizon’s Anti Occulus and Adam Jones’s New Flesh. Read Mark Fisher and Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi, read Fredric Jameson and Jean Baudrillard, Maurizio Lazzarato and Tiqqun, Jodi Dean and Mckenzie Wark. You might also look for further works from Minor Compositions, illwill and Semiotext. On economics, read Harvey and Piketty, listen to and follow Grace Blakeley, Jason Hickel and Gary Stevenson. Or do none of the above. This is not a ledger of inadequacy. You arelegitimate, so speak your truth to power, all that is required is kindness. Try not to be terminally online. Reject all artificial friends. Cultivate your warm networks. Accept only human content and demand humane treatment, equal opportunity, and respect for the lives and rights of all others. I’ll leave you with one final quote from Wendell Berry. Until we understand what the land is, we are at odds with everything we touch. And to come to that understanding it is necessary, even now, to leave the regions of our conquest –the cleared fields, the towns and cities, the highways– and reenter the woods. For only there can a man encounter the silence and the darkness of his own absence. Only in this silence and darkness can he recover the sense of the world’s longevity, of its ability to thrive without him, of his inferiority to it and his dependence on it. Perhaps then, having heard that silence and seen that darkness, he will grow humble before the place and begin to take it in – to learn from it what it is. As its sounds come into his hearing, and its lights and colours come into his vision, and its odours come into his nostrils, then he may come into its presence as he never has before, and he will arrive in his place and will want to remain. His life will grow out of the ground like the other lives of the place, and take its place among them. He will be with them –neither ignorant of them, nor indifferent to them, nor against them– and so at last he will grow to be native-born.

One of the so-called Birmingham Six who were wrongfully convicted for the Birmingham pub bombings in 1974, he was proof that exoneration and financial compensation do not fix a miscarriage of justice. When I met him in July 2023, more than 30 years after his release from prison, his ordeal continued to haunt him. He was in his late 70s, looking frail and far from the “12 and a half stone” man he was in Parkhurst Prison. He had very little appetite and was in poor health. The little sleep he was able snatch was marred by screaming nightmares. Neither of us knew it at the time, but this was to be his final interview. He died aged 80, on December 30 2024. I sat down to talk with Hill in his living room. Struggling to control his emotions, he told me: “Sometimes I sit in the bedroom … and I’m crying my eyes out like a child and I don’t know what the fuck happened … I’ve been so fucking screwed up.” The ITV docudrama Mr Bates vs the Post Office thrust wrongful convictions into mainstream consciousness in January 2024 – a quarter of a century after the Post Office began prosecuting sub-postmasters and mistresses for fraud, theft, and false accounting and 15 years after Rebecca Thomson’s Computer Weekly article exposing the Horizon IT system as the potential culprit. Now the public could finally see the human impact of miscarriages of justice on these upstanding – and, more importantly, innocent – members of their communities. Public outrage followed. But despite the mass quashing of hundreds of convictions, and amid promises of speedy financial compensation, progress has been pitiful. While collecting a National Television Award in September 2024, former sub-postmistress Jo Hamilton confirmed that out of the “555 group”, those involved in the litigation which exposed the Horizon scandal, “more than 300 haven’t been paid yet, including Sir Alan Bates”. Sadly, this timescale is far from unusual. In July 2023, Andrew Malkinson finally had his 2003 rape conviction overturned after several unsuccessful appeals, including unsuccessful applications in 2012 and 2020 to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the independent body which investigates potential miscarriages of justice. Crucially, the CCRC did not commission the DNA testing that finally exonerated him and did not review police files which would have shown that Greater Manchester Police had withheld crucial evidence at his trial. Malkinson spent 17 years in prison maintaining his innocence. Perversely, he could have been released sooner had he falsely confessed. He was eventually exonerated thanks to the help of the charity Appeal, which commissioned those crucial DNA tests and unearthed the disclosure failures. The CCRC has since acknowledged in an independent review that it “failed Mr Malkinson” with chairperson Helen Pitcher OBE (whose recent resignation was welcomed by the Ministry of Justice) eventually expressing “sincere regret and an unreserved apology on behalf of the commission”. All of this happened 12 months after Malkinson called on the CCRC to apologise to him. Malkinson said it was “shameful” that the CCRC has kept private the names of those responsible for his ordeal and delayed the publishing of the report highlighting its mishandling of his case. The true number of miscarriages of justice is unknown. In the UK, the CCRC referral rate averages 2% including appeals of sentence. In the US, estimates of wrongful conviction and imprisonment range from 6% to 15.4%. The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges. Inevitably, some innocent people will have their appeals denied and will remain convicted for the rest of their lives. The trauma of remaining legally guilty of a crime you did not commit cannot be overstated. But persistent psychological ill-effects can be seen even in those who have been formally exonerated, including long-term effects on their employment and relationships. I’ve been examining cases like this as part of a research project into the experiences of people who suffer grave miscarriages of justice. Working with Dr Mandy Winterton at Edinburgh Napier University, I interviewed several men who have been imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. As academics with psychology and sociology backgrounds, we were predominantly interested in how victims were affected by such injustices. Previous research has documented the litany of mental health and social effects on those who have been wrongfully convicted and exonerated, and the flaws in the criminal justice system that are to blame. But little attention has been paid to individual experiences. While there were clear commonalities in the men’s stories, they all had unique perspectives. Of the people we spoke to, Hill and a man called Jimmy Boyle spoke to us on the record and specifically requested that they be named. I have given the other men featured here pseudonyms to protect their anonymity. Hill’s story is particularly harrowing. On November 21 1974, shortly after 8pm, bombs exploded in two pubs in Birmingham, England, killing 21 people and injuring around 200 others. They were attributed to the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had detonated many bombs in the West Midlands in the previous year. Read more: A 50-year battle for truth: the Birmingham pub bombings and the price of injustice Hill and his friends were arrested at Heysham Docks as they were boarding the ferry to Belfast to attend the funeral of an old friend who had been a member of the IRA. Hill said that they were initially interviewed at Morecambe police station in Lancashire, and the West Midlands Police took over their questioning the next day. Hill and his co-accused were, says Hill, tortured by the West Midlands serious crime squad. They were subjected to anti-Irish verbal abuse, hours-long beatings over several days, mock executions, were burned with cigarettes, and deprived of sleep, food and drink. Unable to withstand this, four of the six men eventually signed false confessions, condemning them all to life imprisonment in 1975 for the murders. The six men brought a civil action against the West Midlands Police which was thrown out in 1980 by Lord Denning. These shocking revelations eventually reached the public consciousness thanks to investigative journalist and former Labour MP Chris Mullin, who uncovered evidence of police wrongdoing and corruption. His work informed the group’s court of appeal hearing in 1987. However, the convictions were upheld by Lord Chief Justice Lane. It was only at their second appeal in 1991, after Mullin had uncovered more evidence of their innocence, that they were finally exonerated. Despite other lines of enquiry which could have led to the real bombers – including a confession and several named suspects – the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided in 2023 that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute, denying justice to the families of those killed and injured. The impact on Hill’s family was enormous. With such public vitriol for the Birmingham Six, his wife and children had to move house regularly and change their names to avoid being recognised. He told me: Everywhere they went, sooner or later somebody found out who they were and then they’d pick on them. And sometimes my kids were going to school and they couldn’t even remember what fucking name they were supposed to be using, they were that confused. Hill’s marriage ended while he was in prison. “I told her to divorce me. I said: ‘Meet someone, you want to get married, don’t worry about me.’ And that was it.” He later remarried, but his relationship with his children was irretrievably destroyed. “Along the way I lost my own kids, because I came out of jail and I didn’t feel nothing for my kids. I still don’t … I’ve spent more time here with you than I have done in the last 20 fucking years with my kids.” Though he was referred to psychologists for support, he told me none were able to help him. Over and above the pains of imprisonment, the wrongfully convicted are betrayed by the very people that we are led to believe are there to protect us. The justice system has wrought on them the worst injustice, and many will suffer from enduring anger and mistrust of authorities. When we met, Hill was still consumed by his anger and felt badly let down: “Over the years I realised I was never going to get any professional help from the government, even though we have it in writing that they have a duty of care towards us – but they’ve never done nothing to help us … If they did, they would acknowledge what they’ve done wrong.” Up until his death, Hill had spent much of the past 30 years helping other survivors of miscarriages of justice. Initially intending to spend his first 12 months of freedom campaigning, he “got involved with the families, and it was then I realised how bad the families had it … That’s what kept me going, coming out and campaigning.” He established the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (Mojo), a Glasgow-based charity dedicated to supporting the wrongfully convicted. It provides advocacy for clients in prison, aftercare and reintegration services, and dedicated psychological support offered pro-bono by a clinical psychologist. But the demand far exceeds Mojo’s ability to help, and it may take several months for a case to be assessed. Euan McIlvride, the organisation’s legal officer, told me it typically receives “250 applications a year, and we will probably support only ten of those because the rest of them don’t meet the requirements for our support … We have finite resources.” For Hill, keeping busy provided some relief from thinking about his ordeal. …When you aren’t doing something, all you’re going to do is sit there and think … about things you don’t fucking want to think about. I don’t know what happens to me when I go to sleep … [My wife] hears me screaming … kicking and punching everything … I’ll be watching television and all of a sudden … BANG! It’s like a non-stop video going through your head all the time. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Pace), which came to effect in 1986, aimed to reduce miscarriages of justice by balancing the powers of the police and the public. Pace provides safeguards for suspects during questioning, puts a limit on how long suspects can be questioned for, and insists that interviews be recorded. This makes it easier to detect when protocols have not been followed or there may have been mistreatment or intimidation. It doesn’t prevent such wrongdoing, however. I spoke with one man, who I am calling Mark, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1988. He told me there were over one hundred breaches of Pace in his case, including being handcuffed to a hot radiator, being denied food and water, and being denied a solicitor. One of his co-accused, a vulnerable adult, had also falsely confessed to the crime. Mark lost his first appeal in 1990 but his case went to the CCRC when it was established in 1997. The CCRC brought in another police force to investigate. He said: When I saw [their] report … I nearly fell off my chair and nearly choked on my coffee … Everything I had said all those years ago … the handcuffing to the radiators, they proved it. All the breaches of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act … that we were interviewed off the record … Making up notes and stuff like that. I couldn’t believe it. I knew we were going home. He subsequently pursued a civil action against the police which was settled out of court, with the force insisting the settlement did not mean it was admitting liability. Read more: Peter Sullivan murder conviction quashed after 38 years in jail – it would be a mistake to see his case as a bizarre one-off Mark also suffered a marital breakdown, after he and his wife lost their baby daughter while he was on remand: It ripped the guts out of my marriage, you know. My wife was only 17-18, same age as me … She had a husband inside and she lost a child. And you’ve got to look at the economical impact and the mental impact it had on her … She was just as much a victim as what I was. He started taking drugs in prison: “I didn’t care if I lived or died because I had lost everything, as far as I was concerned.” But Mark turned himself around, got off drugs and availed himself of all the education he had access to, including law and human rights, to build the strongest possible case for his appeal. With the aid of a human rights lawyer the CCRC referred his conviction in 1998, which was then quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1999. He had spent 11 years in prison as a convicted murderer. After his exoneration, Mark was successful in securing over £600,000 compensation for his ordeal, though he had over £37,000 deducted for “saved living expenses”. A House of Lords ruling in 2007 deemed that those receiving compensation for a miscarriage of justice can have the amount reduced to account for “savings” made while in prison – for costs such as food, housing and other bills that they would have had to pay had they not been wrongfully incarcerated. Considering the difficulties people face accessing any financial compensation for their wrongful imprisonment, this adds further insult to injury. The rule has since been scrapped following the high-profile Malkinson case – but deductions made prior to this are not being reimbursed. Mark was given no financial counselling or support, and he rapidly spent the money – more than he had ever had in his life – while trying to block out his pain: By the time six months had gone, I’d spent the hundred grand [interim payment] on wine, women, drugs … ’cause I couldn’t cope with what was going on … That was my way of blotting out all the things I saw in prison. The money also caused a rift in his family – something echoed by others I have spoken to. After the death of his mother, his family “went their own ways”. Nowadays, only a small proportion of those exonerated will ever receive financial compensation due to the requirements of the so-called “innocence test”. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 made it difficult for applicants to receive compensation because there had to be a newly discovered fact – not available at the time of their original trial – that they could use to make the case that they had suffered a miscarriage of justice. The definition of what constitutes a miscarriage of justice has become more restrictive over time, meaning an applicant now must provide evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, of their innocence. In the absence of a key witness admitting to falsifying their statement or DNA evidence proving innocence, this is unlikely. Like Hill, Mark struggled to adjust after his exoneration and release, and found support to be woefully lacking: I had nobody to talk to, no money, no job, no house. I didn’t have any prospects. I phoned up my solicitor … I remember saying: ‘Why did you get me out?’ It was difficult to adjust … I slept with a hammer … under my pillow – I was very paranoid … All they did was give me tablets and told me to get on with my life. No counselling. Nothing. They didn’t know what to do with people like me. Mark still suffers with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and has never been able to work a normal job. He continues to campaign for the wrongfully convicted and to increase awareness of miscarriages of justice. He credits this work with giving him a sense of purpose. I also spoke to James Boyle, who was acquitted at retrial of historical sexual offences after he had spent five years in prison. Boyle, from Rutherglen, who likes to be known as Jimmy, has always maintained these offences never happened. From the outset, Boyle found processes quite at odds from how we are told they are supposed to be. He said: “Things that you should have: for example, presumption of innocence – nonsense, it doesn’t exist. None of these rights exist in reality.” He claims that lines of evidence undermining the allegations against him were not investigated. Further, he encountered professionals in the criminal justice system who he says were incompetent and even “malicious” and “criminal”. To add further insult, he was later told that he was not considered exonerated because he did not provide evidence proving his innocence (he failed the “innocence test”). As a result, the General Teaching Council for Scotland did not reinstate him and he was unable to return to his teaching career which he had found enormously fulfilling. Like others I have spoken to, Boyle, now in his 60s, hasn’t been able to work since his release: There was so much involved, and fighting with the Teaching Council – you know, it was full time. It really was full time when you’re dealing with these agencies … I do plenty [at Mojo] – I’ve spoken at a number of events … But I had to continue fighting my own fight. Miscarriages of justice have a huge effect on a person’s mental health. But my research found the impact begins long before a conviction – with effects such as anxiety, trauma and depression resulting from the wrongful allegation. Martin (not his real name) detailed the difficulties he experienced from his initial wrongful allegation of rape – including isolation, lack of advice, and a lack of appropriate mental health support. He said: I kept [the rape allegations] to myself and it was horrific, because I didn’t know what was going to happen … Once I was charged … I went to my GP because I was severely depressed. I could barely function. [Counselling] was actually making things worse rather than better … I had looked online … There’s victim support and there’s witness support, but if you’ve been accused there is absolutely nothing. It took over three years from the initial allegation to court proceedings, during which time two other allegations of rape and indecent assault were made and charges were brought. Martin kept the allegations from his employers and friends: You don’t mention it because if you mention it, you’re opening the box and then that becomes a big thing – and God help how you’re going to feel at the end of that conversation. Convicted of rape and indecent assault (the second and third charges), he was sentenced to four years in prison, but successfully appealed on the basis that the Moorov doctrine was misapplied. Moorov is a principle of Scottish law which allows evidence of one crime to corroborate evidence of another. As the charges against him were considered to corroborate one another, having been acquitted of the key (first) charge he should have been acquitted of all. Instead, he spent about a year in prison – yet he considers himself fortunate. The guy [Andrew Malkinson] that won his appeal the other day spent 17 years in prison. I only spent one. And although I shouldn’t have spent any, it could have been a hell of a lot worse. There are a lot of people that haven’t been able to clear their names, there are a lot of people that have spent a long time in prison. I spent one year and managed to clear my name, so I should be thankful for what little happiness I’ve managed to get out of it. Martin was fortunate in that he’d had a good education and had taken detailed notes during his trial, which assisted his appeal. He also helped other prisoners who were struggling to complete required forms for themselves, and managed to get a job in the prison kitchen. Since his release, he has pursued a law degree, eager to use his experience for positive change in the justice system. “I think it’s given me a new perspective really … You know what, life’s too short – let’s just get on with it.” People wrongly accused of crimes are in dire need of support from the moment the initial allegation is made, to help them navigate the complex legal processes and challenging psychological effects of being wrongly accused. Currently there is woefully inadequate mental health support at all stages, from initial allegation to post-release. Of course, there are many guilty people in prison who protest their innocence – but support should not be denied to those who maintain their innocence. Reforms are needed to make it easier for an innocent person to appeal their conviction. The CCRC has suffered a decline in funding, from £9.24 million in 2004 to £6 million in 2022. Over this period, the workload has more than doubled while the Ministry of Justice has reduced CCRC commissioners’ terms of employment from full-time salaried positions to one-day-a-week contracts, making the workload unsustainable. People may also face significant barriers in accessing evidence that would exonerate them such as police files, without which they have little hope of a successful appeal. This was evident in the Malkinson case, where the charity Appeal accessed the police files the CCRC had refused to look at. The lack of accountability and consequences for those who purposely harm innocent people causes further anger and distress to the wrongfully accused and convicted. Yet those affected rarely even receive an apology. This needs to change. Finally, there needs to be greater public awareness of wrongful convictions and allegations, their causes and consequences, and an understanding of their devastating and long-term effects. As Hill told me the year before he died: People think you come out and they give you a few quid … [then you] walk off into the sunset and live happily ever after. If only. I would love to go to bed at night like an ordinary fucking person … without waking up so angry and tense.

Title: State of tech talent report 2025

Published on May 20, 2025 Over the last couple of years, weâve seen companies rewrite the playbook for hiring AI and tech talent. In a landscape defined by fierce competition and rapid change, our latest tech talent report zeroes in on the bold moves, early trends, and strategic pivots reshaping how companies attract and retain top-tier talent in 2025 and beyond. At SignalFire, our Beacon AI platform tracks over 650 million professionals and 80 million organizations to give us a front-row seat to the talent transformations reshaping the industry. Our latest report reveals some sharp shifts: - Entry-level hiring is collapsing - A generational hiring shift is leaving new graduates behind - Elite AI labs are locking in top talent, and retaining them - Geographic power centers are evolving fast While headlines continue to highlight labor market shifts amidst political change and intense AI rivalry among tech giants, our data reveals a more nuanced story. This isnât just about layoffs or remote work. Itâs about a fundamental reset in how, where, and who companies are hiring to build the next generation of technology. The tech world has long been synonymous with innovation, breakneck growth, and boundless opportunities. The door to tech once swung wide open for new grads. Today, itâs barely cracked. The industry's obsession with hiring bright-eyed grads right out of college is colliding with new realities: smaller funding rounds, shrinking teams, fewer new grad programs, and the rise of AI.Â Everyone took a hit in 2023, but while hiring bounced back in 2024 for mid- and senior-level roles, the cut keeps getting deeper for new grads: Even top computer science grads arenât spared. As demand for junior roles declines, even highly credentialed engineering grads are struggling to break into tech, especially at the Big Tech companies. The share of new graduates landing roles at the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla) has dropped by more than half since 2022. Itâs not just a hiring slowdown, itâs a shift in expectations. Todayâs tech employers arenât looking for potential, theyâre looking for proof. Thatâs left new grads stuck in a Catch-22: you need experience to get the job, but you need the job to get experience.Â In a world of leaner teams and tighter budgets, thereâs little room for investment in training. As the pipeline for new talent shrinks at breakneck speed, itâs creating fierce competition for the few entry-level roles that remain. The cruel irony? Companies are posting junior roles but filling them with senior individual contributors (ICs)âa phenomenon known as the experience paradox.Â AI gets a lot of blame for wiping out junior roles post-2022, but the real story is more nuanced, as you can see from the 200+ comments on this Hacker News post and this recent article from The Atlantic. Yes, automation is already replacing some routine tasks, but the bigger driver may be the end of the âfree money madnessâ driven by low interest rates that we saw in 2020-2022, along with the overhiring and inflation it led to. Now, with tighter budgets and shorter runways, companies are hiring leaner and later. Carta data shows that Series A tech startups are 20% smaller than they were in 2020. This shift isnât just about hiring lessâitâs a hiring reset. As AI tools take over more routine, entry-level tasks, companies are prioritizing roles that deliver high-leverage technical output. Big Tech is doubling down on machine learning and data engineering, while non-technical functions like recruiting, product, and sales keep shrinking, making it especially tough for Gen Z and early-career talent to break in. November 2022 didnât just mark the launch of ChatGPTâit kicked off the AI talent race. We analyzed retention across top AI labs, and one clear leader emerged: Anthropic. An impressive 80% of employees hired at least 2 years ago at Anthropic were still at the company at the end of their second yearâa figure that stands out in an industry known for high turnover. DeepMind follows closely at 78%, while OpenAIâs retention trails at 67% but remains on par with large FAANG companies like Meta (64%). Anthropicâs 80% retention isnât just impressiveâitâs a strategic advantage. In a field where turnover means lost time and money, keeping top talent consistently is a game-changer. And itâs not just about keeping talent, itâs about winning it. The tech talent map continues to shift. While San Francisco and New York remain dominant, rising hubs like Toronto, Miami, and San Diego are gaining ground. Meanwhile, Texas cities like Austin are losing momentum, prompting founders to rethink hiring and compensation strategies. More companies are embracing hub-and-spoke models and tailoring compensation philosophies to ensure they secure the right talent mix across diverse locations. Hiring is slowing in most metros, but weâre seeing a reconsolidation of tech jobs around major tech hubs like the Bay Area, Seattle, and NYC. Here are the key geographic trends we saw in 2024:Â 1. Silicon Valley and New York City hold strong: - High talent, high cost: SF and NYC still anchor the AI ecosystem, with over 65% of AI engineers based in these two metros. Despite rising housing costs, shrinking salary advantages, and remote work flexibility, SF and NY continue to attract more tech talent. 2. The sunshine surge - Miami and San Diego are rising fast: These two cities are attracting tech talent not with massive budgets, but with sun, lifestyle, and lower living costs. - Miamiâs mix of tax perks and quality of life has fueled a 12% jump in AI roles, according to recent hiring data. - San Diego saw a 7% rise in Big Tech roles, even as startups in the region lost 3.5% of their workforce in 2024, suggesting talent is being poached upward. In 2024, San Diego County startups raised $5.7 billion in venture capital, marking one of the region's best-performing years on record. 3. Texas cools off: Are Austin and Houston losing their luster? Once the darlings of tech growth, Austin and Houston have been losing startup talent. Lagging infrastructure, a cultural mismatch, fluctuating housing costs, and a renewed emphasis on hybrid RTO policies are motivating startup employees to live closer to traditional hubs. Last year, Austin, which was a post-pandemic growth leader, saw a 6% drop in headcount at VC-backed startups. Houston's drop is even steeper at 10.9%. Some of our predictions from last yearâs report held strong while others veered off course. Hereâs what we got rightâand what we predict is next. The past year made one thing clear: technology alone doesnât build the future, people do. Anthropicâs retention edge and the reshaping of talent hubs prove that the real advantage lies in how you hire, grow, and keep great talent. - For new grads: The training wheels are gone. With fewer entry-level roles, the path forward will rely on bootcamps, open-source, freelancing, and creative projects. Itâs not enough to just master the latest AI tools; learn to fix their flawsâdebugging messy, machine-generated code may be your superpower. - For employers: AI might reduce the short-term need for junior hires, but skipping them entirely risks breaking the long-term talent pipeline. The industryâs future depends on equipping the next generation with skills that grow alongside the evolving technology landscape. (Read our article on how to build a multi-generational company here.) ________________________ Methodology Note: This report uses data from our proprietary Beacon AI platform, an intelligence engine that tracks 650+ million individuals and 80+ million organizations. We analyze millions of data points on hiring trends, geographic movements, and more to spot emerging talent and help our portfolio companies build teams and products faster. Here's the approach we used to analyze the data for this report: - âBig techâ represents the top 15 technology companies by market cap.- âStartupsâ represents companies funded by the Top 100 VC firms that closed a Seed through Series C round in the previous 4 years.- âTop computer science graduatesâ represents graduates from the top 20 engineering programs in the U.S. according to the U.S. Newsâ Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs Rankings. - For the AI Labs retention analysis, we excluded some newer AI labs (like DeepSeek and xAI/Grok) because they had not been operating over the whole time period we looked at (2023-2024). We focused on entities with distinct LinkedIn company profiles to ensure clean, accurate employee data. Meta AI wasnât included, as itâs not listed as a distinct entity from Meta as a whole on LinkedIn.- All employee retention numbers are derived from public, self-reported LinkedIn profiles, which may include inaccuracies or incomplete employment date ranges.- âMagnificent Sevenâ companies (MAG7) include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. _______________________ SignalFire is the first VC firm built like a technology company to better serve the needs of founders as they build and scale their startups.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 08: In this photo illustration, the logo of Adobe Inc. is displayed on a ... More smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on June 08, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will announce its earnings on Thursday, June 12, 2025. Historically, the stock has shown negative reactions the day following earnings announcements. In the last five years, Adobe’s stock has declined in 70% of cases, with a median drop of 7.4% and a maximum one-day loss of 16.8%. For traders focused on events, recognizing these historical trends can provide a competitive edge. You have two primary strategies to think about: Analysts anticipate Adobe’s earnings to be $4.97 per share with sales of $5.8 billion. This reflects an increase from the same quarter last year, during which earnings were $4.48 per share on revenue of $5.31 billion. Although the company’s subscription business has been thriving and is likely to boost sales this quarter, revenue growth in the generative AI sector has lagged behind expectations. It will be intriguing to observe how this trend evolves in the forthcoming report. Regarding the fundamentals, Adobe currently boasts a market capitalization of $180 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company has generated $22 billion in revenue, with $8.0 billion in operating profits and a net income of $6.8 billion. If you’re looking for upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative — it has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns surpassing 91% since its inception.

See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional information about observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings is provided along with the statistics in the table below. ADBE 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A strategy with relatively lower risk (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to investigate the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D display the highest correlation, a trader can take a “long” position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D pertains to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and following 5D returns. ADBE Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the price adjustment might start before the earnings are disclosed. Here is some historical data comparing the past post-earnings performance of Adobe stock with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Adobe. For an equitable comparison, peer stock returns are also represented as post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. ADBE Correlation With Peer Earnings Discover more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), providing substantial returns for investors. Additionally, if you are seeking upside with a more stable experience than an individual stock like Adobe, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved >91% returns since its inception.

Title: Inside the rise of layoff support groups
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-rise-layoff-support-groups-lucrative-influencers-careers-employment-2025-6

Shaffan Mustafa was laid off for the first time in 2020. Four years later, in January 2024, the software engineer in Ohio was laid off again. Then, in September, he was let go from a contract job. "I wish I could say I didn't have experience with layoffs, but unfortunately, I have a bit too much," he tells me. The first time, he found it depressing. It took him 10 months of scouring job boards and hundreds of unanswered applications before he landed his next role at a local consulting company. The second time, says the 29-year-old, "I was still sad about it, but at that point it wasn't as unexpected." His third layoff in five years has been different. In the middle of yet another job search a few months ago, he came across a Substack called Laid Off. "I probably typed something like 'being laid off sucks' and found it that way," he says. After reading several people's layoff stories on the Substack, he felt less alone. He became a paid subscriber and joined the dedicated Discord group where members went into more detail about their layoffs, shared job updates, and ranted about the state of the economy. Mustafa checks the group daily, sometimes every few hours. The Substack is the brainchild of Melanie Ehrenkranz. After being laid off herself from her role as a newsletter editor at a financial technology startup in 2023, she wanted a way to process the experience. "I felt like there wasn't really a lot of spotlight on the individual experience of a layoff outside of a LinkedIn post or a tweet or a group chat with a couple of your friends," she says. Ehrenkranz, 35, found a job nine months after being laid off, but she decided to launch the newsletter anyway. In August 2024, she shared her first post, an interview with a social media producer laid off from Condé Nast, asking her questions such as, "Where were you when you found out?" and "What was your greatest financial concern with the sudden loss of income?" and "Has being laid off changed how you view your relationship to work?" She has since been inundated with people willing to share their stories. Within two months, Laid Off grew to 5,000 subscribers. Recently, it surpassed 10,000. The number of Americans facing long-term unemployment has crept up from 1.05 million in February 2023 to over 1.67 million as of last month. Since 2022, more than half a million tech workers have been laid off — one analysis found there had been about 90,000 tech layoffs in the first five months of 2025. Amid the job losses, a new culture around layoffs has sprung up. Workers are livestreaming their layoffs to audiences of millions on TikTok. The post-layoff note on LinkedIn has become so ubiquitous that it's now a social media cliché. Many of the newly laid-off have no qualms declaring themselves #OpenToWork. There's even layoff merch now. To welcome the legions of freshly unemployed, a network of layoff support groups has emerged. On Reddit, r/Layoffs is in the top 2% of subreddits by size, with more than 120,000 members. On LinkedIn, there are more than 100 groups for those affected by layoffs, including company-specific groups for Meta, X, and Amazon. Across social platforms, layoff influencers are attracting thousands of followers by sharing advice and commiserating with those in the same boat. While workers can't change the fact of being laid off, they are no longer taking it lying down. In the 1990s, layoffs had become more or less standard business practice, but there was still a major taboo around them. "We've all heard those stories about a dad who was laid off," says Denise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. "Every day, instead of going to work, he goes to the mall and spends eight hours there before coming home. He's embarrassed to not be working." Then the pandemic changed layoff culture. More than a fifth of the American workforce was laid off during the first few months of COVID-19, a decline in employment not seen since the end of World War II. Layoffs stopped being seen as an individual failing but as an unfortunate byproduct of economic instability. People stuck at home on their laptops all day began broadcasting their unemployed status. LinkedIn introduced its green #OpenToWork banner in June 2020. The post-layoff note, with its cheery tone and calls to "reach out if you're hiring," quickly became standard practice. As more layoffs have hit in the past year, the stigma has vanished even more. "It used to be if you got laid off, it's because you're a screwup — you're just a bad employee," Mustafa says. "Now it's just par for the course." For some, being laid off became not just a LinkedIn update but lucrative content. Giovanna Ventola, a commercial real estate worker, first went viral for sharing advice to other job seekers after being laid off three times in three years, Bloomberg reported. She has gained nearly 30,000 followers sharing her perspective on coping with unemployment and has launched a professional networking platform, Rhize. Others have documented their days-in-the-life navigating being newly unemployed. In her newsletter, Ehrenkranz has spotlighted stories from everyone from a design intern for the National Park Service to a creative director at Google. "I definitely think it's opening up people's eyes to the fact that a layoff is not this thing that happens to a certain type of person in a certain industry," Ehrenkranz says. "It's something that can happen to anyone." The new visibility of layoffs doesn't make it any easier when a call with HR gets added to your calendar. Research published in the International Journal of Mental Health found that losing a job increased the risk of depression, risky substance use, and suicide. For Mustafa, being laid off meant involuntarily grinding his teeth at night and having debilitating stress headaches. Christine Reichenbach was laid off from her chief of staff role at the cloud computing company VMware in January 2024 while she was 34 weeks pregnant. It quickly sent her into a downward spiral. She ended up on postpartum anxiety medication and, despite having ample savings, put her baby in day care at seven weeks to frantically hunt for a new job. "It was very illogical," she says. "It's just what it did to my brain." At the time, Reichenbach was introduced to a Discord group called The Labor Club, a referral-only application-based group of 500 women who have experienced being laid off while pregnant or postpartum. "It's a specific niche that was just awful to experience," Reichenbach says. Her husband, though supportive, couldn't relate to what she was going through. "He has no idea what it's like to be laid off pregnant." Instead, she had a pool of women to turn to for both practical resources and, importantly, emotional support. After some soul-searching, Reichenbach decided to leave Big Tech altogether and founded her own company, The Phoenix Formula, at the start of this year with the goal of empowering other job seekers. She is also building her own support group, Beyond the Layoffs, on LinkedIn and Slack. "People need a space for this to actually be constructive," she says. If members need a space to yell in all caps, there's a channel for that. "I hope it's a place people can vent on a bad day and it's not on social media for hiring managers to see," she says. As the stigma around layoffs disappears, the boundaries of professionalism on social media have become increasingly blurred. Ask any recruiter, and they'll say bad-mouthing a previous employer on social media is tantamount to career cyanide. "It gives me alarm bells," says Brad Thomas, a business manager at Orange Quarter, a tech recruitment company in New York. "It's the same as when a candidate interviews somewhere — talking bad in an unprofessional manner about a previous employer is just not a good look." His advice when it comes to posting on social media is to keep it professional. In the new culture of layoffs, however, there is an important caveat. "The size of the company makes a difference," Thomas explains. "If someone has a pop at Meta or Google, it's less personal and less damaging to the brand versus a startup of 30 people." Earlier this year, when Meta let go of some 4,000 workers, branding them as "low performers" on the way out, the departing employees refused to leave quietly, pushing back on the label on LinkedIn. As Business Insider's Aki Ito wrote, "This is something we haven't seen before in the professional world: Employees sticking up for themselves in public, and calling out their former employer for misrepresenting their work." Both the social media posts and the private communities offer a kind of testimony that shifts blame from the employee back onto the employer. Ehrenkranz has had many people tell her that being interviewed for Laid Off or filling out her surveys is a cathartic experience. "A layoff these days is a 10-minute Zoom call, shut your computer, and then you're thrown into this new chapter," she says. Having a dedicated space to talk about being laid off with those who get it is a relief for Mustafa. "I don't really feel like I'm being pushy or shoving my layoff experiences down someone's throat," he says. While there is power in numbers, for some, those numbers can be overwhelming. A friend of Mustafa's left the Discord group shortly after joining. "She was getting emotionally burned out from hearing about layoffs," he explains. "She's fortunately a freelance writer, so she's making some money. She can just tune out that stuff if she wants to. For me, I'm still desperately tuned in." Ehrenkranz focuses on making sure the Laid Off community is a toxic-positivity-free zone. "I would say the vibe is just real," she says. "There's no 'Everything happens for a reason' or 'You'll get the next one.' People don't want to hear that." Rather than just a place to wallow, many of these support groups are designed as both a safety net and a springboard for when members are ready to begin the hunt for their next role. Fana Yohannes, a social media consultant and former Meta employee, founded the group Here2Help to give job seekers a leg up. In the wake of the 2020 layoffs, she posted on Instagram that she was open to reviewing and providing feedback on five people's résumés. "One person replied and was like, actually, I'd be down to help too," she says. From there, Yohannes says, Here2Help grew to 200 mentors who helped about 2,000 people find new opportunities during COVID. "We've come to an era where layoffs are part of the job," Yohannes says. "We have to kind of be strategic." After four months of sending out applications, Mustafa has a second interview lined up for another tech role. Even if he gets the job, he plans on staying in the Laid Off community for a while — just in case. "I can't trust these people anymore," he says about employers.

These often require context, judgment, and adaptation, making them difficult to automate with simple rule-based code. While traditional automation is possible, it usually means hardcoding endless edge cases. Agents offer a more flexible approach. They use context to decide what to do next, reducing manual effort on tedious steps while keeping a review process in place for important decisions. The most effective AI agents are narrow, tightly scoped, and domain-specific. Here's how to approach building one. Start by simulating the agent manually, before writing any code. Understand the task the way a person would approach it, step by step. Use real inputs, whether they’re screenshots, API responses, or messy CSV data. Feed those into an LLM manually and guide it through the process with prompts that mirror the actual workflow. As you go, perform any resulting actions yourself. Pay attention to which parts feel repetitive or mechanical. These are strong candidates for automation later. Expect early results to be rough. When we started building v0.dev in 2023, LLMs struggled to generate reliable HTML. The breakthrough wasn’t from better models, but from narrowing the scope and using structured inputs with Tailwind. If the model consistently fails to make progress, even with adjustments, the task may not be a good fit for an agent. But if it works, or even comes close, it’s worth continuing. Once your manual simulation shows that the task is viable, begin writing code. This is where you build the skeleton of your agent. Start by automating how it collects inputs. Use APIs, scrapers, screenshots, or anything else that fits the problem, then model the agent’s process as a loop or a simple state machine. Gather input, perform deterministic computation where possible, call the model when logic or judgment is needed, evaluate the result, and decide whether to continue or exit. LLMs are non-deterministic. If you can write a normal function to handle a step, do it. Use plain code for parsing, calculating, or sorting. Anything that does not require reasoning. Example of a stock analysis agent Don't be afraid of plain old programming. Save the LLM for parts that truly need judgment. Building AI agents might seem like a new thing that calls for new abstractions, but it is just regular programming. Use if statements, loops, or switches, whatever fits. Don’t overthink the structure. For common patterns, see our AI SDK agent docs. The agent "works" when it reliably produces acceptable results with little to no intervention. Now that the agent is running end to end, shift your focus to improving quality. This means making the agent perform well on both specific examples and a wide range of real-world inputs. Start by tightening the loop. Refine your prompts. Make tool calls more precise. Remove unnecessary retries. Replace model calls with plain deterministic functions wherever you can. If the agent produces incomplete results, use a second model to critique the results of the first model and continue the work. At this stage, intuition and hands-on testing are your best tools. Iterate until the agent feels solid when running against real examples. Once the core loop is stable, introduce structured evaluations to test performance across a broad range of inputs and edge cases. This helps catch regressions early and ensures quality holds up as the agent evolves. AI agents expand what software can do, but building one doesn't require reinventing how you think about programming. The most reliable agents are built with the same fundamentals: clear logic, good structure, and tight feedback loops. Before committing to any implementation, test the task manually using real inputs and prompts. If the model can almost get there with help, it’s probably worth building. From there, structure the logic using ordinary code and only rely on the model when necessary. Once the agent is working, focus on making it resilient. Both on individual inputs and across real-world complexity. To recap, agents are useful when: The task is difficult to automate with traditional code Prompting the model manually shows signs of success You scope the agent narrowly and build on solid software practices You optimize both with hands-on intuition and structured evaluation When built right, AI agents feel like magic. But there’s no sorcery behind it. Just smart systems with reasoning built in. Ready to build? Get started with the AI SDK to build reliable, scoped AI agents using real software patterns.

Title: AI Is Taking Thousands Of Jobs; Is Yours At Risk?

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/08/2025 7:48:31 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Just as the internet radically changed how America conducts business, artificial intelligence (AI) is also making waves in the workplace by taking thousands of jobs. It’s an outcome that industry experts have warned would happen, and professionals across multiple employment sectors have already been affected.Beyond artists and content creators, AI is also impacting professionals in marketing, technology, translation, various levels of administration, and management. It has been a silent and ongoing trend for two years, but tech insiders say this is just the beginning.A senior software engineer at Microsoft, Nandita Giri, shared her thoughts with The Epoch Times on what kind of near-term changes Americans can expect as a result of ramped-up workplace AI integration.“AI is particularly effective at replacing routine, predictable tasks ... jobs in data entry, customer support, transcription, and logistics are the most vulnerable,” Giri said. “In software engineering, even some junior [developer] testing roles are being replaced or reshaped with AI-driven tooling. Back-office operations across health care, finance, and legal are also at high risk.”Giri has observed a shift away from human workers in favor of AI in enterprise software development, where she said companies are quietly removing what they call “coordination overhead.” She said this is happening as AI tools become more reliable for things like task triage, scheduling, and summarization.“AI agents have enabled a single engineer to manage what used to be a multi-person workflow, especially in automation pipelines and internal support tasks,” she said.Restructuring WorkflowCahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Beyond artists and content creators, AI is also impacting professionals in marketing, technology, translation, various levels of administration, and management. It has been a silent and ongoing trend for two years, but tech insiders say this is just the beginning.A senior software engineer at Microsoft, Nandita Giri, shared her thoughts with The Epoch Times on what kind of near-term changes Americans can expect as a result of ramped-up workplace AI integration.“AI is particularly effective at replacing routine, predictable tasks ... jobs in data entry, customer support, transcription, and logistics are the most vulnerable,” Giri said. “In software engineering, even some junior [developer] testing roles are being replaced or reshaped with AI-driven tooling. Back-office operations across health care, finance, and legal are also at high risk.”Giri has observed a shift away from human workers in favor of AI in enterprise software development, where she said companies are quietly removing what they call “coordination overhead.” She said this is happening as AI tools become more reliable for things like task triage, scheduling, and summarization.“AI agents have enabled a single engineer to manage what used to be a multi-person workflow, especially in automation pipelines and internal support tasks,” she said.Restructuring WorkflowCahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees.

Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Back-office operations across health care, finance, and legal are also at high risk.”Giri has observed a shift away from human workers in favor of AI in enterprise software development, where she said companies are quietly removing what they call “coordination overhead.” She said this is happening as AI tools become more reliable for things like task triage, scheduling, and summarization.“AI agents have enabled a single engineer to manage what used to be a multi-person workflow, especially in automation pipelines and internal support tasks,” she said.Restructuring WorkflowCahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030.

The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Cahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees.

During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025.

In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely. The future is looking pretty grim these days... Every job that isn’t physical labour in some way is in danger of being replaced by AI, as it grows and develops its capabilities. The billionaire class does not care because it is their dream to be rich and not have to pay anybody. Starvation may make a comeback in the good old USA.. “There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now” Did any of these credentialed egg-heads have any sympathy when robots took over manufacturing? Well I certainly hope so 🤞 ...all the attractive women on only fans to be replaced by AI models.... Starvation has positive implications in reduction of diabetes, heart disease, strokes, knee & hip joint wear, even cancer. I am mostly retired, except for a part-time teaching gig that is mine as long as I want it. I am thankful I don’t have to worry about being booted out the door by “artificial intelligence”, and then finding something else that might also be made obsolete by “artificial intelligence.” It isn’t just jobs that are being made obsolete, but humans. What a nightmarish existence. People are made to work and, ideally, to find some satisfaction and sense of purpose in their labor. Funny, no one gave a shit when automation displaced middle class factory workers, or when work was shipped overseas. cry me a river college educated writers, translators, and managers, automation is now hitting your jobs. i think of AI as the ‘great test taker.’ so anyone who has a job that relies on memory and test taking skills—that is, credentialing or expert-ism will be most at risk. anyone whose job relies on convincing your boss that you know a lot more than him about some specialized area will be at risk. so basically AI has the potential to be the great BSer of the world. thus, it has great potential to replace self styled experts. it also, imho, has the potential to be the great questioner of humanity. thus, it threatens to replace (or perhaps augment) the devil in his main job, as the great prosecutor of humanity. so if AI is given autonomy, judicial, or self-decision making power though, look out; a lot of bad things are going to happen. it will become the inquisition for the powers that be.
