The BusConnects corridor linking Tallaght and Clondalkin to Dublin city centre, has been approved by An Bord Pleanála, almost a year after the decision was initially due. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has sought permission for 12 dedicated bus lanes as part of its programme to overhaul the capital’s bus system. The Tallaght/Clondalkin core bus corridor is the ninth scheme approved to date. The NTA submitted the Tallaght/Clondalkin application in April 2023. The board had been due to issue its decision in November 2023, but despite determining there was no requirement for an oral hearing, permission was not granted until this month. The 15.5km corridor will run from The Square Shopping Centre, Tallaght and Nangor Road, Clondalkin, to Nicholas Street near St Patrick’s Cathedral in the city centre. The route passes through Ballymount, Walkinstown, Drimnagh, Crumlin and Dolphin’s Barn, and is expected to remove more than 100,000 daily car trips from the roads. The BusConnects programme has two strands: a network redesign and the 12 bus corridors. Unlike the redesign project, which involves the reorganisation of services on existing road infrastructure, the corridors require construction to achieve segregation of bus and cycle lanes from traffic. In some instances this necessitates road widening, and the acquisition of property, including parts of front gardens, and felling of trees. An Bord Pleanála received 55 submissions on the Tallaght/Clondalkin project, mostly from local residents along the route, as well as 19 objections to compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) for land acquisition, the majority of which came from commercial property owners. The 55 submissions varied from residents concerned about the loss of privacy, green space and safety concerns in relation to road widening; to the reduction in space for cars and the requirement for private motorists to take more circuitous routes. Other submissions said insufficient provision had been made for cyclists, with bicycles required to share space with buses and cars over parts of the route. Most CPO objections related to loss of parking for customers and deliveries. One homeowner objected to the acquisition of 3m of his driveway, leaving him with 10m, which was insufficient, he said, as “parking is required for at least six cars and space to turn in the driveway”. In recommending permission be granted the board’s inspector Donal Donnelly said the scheme would “make a significant contribution to carbon reduction, the easing of congestion and the creation of more sustainable travel patterns for the growing population”. It was also “essential to bring about improved connections, particularly for non-car users, the disadvantaged and vulnerable road users”. [ Blanchardstown route is latest BusConnects corridor to be challenged in High CourtOpens in new window ] The impact on private car users had “been kept to a minimum”, he said. “The fact that two-way general traffic has been retained throughout most of this core bus corridor, indicates to me that the proposed scheme may have gone further to accentuate modal shift from the private car to bus transport/active travel. “Had the proposed scheme been designed at the present time, when climate change is becoming increasingly apparent, rather than a number of years ago, it may have been more radical in tackling car dominance.” However, he said, “on balance, I have concluded that the overall benefits of the proposed scheme considerably outweigh the negatives”. The eight other schemes approved by the board run to the city from Liffey Valley, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Ballymun/Finglas, Swords, Ringsend, Blanchardstown and Lucan. Routes from Templeogue/Rathfarnham, Kimmage and Bray await the decision of the board. Three of the approved schemes, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock and Blanchardstown, are the subject of ongoing judicial review proceedings. Construction of the first schemes is due to start next year.

Title: Why ETFSwap (ETFS) Could Be The Hottest Investment Of 2024: Don’t Miss Out On This Groundbreaking Crypto Project

The last quarter of the year has historically led to significant price increases for cryptocurrencies. With only two months left in 2024, investors are moving towards promising crypto projects. ETFSwap (ETFS) has gained the interest of the crypto community, with several industry observers regarding it as the hottest investment of 2024. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a groundbreaking crypto project that aims to add exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the blockchain through tokenization. ETFSwap (ETFS) will allow its users to convert between cryptocurrencies and a range of ETFs, including Currency ETFs, Crypto ETFs, Index ETFs, Commodity ETFs, and more. Notably, the crypto project’s team will work closely with Mica-Compliant investment banks to guarantee the legitimacy and financial integrity of its tokenized assets. Thanks to its blockchain-based foundation, ETFSwap’s ETF transactions will be faster, safer, and more cost-effective, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. The ETFSwap platform is also built on the ERC20 standard, which will allow for staking, token swaps, liquidity provision, and more. ETFSwap (ETFS) will redefine ETF trading further by providing market-making and perpetual trading capabilities, with round-the-clock market coverage and margin options of up to 10x. The platform will also feature the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, which are AI-based tools that will conduct various analyses to give user-specific investment recommendations. To access the ETFSwap platform, users will require the ETFS token. This criterion gives the ETFS token utility and makes sure its holders use the complete set of ETF services and advantages offered on the platform. The ETFS token will also be used for other functions, including governance, fee payment, conversion, and interoperability. ETFSwap (ETFS) began with a private fundraising round, securing $750,000 from investors who share the crypto project’s vision. The presale round was then initiated to offer the opportunity for broader participation, with 40% of the fixed 1 billion ETFS token supply set aside for distribution. Since the presale launch, ETFSwap (ETFS) has achieved several key milestones. Most notably, the platform went live on the testnet on October 9, with its core functionality and UI thoroughly tested. Additionally, CyberScope and SolidProof audited the crypto project’s smart contracts and team KYC. ETFSwap (ETFS) was also successfully listed on CoinMarketCap, further boosting its credibility. The ETFSwap presale has also seen remarkable progress, with the ETFS price increasing by more than 350% from its Stage 1 value of $0.00854 to its current $0.03846 in Stage 3. This stage is already 62% complete, with less than 28 million ETFS tokens remaining and more than $5.61 million raised, reflecting strong investor confidence in the crypto project. Crypto ETFs have been rising in popularity in 2024, driven by major investment firms like BlackRock entering the space and the emergence of new options like Solana ETFs. ETFSwap (ETFS) is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this growing interest by offering a decentralized and more versatile platform for ETF trading and investing. The crypto project is also set to launch its own ETF in 2025, making it among the hottest investments of 2024. Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which also ranks among the hottest investments in 2024. The inclusion of AI-driven tools reduces human error, speeds up decision-making processes, and empowers users to make informed choices, ensuring a more robust and profitable trading experience. This gives ETFSwap (ETFS) a significant edge over many ETF trading platforms, potentially attracting more users over time. Furthermore, the massive investments and positive comments from crypto experts suggest that ETFSwap (ETFS) is gaining significant popularity while in its early stages. Low-cap tokens like ETFSwap (ETFS) are usually among the hottest investments because they have the ability to multiply in value rapidly as demand increases. This, coupled with a relatively low entry price, means that even small investments could yield substantial profits for investors, making ETFSwap (ETFS) one of the hottest investments of 2024. While investment varies depending on individual goals and risk tolerances, the technology, potential, and massive investments in the ETFSwap (ETFS) crypto project suggest that it could be one of the hottest investments of 2024.

Title: Ray Dalio doesn't like the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio isn’t too thrilled about the prospect of either a Kamala Harris or (second) Donald Trump administration. “Both of the candidates worry me,” Dalio told CNBC in an interview at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. “This left, right and fighting each other is a problem as it becomes more of the extremes,” he said. “I think there needs to be a bringing of Americans together, that middle of that, and making great reforms. … There needs to be a strong leader of the middle, I believe, that makes great reforms. ... Neither of the candidates does that for me.” Dalio, who has previously criticized the worsening divisions in U.S. politics (going so far as to warn that the country may be “on the brink” of a civil war back in May), said he is concerned about a number of issues facing the country that he feels neither candidate is ready to address. “The debt is concerning, the internal conflict is concerning, the external conflict is concerning, and certainly the climate and the cost of the climate is concerning,” he said. National debt, which is nearing the $36 trillion mark, has become a major area of concern for Dalio, as well as several other business leaders, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.53%) CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock (BLK-0.03%) CEO Larry Fink. “We have a real debt problem,” Dalio said. “I think one man’s debts is another man’s assets.” Dimon has similarly warned that the debt problem could be a thorn in the side of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to keep inflation down. The JPMorgan chief has said he is “a little more skeptical that inflation is going to go away so easily.” Although inflation has been trending downward, Dimon government deficits as a major inflationary risk that could cause price growth to spike again in coming years. Although Dalio said Trump will likely be better for domestic capital markets, both candidates’ plans will likely add to the ballooning debt. That’s in line with a recent report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). The analysis found that both candidates’ proposed economic agendas are almost guaranteed to raise the federal debt by at least a couple trillion dollars — but Trump would add nearly double what Harris would contribute. While Harris would add $3.5 trillion in debt through fiscal year 2035, Trump is expected to add $7.5 trillion, according to the CRFB. According to a Goldman Sachs (GS-0.80%) report from September, a Harris win and a Democratic sweep would be the best-case scenario for the overall U.S. economy, noting that her middle-class tax credits would outweigh any downward pressure on investment from higher corporate taxes.

Title: Dropbox lays off 20% of employees and joins Big Tech's flattening trend. Read CEO Drew Houston's memo.

Dropbox is the latest major company to slash its staff and flatten its organizational structure. In an email sent to employees on Wednesday, its CEO and cofounder, Drew Houston, announced that the cloud-storage company was laying off 528 employees — roughly 20% of its workforce. "As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I'm truly sorry to those impacted by this change," Houston wrote. These cuts come as the company undergoes what he called a "transitional period." It's focusing its efforts on its maturing file-sync-and-share business and products such as Dash, Dropbox's AI-powered work assistant. "However, navigating this transition while maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable," Houston wrote. The Dropbox chief cited "softening demand and macro headwinds" in the company's core business. "But external factors are only part of the story," he added. "We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down." Houston said that the layoffs were targeting "over-invested or underperforming" areas. Dropbox is the latest example of a tech giant thinning out its management ranks to create a flatter organizational structure with the goal of moving faster. Amazon announced a similar move earlier this year, with CEO Andy Jassy saying he wanted senior leadership teams "to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025." Mark Zuckerberg instituted manager cuts and increased the average number of direct reports for Meta managers after complaining about "managers managing managers." Dropbox's layoffs come more than a year after the company's decision to cut about 16% of its workforce, or 500 employees, in April 2023. Houston's memo to employees at the time also attributed those layoffs to headwinds and freeing up investment bandwidth for more products powered by artificial intelligence. Starting Wednesday, affected workers will be eligible for 16 weeks of pay, with an additional week of pay for each completed year of tenure, the memo said. They will also see their fourth-quarter equity vest and can access free job-placement and coaching services, it added. Affected employees can also keep their work-issued devices. Dropbox did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Jump to

Here's how the company performed, compared with analysts' expectations based on a survey by LSEG: Revenue increased 16% year over year in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, according to a statement. Net income rose 11% to $24.67 billion from $22.29 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the current quarter, Microsoft called for revenue in the range of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion. That implies 10.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $69.83 billion in revenue. Outside suppliers are late in delivering data center infrastructure to Microsoft, meaning the company won't be able to meet demand in the fiscal second quarter. "I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply-demand will match up," CEO Satya Nadella said on a conference call with analysts. In August, Microsoft said it would revise the reporting of business segments to reflect its management approach. Mobility and security services, along with some Windows revenue, are now part of the productivity and business processes unit, which includes Office software. Revenue from productivity and business processes rose 12% to $28.32 billion in the quarter, topping the $27.9 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. It's 38% higher than the $20.45 billion midpoint of the forecast that management gave in July, because the actual total accounts for the changes. Investors received a clearer picture of cloud computing consumption at Microsoft. For the first time, the Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric excludes mobility and security and Power BI data analytics sales. Azure growth for the quarter came in at 33%, or 34% at constant currency, with 12 points coming from artificial intelligence services. CNBC's consensus for Azure growth was 32.8%, while StreetAccount's was 29.4%. "Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity," Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, said on the call. Hood called for 31% to 32% Azure growth at constant currency for the fiscal second quarter. The full intelligent cloud segment, including Azure, Windows Server and enterprise services, generated $24.09 billion in revenue. That's up 20% and slightly more than the $24.04 StreetAccount consensus. On Tuesday, Google reported 35% annual growth in its rival cloud business to $11.35 billion. Amazon, which leads the cloud infrastructure market, is scheduled to report results Thursday. Microsoft has shrunken the size of its segment called more personal computing through the reporting changes. In the latest quarter, it contributed $13.18 billion in revenue, up about 17% from a yeaer earlier and above the $12.56 billion StreetAccount consensus. The company saw 2% growth in sales of devices and sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Industry researcher Gartner estimated that quarterly PC shipments declined 1.3%. Microsoft's AI investments continue to be a major focus for investors, as the company builds out its infrastructure and ramps up chip spending to handle heftier workloads. Microsoft is the main investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which was valued at $157 billion in a financing round earlier this month. As of Sept. 30, Microsoft had racked up more than $108 billion in finance leases that had not started, which UBS analysts have said might include third-party cloud spending to meet AI demand. At the same time, Microsoft has been spending more cash on property and equipment. In the first quarter, spending grew 50% year over year to $14.92 billion. The consensus among analysts polled by Capital IQ was $14.58 billion. As of Wednesday's close, Microsoft was up about 15% for the year, while the Nasdaq gained around 24% during the same period.

The company's stock price was down slightly in after-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Sales in the third quarter jumped 19% year over year while net income grew 35% to $15.7 billion from $11.6 billion a year earlier. That represents Meta's lowest year-over-year growth for net income since the second quarter of 2023. The company reported 3.29 billion daily active people for the third quarter. That was up 5% year over year but came in below analysts' expectations of 3.31 billion. Meta also raised capital expenditures guidance for the 2024 fiscal year to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion previously. Additionally, the company said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 due to an acceleration in infrastructure expenses. "Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there, too," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday on a call with analysts. Zuckerberg has been pointing to the company's massive investments in artificial intelligence, which includes spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's popular graphics processing units, as helping improve the company's core online ad business in the aftermath of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update. The company has been improving upon and building more data centers to help provide the technology infrastructure needed for its AI strategy. More than one million advertisers have used Meta's generative AI advertising tools, Zuckerberg said. Meta said it expects total expenses for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of between $96 billion and $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 billion to $99 billion. Meta's advertising revenue came in at $39.9 billion for the quarter, up 18.7% year over year. Advertising accounted for 98.3% of Meta's total revenue in the third quarter. Revenue from Meta's Asia-Pacific region grew 15%, representing the company's slowest-growing region, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on the call. That was down from growth of 28% in the second quarter, and Li attributed the deceleration to lapping demand from China advertisers. Investors were concerned that slower digital ad spending by China-linked online retailers such as Temu and Shein would affect Meta's overall revenue. Meta said it is expecting fourth-quarter revenue to be between $45 billion and $48 billion. The midpoint of that guidance is higher than the analyst consensus of $46.3 billion. The company's Reality Labs hardware unit posted an operating loss of $4.4 billion in the third quarter, which was less than analysts' expectations of $4.68 billion. Sales in that unit jumped 29% year over year to $270 million in the third quarter, trailing analysts' expectations of $310.4 million. Since 2020, Meta's Reality Labs unit has recorded an operating loss of more than $58 billion. The company's overall headcount grew 9% year over year to 72,404 as of Sept. 30. The social media company's results come a day after digital ad companies Alphabet, Reddit and Snap all reported solid quarterly earnings. Microsoft reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines. Alphabet on Tuesday said third-quarter sales from its Google Cloud unit came in at $11.35 billion, up 35% compared to a year prior. The company attributed its strong cloud results to its AI offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers. Microsoft on Wednesday reported that revenue from its Azure cloud unit was up 33% year over year, with 12 points coming from AI services. Apple and Amazon report quarterly financials on Thursday.

PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 29: In this photo illustration, the Meta logo is displayed on the screen of ... [+] an iPhone in front of a Facebook logo on October 29, 2021 in Paris, France. On October 28, during the Facebook Connect virtual conference, Mark Zuckerberg announced the name change of Facebook, believing that the term Facebook was too closely linked to that of the platform of the same name, launched in 2004. It is now official, the Facebook company changes its name and becomes Meta. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Meta Platforms scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $602/share and is currently trading near that level. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: Click on the chart to join MarketSurge The company is expected to report a gain of $5.19/share on $40.14 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $5.41/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78, in 2021 the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. Looking forward, the company is expected to grow its earnings to $21.38 in 2024 and then $24.48 in 2025. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 30 which is only 1.3x the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is acting very well and just hit a fresh all-time high. In the short-term the stock is extended and can easily pullback if earnings fail to impress. That said, the stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Meanwhile, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been featured on FindLeadingStocks.com One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Long Bitcoin, Short Bonds: The New Billionaire Investors’ Strategy

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 30: Larry Fink on stage at the 2022 New York Times DealBook on ... [+] November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Thos Robinson/Getty Images for The New York Times) Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as an alternative to the fiat money system, and it increasingly embraces this role. In what may be the clearest signal of the bitcoin-fiat rivalry, more billionaire investors are turning to bitcoin as a hedge. Wall Street titans Larry Fink (BlackRock), Stanley Druckenmiller (Duquesne Family Office), and Paul Tudor Jones (Tudor Investment Corporation) have recently voiced their skepticism over U.S. monetary policy. At the same time, they acknowledge bitcoin as a modern-day substitute for gold, with real potential to shield their portfolios against inflation. Yes, inflation expectations persist, despite the official reports of a 2.4% inflation rate in September. These legendary investors warn that inflationary government policies and the escalating national debt may prolong inflation beyond current forecasts. This would make bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, an attractive diversification asset. Speaking last week at Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative, Larry Fink reaffirmed his expectations for lasting inflation. BlackRock's CEO believes that "we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen" due to the governmental inflationary policies. He added that we’re not going to see interest rates as low as forecasted, predicting only a modest 0.25% rate cut this year. Such an environment is not the best for investing in government bonds. Inflation will erode real returns, and with no sizable rate cuts, current higher-yield bonds won't appreciate enough to outperform. Stanley Druckenmiller takes an even more skeptical stance, openly betting against the Fed. "We shorted bonds the day the Fed cut 50 [basis points] because we thought it was a mistake," he said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month. The veteran investor is known for achieving an average annual return of 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital. He now notes that while the Fed is pushing a restrictive narrative, the market is signaling otherwise. “Equities at a record high, gold at a record high, GDP above trend, credit tight, bank earnings and forecasts look good... crypto going crazy. We don’t see any restrictions whatsoever.” Paul Tudor Jones tackled another persistent U.S. problem: the enormous $35 trillion national debt that seems to spiral out of control. The billionaire hedge fund manager told CNBC that inflation risks loom after November's election, as both Harris and Trump pledged to increase spending and cut taxes, worsening the debt outlook. Jones believes the only viable path forward is to inflate and grow out of the debt burden. This means maintaining low interest rates and allowing inflation to rise, "inflating away" the real value of debt. This would ease the debt burden while avoiding immediate austerity measures, notoriously difficult for any politician to implement. From this perspective, betting against bonds looks like a wise move indeed. However, does it mean that bitcoin can truly fulfill its role as an inflation hedge? The “digital gold” narrative is among bitcoin’s most famous ones. Yet, it is often challenged by people arguing that such a volatile asset cannot fulfill a safe haven role. In the past, this argument used to stand. Bitcoin volatility fluctuated between 50% and 140% in 2017-2020, but has since been on a steady downward trend. Since 2023, it has been ranging from 23% to 65%, making it comparable to equities and even gold. For context, the VIX (S&P 500 volatility index) has been 16-33% in recent years. The GVZ (CBOE gold volatility index) was 10-30%. As bitcoin adoption and its market cap grow, analysts expect the coin to experience fewer dramatic price swings. Bitcoin volatility from 2017 to 2024 compiled by The Block Skeptics also argue that bitcoin’s performance in past crises casts doubt on its reliability as a safe haven. At the peak of U.S. inflation in May-June 2022, when the Fed began raising rates aggressively, BTC dropped 55%. At the same time, risk-on equities of the S&P 500 fell by 15%, and the risk-off gold fell only by 6%. Market stress usually determines whether an asset is risk-on or risk-off. From this view, bitcoin has failed the test. However, it’s important to consider factors unique to the crypto market. In May 2022, the algorithmic Terra collapsed dramatically, wiping out $50 billion in valuation. Though not directly related to bitcoin, Terra’s crash caused significant reputational and financial damage to the crypto ecosystem, triggering a wave of bankruptcies. Another bitcoin particularity is its four-year halving cycle, which also affects its price dynamics. As investors grow more discerning, bitcoin may be seen as a standalone asset, less affected by the broader crypto market’s turbulence. Billionaire investors appear to have already grasped bitcoin’s subtleties and its potential as a hedge against inflation. Once an outspoken skeptic, Larry Fink now believes that "bitcoin is asset class in itself," considering it an alternative to other commodities like gold." Thus, he thinks that the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Under Larry Fink’s guidance, BlackRock’s bitcoin spot ETF has accumulated $28 billion in assets. In the words of the firm’s Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnik, bitcoin is an “emerging global monetary alternative." It is a “scarce, global, decentralized, non-sovereign asset” with no country-specific or counterparty risk. Mr. Mitchnik believes that these properties make bitcoin fundamentally different from risk-on assets. Paul Tudor Jones is even more direct: "I'm long gold. I'm long bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously under-owned, so I'm long commodities." As to Stanley Druckenmiller, he famously said in 2023: “I don’t own bitcoin, but I should.” It is unknown if the legendary investor owns any coins today. However, he did say that crypto could play a big role in a renaissance because "people just aren't going to trust the central banks." Whether bitcoin can truly hedge inflation is a question only time can answer. Unlike short-term investments, inflation hedges need decades to prove their effectiveness. So far, bitcoin has beaten inflation: in the past ten years, the U.S. dollar lost 33%, while BTC gained 22,208%. Whether this continues is anyone’s guess, but it seems as if Wall Street has made its decision. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: There’s No Way To Reach The Top Of Hollywood’s Corporate Ladders Because The Boomers Already There Won’t Leave

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter That promotion isn’t happening. Forget that raise. And your Boomer boss isn’t vacating that corner office anytime soon. Inside Hollywood’s Great Malaise. By Mia Galuppo Film Writer If you’re planning on attending Tom Rothman’s party in November, you’ll need a costume. Rumor has it the Sony chairman is asking invitees to the event — which is a joint birthday bash with his wife, actress Jessica Harper — to dress up as characters from movies made under his reign. Luckily, it’s a long list of wardrobe choices, stretching back a multitude of decades. You could go as Jack Dawson from 1997’s Titanic. Or Satine from 2001’s Moulin Rouge! Or Miranda Priestly from 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada. Or Rick Dalton from 2019’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Related Stories Movies How Janelle Monáe Became the Queen of Halloween Business Alex Cooper Is Blowing Up: "I'm a Motherf***er When It Comes to Business" The point here is, Rothman is turning 70 and has been in charge at Sony (and before that, Fox) for a very, very long time. As it happens, he’s not the only silver mogul in Hollywood these days. Bob Iger is 73 and has been running Disney off and on for nearly 20 years. Ari Emanuel, 63, has been running WME for nearly 30 years, since he started his agency in 1995 (after starting in the mail room at CAA, the company co-founded by then-28-year-old Michael Ovitz in 1975). Jeremy Zimmer, 66, has been running UTA for more than 30 years, since he co-founded that agency in 1991. Michael De Luca is a relative spring chicken at 59, but he’s been fronting studio slates — at New Line, MGM, Amazon and Warner Bros. — for three decades. Many of these no-longer-so-young Turks are now old enough to qualify for AARP discounts. But few of them seem in any huge rush to retire. And that’s the problem. Or at least it is for a new generation of ambitious show-business strivers under the age of 50 who find themselves unhappily stuck on the middle rungs of Hollywood’s corporate ladder. Unlike their bosses, some of whom ascended to the heights of authority in their 30s (Emanuel) and even their late 20s (De Luca), young professionals today — who are toiling in an industry plagued with title deflation and ever-diminishing paydays — see no clear path to the top. Not one that isn’t blocked by an all-powerful boomer who’s been perched in a corner office since the Bush administration. The first one. “These people have been making movies since the 1990s,” notes one 50-something former head of production. “That’s a long time to have a position of authority and to be a gatekeeper of cultural decisions.” “It’s become so fucking depressing,” agrees a veteran agent, also in his 50s. “Even 10 years ago, executives were like movie stars. They were making tons of movies and were empowered to be bold and do cool things. Now, most executives can’t even hire writers without asking their boss.” Of course, a lot of these bosses are still bosses for good reasons. Rothman, for one, can hog credit for more than 150 Oscar nominations for movies made during his long tenure at Sony. Many of these sexagenarians have built empires from the ground up, guided their companies through mergers, spinoffs and acquisitions, and have skillfully steered their workforces through an ever-revolving series of corporate overlords. They’ve not only proved they have staying power — they’ve proved there’s power in staying. Still, fair or not, there’s a mounting resentment among young (or young-er) Hollywood. Speaking (mostly off the record) with studio executives, producers, agents, assistants — dozens of entertainment industry professionals ranging from their 20s to their 60s — there’s a wide consensus that the kids aren’t alright. Many younger execs feel they’re spinning their wheels, going nowhere — and not even particularly fast — with increasing numbers abandoning Hollywood altogether and decamping for careers in other trades (like, gasp, data analytics). Obviously, there are myriad reasons for the malaise gripping the town — the lingering aftereffects of the pandemic, the industry-wide economic shrinkage, the labor unrest, the waves and waves of layoffs. But a lot of young executives also are casting weary glances at the aging eminences who’ve been occupying Hollywood’s C-suites seemingly forever. The time has come, you can all but hear them rumbling, to start handing out gold watches. *** You’re a 37-year-old mid-level studio exec. You wake up in Hollywood in the year of our Bryan Lourd, 2024. From bed, you check your email and find the latest gloomy blasts from the trades: another 15 percent staff reduction at Paramount Global, and Disney is planning about 300 more layoffs. There’s also an email from a former exec you used to do business with, and you almost scroll past it, at first not recognizing their personal Gmail. Lately, there have been a lot of emails from personal accounts as people shed their corporate addresses or, more likely, as those corporations shed them. This one is a victim from one of the layoffs that happened three or six months prior, you can’t remember which, but you are confident that the quarterly earnings report claimed profitability. They are hoping to take you out to coffee in their latest go around town to see if anywhere is hiring. You thought you had heard they went into real estate, but it must have been someone else. You’ve considered jumping careers yourself, even researched a couple of grad schools, but that was before they finally gave you the promotion they had been talking about since before the strikes. The pay bump wasn’t what you imagined, but you got equity. Or was it that they traded some of your salary for stock? It doesn’t matter, you are barely making what it takes to afford the mortgage on the $1.2 million median home price in Los Angeles County, but it convinced you to hang on for another year. Sunk cost is supposed to be a fallacy, but what do you know? You didn’t get past the home screen for that online MBA program. You are fast approaching 40, living the current reality of the Hollywood dream, and you just want to go back to bed. Of course, it was not always this way. Back in 1986, the Los Angeles Times ran a story headlined “Baby Mogul Running Fast for Fox.” It was about a 28-year-old whiz kid — maybe you’ve heard of him, Scott Rudin? — who had just taken over as president of production at 20th Century Fox, where he was overseeing releases like Penny Marshall’s Big and the Coen brothers’ Raising Arizona. The story laid out the ages of the other heads of the then-eight major Hollywood studios, including Disney’s chairman, Jeff Katzenberg, who was just 35 at the time. And that was Katzenberg’s second job as studio chief; he’d been all of 31 when he got hired to run Paramount. The median age of the presidents of production of the majors in 1986 was 35. “They were who I had in my head when I started in Hollywood,” says a current studio executive in his 50s of these former wunderkinds. “Now that I’ve got here, it’s the worst time to have this job.” Less than a decade after Rudin took over at Fox, De Luca bested him by a year, getting hired at age 27 as New Line’s president of production in 1993. De Luca didn’t have greenlight authority back then, but he had the next best thing — the ear and backing of New Line chairman Bob Shaye. “I walked into [Shaye’s office] with a 170-page epic on porn in the ’70s and a guy with a 13-inch penis,” De Luca once recalled his pitch for Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights. “And he was fine with it.” Today, it’s hard to imagine any 20-something having that kind of clout in Hollywood. Or even a 30-something. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine De Luca, now co-chair and CEO of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, greenlighting a Boogie Nights-like screenplay brought to him by an underling. According to younger execs, that’s precisely what’s wrong with the industry in 2024: It’s still being run by the same people who ran it in 1994. “You look at Mike De Luca, who goes from MGM to Amazon over to Warner Bros. You look at Tom Rothman, who goes from Fox to Sony. These same people are being recycled, and because they’re being recycled, there’s less opportunity for the people under them to be given a shot,” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts (and a former THR editor). “And giving them a shot now seems high-risk.” It’s not just graying studio chiefs who are stubbornly clinging to their jobs; the layers of execs beneath them — the executive vps and those under them, and also those under them — also are sticking in jobs for longer. Who can blame them? Right now, there aren’t a whole lot of other jobs out there. Meanwhile, the cost of retirement continues to rise, especially for those accustomed to a certain Hollywood lifestyle. People are living longer; health care and home care have never been more expensive. There’s every reason to stay put, if you can. “The challenges in sustaining yourself in Hollywood have become greater,” notes a 50-something producer. “So, you hold on for dear life.” The word a lot of folks in the business banter about is “contraction.” But what comes right after is in some ways an even scarier word: “stagnation.” *** If the upshot of all this were merely the shattered career dreams of a bunch of Gen X and millennial movie executives, this story probably wouldn’t have been written. But the implications for the film business — and for the wider cinematic culture — are actually pretty profound, at least according to many of the Gen X and millennial movie executives with whom THR spoke. “It’s a massive problem that the people in power are so far away from Gen Z,” says a mid-30s producer. “They show up for movies when they have something that speaks to them, but whenever they happen upon something that appeals to Gen Z, it feels like they just stepped on a rake.” “You get to a point where you’re living in your beautiful house in the hills, you’re meeting only other wealthy people and you’re not connecting to the audience,” adds Galloway. “And the moviegoing audience is primarily young, so at a certain point you become really detached from them.” Which explains why so much of what Hollywood is producing these days feels so familiar. For instance, there are currently remakes or sequels in development for ’80s classics like An Officer and a Gentleman, Ghost and Dirty Dancing — projects that have little or no emotional resonance to anyone under 50. Obviously, remakes have long been a studio staple. But a War of the Roses redo? A new Running Man offering? It’s unclear whether these nostalgia plays will be all that appealing even to people over 50. Meanwhile, younger executives, especially from underrepresented communities, are navigating studios that are still overwhelmingly white and male, and finding it increasingly difficult to get attention for projects outside of a four-quadrant family film. “[Studios] hired all these mission-driven people of color who now can’t make their passion projects,” says one 30-something agent. “Now, everyone wants Yellowstone.” “Boomers tend to value their own opinions, and they all validate each other,” says a studio executive in their 40s. “They built these systems to just take care of each other. There is no trust with anyone other than themselves.” To be fair, it’s not just boomer bosses who are distrustful these days. There’s been a general trend toward top-down management at many of the studios and even streamers, and it has little to do with age. Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria — who is only 53 — has sat in on humble pitch meetings, something that used to be considered well below her title’s pay grade. As the industry contracts — and stagnates — it becomes more and more risk-averse, with those in charge hoarding their power rather than sharing it with fresh talent coming up through the ranks, in essence starving the next generation of the experience necessary to grow beyond their current titles. (Also, for that matter, starving the town of personality.) “The business used to be a little more batshit crazy,” notes a former production president. “Everyone used to be a lunatic. Now it feels a little more polite. A little more suit-y. Not that people are wearing suits.” Stapler-throwing aside, Hollywood’s more freewheeling ways did tend to yield extraordinary content. Film executives used to make their mark by championing idiosyncratic projects, sometimes putting their careers on the line to do so, then using that win — if there was one — to catapult themselves to their next title or another studio. That doesn’t happen so much anymore. In the age of the plug-and-play franchise, it’s become harder for executives to stand out. And even when they do, it doesn’t always guarantee a promotion. For instance, Nathan Samdahl, the production exec who brought in and oversaw the original horror film Smile, was laid off at Paramount Global in a 2022 cost-cutting effort — just before the movie went on to become one of the studio’s most profitable of the year. (Samdahl eventually found a new home at Walter Hamada’s production banner.) Stagnation, of course, isn’t just rough on those in first class; turbulence is always worse at the back of the plane. The old route to mogul used to start in the mail room — where Emanuel began his journey — but these days even landing a junior job is a lot harder than it used to be. Galloway notes that Chapman University’s career center has clocked a dip of 30 percent in entry-level gigs over the past year. Those few lucky enough to snag an assistant gig often find themselves working even longer hours than their predecessors did, assigned to multiple desks, earning somewhere between $21 to $25 an hour with lessening chances of advancement. All this career inertia isn’t just bad for Hollywood’s younger workforce. In the long run, it’s bad for the future of the business. In fact, it’s potentially deadly. It means that someday, maybe soon, there won’t be anybody left in Hollywood’s dwindling workforce who’ll have a clue about how to run a set. Or a slate. Or a studio. Says one 50-something former studio exec of the looming brain-drain crisis, “It’s an existential threat.” What’s the way forward? How do we find our way out of this stagnation quagmire? Maybe Hollywood, never one for original ideas on or off the screen, should look backward, to the earliest days of the film business. One role model for yesterday’s whiz kid turned today’s silver mogul might be David O. Selznick, who became RKO’s head of production in 1931, at age 29, went on to make Gone With the Wind, Rebecca, Spellbound, A Star Is Born and a slew of other enduring classics, then abruptly stopped making movies and functionally retired in 1948 because, as he put it, “I was tired.” He was 46.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Bezos And Griffin Weigh In (Updated)

Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 83 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): In a strongly worded editorial in the Bezos-owned Washington Post, the centibillionaire explained his decision to reportedly strike down the newspaper’s endorsement of Harris amid a storm of controversy, explaining he believed it would help restore the public’s faith in the paper’s journalism. “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” wrote Bezos. Ken Griffin: Griffin (Citadel) confirmed he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): Griffin, one of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in the world and one of the deepest-pocketed Republican donors in prior election years, told Bloomberg financial markets’ “expectation today is that Donald Trump will win the White House,” echoing a chorus of Wall Street money flows seemingly pricing in such a scenario. But regardless of who wins, “the reduction of uncertainty is almost positive for asset prices and we’re at that moment of peak uncertainty,” offering a positive prognostication for investors. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison: Ellison is one of the most surprising billionaires who has stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering he has donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), in the primaries. A total of 83 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: The news outlet Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. (Updated Oct. 28): Bloomberg donated another $50 million to the same non-profit organization backing Harris, the Times reported Monday. Bloomberg was already the most prolific individual donor to Harris groups this cycle, and his total financial commitment toward Democratic causes now reportedly approaches nearly $100 million. Also, Duolingo founder Luis von Ahn endorsed Harris, declaring the Democratic candidate is “the better option for the US economy.” (Updated Oct. 30): Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former Republican governor of California, said he will vote for the Harris/Walz ticket in a lengthy social media post. Noting he has “plenty of disagreements” with Harris’ platform, Schwarzenegger slammed fellow celebrity-turned-politican Trump as “un-American,” declaring another Trump presidency would bring “four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.” A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

NEXT | Does the Pre-Release Tavern Brawl add enough value to Blizzard's He... World of Warcraft’s 20th Anniversary Celebration is well underway, and if you’re hoping to acquire all of the collectible items from the event then you’ve got your work cut out for you. It will cost you nearly 500 Bronze Celebration Tokens if you want to snag all of the mounts, pets, toys, and cosmetics. Luckily, the event currency rewards for many quests and activities has been significantly increased from the amounts given at the start of the event. We’re talking a 400-800% boost from week one, which should allow players to earn all the bronze they need without spending the next two full months trudging to Tanaris at every log-in.The blue post that came along with the drop rate buff explains that players should be able to get all the tokens they need by playing the content they enjoy. The result is that a massive amount of event currency drops from all of the weekly activities in The War Within. You can earn easy tokens from these events, now in higher quantities:10 for Weekly Quests in Dornogal – Delves, Call of the Worldsoul, Archive, Bonus Holiday weekly8 for the weekly activities around Khaz Algar – that’s the Theater Troupe, Awakening the Machine, Spreading the Light, Azj’Kahet Pact, Special Assignments, Khaz Algar world bosses, and Wax Collecting15 for killing Queen Ansurek in Nerub-ar PalaceIf you’re not opposed to switching over to your PVP gear, you can also grab 15 tokens from the Conquest and Rated PVP weekly and 8 from the Honor, War Mode, and Brawl weeklies.If you’re interested in the rewards but not the celebration itself, it is now possible to set foot in the event grounds just once — to spend all of the Bronze Celebration Tokens that you acquired back on Khaz Algar over several weeks of running end-game content that you were going to do anyway. However, you can speed things up by actually participating in the activities outside of the Caverns of Time.There is just the one daily quest, Celebrate Good Fun!, which rewards 3 tokens. There are also several weekly event quests, each of which also rewards 3 tokens:Event World BossesChromie’s CodexClassic Timewalking DungeonsDefeating Emperor Thaurissan in Blackrock DepthsEarning 500 Honor in Korrak’s RevengeOnce you have earned 100 tokens across all sources, you’ll unlock the Token Collector achievement. This will enable further tokens to drop from the repeatable event activities, including:Classic Timewalking Dungeon completionsTimewalking Blackrock Depths bossesEvent World BossesCodex of Chromie competitionsDaily quests in Korrak’s RevengeIn essence, the new buffs to the currency drop rate take the edge off of getting your first 100 tokens. There isn’t one best strategy for getting all of the bronze you’ll need as quickly as possible. Instead, you can keep to your play style and still earn enough currency for a respectable amount of anniversary souvenirs without getting stuck in a months-long event grind.Is the 20th anniversary celebration not really your thing? Just make sure you keep up on your Khaz Algar weekly checklist. Take advantage of the experience boost to level some alts, and don’t forget things you might have started skipping over if you’ve already out-geared the rewards (like Special Assignments). Well before the end of the event you’ll have enough bronze saved up to buy out the event vendors.Do you need a break from spelunking through the same old weekly activities from The War Within? Once you collect your first 100 tokens, it will be much easier to feel like you’re earning enough event currency just by timewalking, slaying out-of-time world bosses, and helping Chromie repair the damage from her timeway shenanigans (yet again).Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: 20th Anniversary, Bronze Celebration Token, Weekly Rewards, World Of Warcraft 20th AnniversaryAdvertisement The blue post that came along with the drop rate buff explains that players should be able to get all the tokens they need by playing the content they enjoy.

Title: BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $30 billion, sets new record in 293 days

Full Content:
BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit $30 billion in assets setting a new record of 293 days, showcasing rising interest in crypto investments. The milestone from BlackRock comes 10 months after the company launched its spot Bitcoin ETF in January. Then, it was reported that BlackRock had traded $7.5 million shares within the first 10 minutes of launching. Now, BlackRock holds more than 417,000 Bitcoin, valued at $30.4 billion, according to iShares data. Taking to X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, said what BlackRock has achieved is an “all-time record,” adding “the old record was $JEPI which did it in 1,272 days. $GLD took 1,790 days. Unreal.” Also $IBIT has crossed the $30 billion mark in assets after monster flows and price appreciation yesterday. It hit this milestone in just 293 days, an all time record. The old record was $JEPI which did it in 1,272 days. $GLD took 1,790 days. Unreal… pic.twitter.com/rUskhqhW7b — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 30, 2024 Balchunas also noted that Bitcoin ETFs could reach one million Bitcoin soon. At the time of publishing, the number sits around 983,000. If such a milestone is reached Balchunas believes that the combined spot Bitcoin ETFs could surpass Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet, which holds 1.1 Bitcoin, by mid-December. “That said, anything can happen, eg a violent selloff and all this is delayed albeit still inevitable,” he added. “On flip, if prices keep going up, Trump wins, we could see FOMO could kick in and it all happens faster. Stay tuned.” COUNTDOWN: US spot ETFs are scheduled to hit 1 million bitcoin held by next Wed and pass Satoshi by mid-December (before their first birthday, amazing). They've been adding about 17k btc a week.

Title: What Wall Street Thinks of Meta Platforms Stock Ahead of Earnings

Time Published: 2024-10-30T14:30:52Z
Full Content:
Shares of Meta Platforms (META) ticked higher in early Wednesday trading ahead of the company's next round of financial results, due after the bell. The results are set to arrive with the company's shares up nearly 70% this year—and Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly bullish on the shares, though at present calling for comparatively little further update. Of the 30 analysts tracking shares of the Facebook and Instagram parent company as of Wednesday morning, 28 had "buy" or equivalent ratings on the stock and two had "hold," according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts' price targets, meanwhile, ranged from around $500 to $675. The median target, $613.72, represents a premium to Tuesday's close of a bit more than 3%. Meta stock was recently up about 0.3% to just over $595. Meta's results are due on the heels of a report last night from Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), whose shares recently were up about 16% after the company turned in 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the latest quarter and a smaller loss. Here's what you need to know about Meta's coming earnings report.

Title: Super Micro Computer Stock Plummets as EY Resigns as Company's Auditor
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/super-micro-computer-stock-plummets-as-ey-resigns-as-company-auditor-8736619
Time Published: 2024-10-30T14:22:58Z
Full Content:
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged Wednesday after accounting firm EY resigned as the company's auditor following months of speculation about the company's accounting practices. EY, one of the country's "Big Four" accounting firms, told Super Micro Computer's board the decision comes "due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations." EY added it is "unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management." Super Micro Computer said it disagreed with EY's decision, as the audit it hired EY last year to complete isn't done yet, and that it takes the concerns the accounting firm raised about "whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity" seriously. The resignation comes as Super Micro Computer's stock has tumbled in recent months amid speculation about its accounting practices after it delayed the filing of its annual 10-K and a report from short seller Hindenburg Research alleging "accounting manipulation" and other issues. Last month, reports emerged that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into Super Micro Computer's accounting practices following the Hindenburg report. Following EY's resignation, Hindenburg founder Nate Anderson said the firm's letter of resignation is "about as strongly worded as I have seen," and suggested EY's decision could make partners like Nvidia (NVDA) question doing business with Super Micro Computer going forward. Super Micro Computer shares were down nearly 30% in early trading Wednesday at $35.71, though even with Wednesday's losses, they've gained about one-quarter of their value since the start of the year.

Title: Eli Lilly isn't selling as much Zepbound as expected — and the stock is sinking
URL: https://qz.com/eli-lilly-zepbound-q3-1851685072
Time Published: 2024-10-30T13:51:41Z
Full Content:
Sales of Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.34%) blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound are still booming, but just not at the level Wall Street was anticipating. The pharma giant posted its third-quarter earning Wednesday morning and reported sales figures well below analysts’ expectations. This led to the company’s stock falling more than 13% in Wednesday morning trading. “Lilly had another strong growth quarter in Q3, with total revenue increasing by 42% after excluding divestiture activity in the same period last year,” said Eli Lilly CEO David A. Ricks, in a press release. “While the growth of Mounjaro and Zepbound is impressive, we are equally proud of the 17% growth in non-incretin revenue, which includes our oncology, immunology, and neuroscience portfolios, compared with Q3 2023 on the same basis.” Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS+0.98%). Sales of the company’s diabetes drug Mounjaro rose over 120% to $3.1 billion in the third-quarter, compared with $1.4 billion in the same period last year. However, the drug also failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations of nearly $3.8 billion in sales. Zepbound and Mounjaro belong to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Eli Lilly and its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.64%), the maker of competing medications Wegovy and Ozempic, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments.

Title: Netflix Stock Could Fall To $400
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/30/netflix-stock-could-fall-to-400/
Time Published: 2024-10-30T13:38:11Z
Full Content:
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 29: Selena Gomez attends The French American Film Festival Opening ... [+] Night Premiere of Netflix's "Emilia Perez" at DGA Theater Complex on October 29, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic) Netflix stock has had a solid year, rising by almost 60% year-to-date as the company successfully navigated a brief subscriber decline post-Covid-19. This compares to rival Disney, which has gained a mere 5% over the same period. However, despite Netflix’s recent success with its crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its ad-supported streaming option, there are some risks facing the company. Could Netflix’s stock fall to levels of $400 in the next few years, compared to its current level of around $750? It’s possible given Netflix stock’s considerable volatility. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -51% in 2022, and 65% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In this analysis below, we take a closer look at Netflix’s revenues, margins, and earnings multiples to explore a potential scenario where the stock could fall. This serves as a counterpoint to our previous analysis of Netflix Stock: The Road To $1,000. Much like Netflix has revolutionized the entertainment business, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) is disrupting the surgical business: ISRG Stock To $5,000? Netflix’s revenue growth has been on a relatively strong trajectory with sales rising from about $20.16 billion in 2019 to $33.7 in 2023, translating into an annual growth of about 14% each year. Revenues are projected to grow at about 15% in 2024 to almost $39 billion. However, there is a real possibility that growth could slow meaningfully going forward, possibly to low or mid-single-digit levels. Why is that? A bulk of Netflix’s growth in recent quarters has come via strong subscriber growth with the company adding over 50 million subscribers between early January 2023 and September 2024, taking its user base to about 283 million. Netflix started putting restrictions on password-sharing last year, which forced people using someone else’s account to create their own accounts or sign up for paid sharing of accounts to continue using Netflix. While this crackdown on account sharing boosted subscriber numbers, the impact may be short-lived. With the policy now enforced in over 100 countries, there may be relatively limited growth that can come from this avenue. We wouldn’t be surprised if paid sharing pulled forward potential subscribers from outer years, possibly reducing future growth. In fact, Netflix’s paid net additions have been slowing down of late. Paid additions in the U.S. and Canada stood at 0.69 million in Q3, down from 2.5 million in Q1 and about 1.5 million in Q2. Netflix ARPU growth could also falter going forward. Netflix has already raised prices several times in recent years, with its most popular ad-free plan rising from $10 in 2017 to $15.50 today. While Netflix has skillfully monetized users without increasing churn driven by its strong content slate and recently added advertising revenue streams, the competition is mounting. For example, Disney’s streaming bundles, offering Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus for as low as $15 per month, provide stronger value, potentially leading to lower churn and higher sign-ups for Disney. Sure the streaming market isn’t a zero-sum game with many users subscribing to multiple services. However, the increasingly competitive environment, along with a challenging economic outlook and weaker consumer spending, gives Netflix less room to raise prices. Netflix has also avoided raising the price of its standard full-HD plan since its last increase in January 2022, suggesting a relatively cautious approach to pricing. Given the possibility of slower subscriber growth and limited ARPU gains, Netflix’s revenue growth could slow significantly. From an estimated $39 billion in 2024, we see a scenario where growth might only average around 5% over the next three years, bringing total revenue to approximately $45 billion by 2027. Netflix has expanded its net margin from levels of about 9% in 2019 to about 16% in 2023 and margins are projected at about 22% for this year, translating into a net profit of about $8.7 billion led by a higher customer base as well as better cost management. However, costs could tick upward in the coming years. Netflix is also now offering more live content including notable sports programming. Netflix is set to stream Christmas NFL games this year as well as WWE Raw wrestling starting Jan 2025. Sports rights often come with sizable costs and it could take time for Netflix to optimize its cost structure to absorb these expenses, without hitting margins. Moreover, free cash flows have been low or negative for the last several years due to elevated content spending. For example, between 2019 and 2022, Netflix generated a total of less than $300 million in free cash flows for the four years, although the number picked up to over $6.9 billion in 2023 as the strikes by writers and actors reduced the company’s content spending to just about $13 billion in 2023, down from around $17 billion in the previous year. Content spending is expected to pick up again in 2024 to around $17 billion. If content cost pressures persist, while Netflix also faces slowing growth after the big bump from ad-supported plans and paid sharing, there remains a possibility that net margins could fall back to levels of roughly 20%. This could translate into net profits of just about $9 billion by 2027, a mere 3% higher than projected 2024 levels. At the current stock price of about $750 per share, Netflix trades at around 37x forward earnings, which appears expensive in our view. Although Netflix’s recent performance has been strong, markets tend to be short-sighted, extrapolating short-term successes for the long run. In Netflix’s case, the assumption is that the company will continue its strong streak of subscriber additions and likely grow revenues comfortably at double digits. However, there’s a real possibility that Netflix will soon see subscriber growth cool, as the twin benefit of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers is likely to eventually stabilize. If Netflix’s P/E multiple declines to levels of about 20x by 2027, with potential net earnings of about $9 billion calculated previously, this would translate into a market capitalization of about $180 billion, or a little over $400 per share. Now while such a decline in P/E multiple may appear drastic, Netflix stock typically reacts very sharply to news. The stock has seen drawdowns of over 70% in a matter of a couple of months, like the sell-off that came between October 2021 and May 2022 when the company witnessed a post-Covid slowdown. What about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the scenario plays out, with Netflix seeing slower subscriber adds coupled with stalling ARPU growth, the stock could see a meaningful correction.

Title: Bitcoin nears all-time high, but THIS concern rises – Is a pullback likely?

If investors cash out, BTC’s bull rally can likely lose momentum. Bitcoin [BTC] is on the verge of making history yet again in 2024. AMBCrypto recently reported that this week would be crucial for dictating BTC’s prospects, determining whether it would align with the cyclical trend and climb higher or lean toward the monetary outlook and decline. Well, looks like the king coin has taken the former path. On the 29th of October, the leading cryptocurrency surged past the crucial $70,000 mark, for the first time since June. It reached a peak of $73,620 on Binance—just over a hundred dollars shy of its all-time high of $73,777. At press time, BTC was exchanging hands at $72,350, up by approximately 2% over the past day. This impressive rally reignited bullish sentiment among investors. Yet, it also raised a pressing question: Will this breakthrough trigger a wave of profit-taking? Recent activity suggests potential sell-offs may be underway. According to Lookonchain, following Bitcoin’s surge past $71,000, a whale wallet holding 749 BTC (worth $53.23 million) became active after remaining dormant for 12 years. This whale originally accumulated BTC back in 2012 when Bitcoin was priced at just $11, totaling an investment of $8,151 at the time. Now, it has transferred out 159 BTC ($11.32 million). Another major player potentially preparing to cash out is the Government of Bhutan. Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that crypto wallets linked to Bhutan’s Royal Government moved $66.55 million worth of BTC to Binance. Notably, their last exchange deposit was four months ago, in early July. At the time of writing, Bhutan held 12.47K BTC, valued at $904.34 million. Source: Arkham Intelligence While sell-offs loom, BlackRock remained firmly committed to Bitcoin. As noted by Lookonchain, the asset management giant purchased another 4,528 BTC worth over $322 million on 28th October. Furthermore, in the past two weeks, BlackRock significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, adding 34,085 BTC to its portfolio. This addition was valued at approximately $2.3 billion. The latest purchase brought its holdings to 408,253 BTC, valued at a staggering $29.09 billion, signaling strong institutional interest in the asset. Despite Bitcoin’s remarkable price performance, retail appeared to be sleeping on the asset. Google Trends data revealed that search interest for “Bitcoin” scored just 17 out of 100, last week. At press time, the value was slightly up at 23. Source: Google Trends Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s latest report indicated that retail participation was overshadowed by larger investors. While retail investors were gradually re-entering the market, their holdings, however, were growing at an unusually slow rate. Additionally, Bitcoin transfer activity among retail investors remained relatively low. Daily transfers totaled just $326 million on September 21, marking the lowest level since at least 2020. Historically, low transfer activity by retail investors often precedes price rallies for Bitcoin, a trend seemingly playing out now. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Therefore, as Bitcoin approaches record highs, the interplay between whales, institutes, and retail could shape its short-term trajectory—one that may set the stage for either unprecedented highs or a profit-taking pause.

Patronis champions Bitcoin as a hedge and diversifier for Florida pensions, aligning with DeSantis's anti-CBDC stance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has urged the State Board of Administration (SBA) to consider adding Bitcoin to the state pension funds. On Oct. 29, Patronis sent a letter to Chris Spencer, the executive director of the Florida State Board of Administration, highlighting Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold.” He emphasized how Bitcoin could diversify the state’s portfolio while offering a protective hedge against the volatility of other major asset classes. Patronis stressed that protecting the financial stability of Florida’s pension funds for teachers, police officers, and firefighters requires securing the best possible returns. He argued that Bitcoin could be a strategic addition, offering a compelling opportunity within the crypto sector. The CFO pointed out that his proposal aligns with Governor Ron DeSantis’s stance against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which contrasts with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to him: “[Bitcoin] is the antithesis of a central currency, providing decentralized digital currencies managed on blockchain technology, not issued or controlled by any government agency.” Considering this, Patronis asked the SBA to prepare a report analyzing the feasibility, risks, and benefits of investing state retirement funds into Bitcoin. He suggested that this report would help lawmakers make informed decisions ahead of the next legislative session. Patronis added: “The State Board of Administration maintains a Florida Growth Fund that allows for more innovative and emerging investments, and a Digital Currency Investment Pilot Program could be a perfect fit, offering potential benefits we cannot afford to overlook.” As of Jan. 2024, the Florida Growth Fund has authorization to allocate up to 1.5% of the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund toward high-growth investments. This fund invested around $998 million from 2022 through 2023. Patronis noted that other states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, have started investing a small percentage of their pension funds in crypto. Earlier this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board invested $164 million to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offered by Grayscale and BlackRock. Similarly, the State of Michigan Retirement System owns around $6.6 million shares in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Eli Lilly Stock Tumbles as Q3 Sales, Profits Fall Well Short of Estimates

Eli Lilly (LLY) shares tumbled 12% at the opening bell Wednesday after its third-quarter results fell well short of analysts' estimates and it lowered its full-year guidance. The pharmaceutical giant registered $11.44 billion in revenue—above last year's $9.50 billion but below the $12.18 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha—as weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound continue to boost Eli Lilly's sales. However, analysts were looking for greater sales of the blockbuster drugs. Lilly swung to a profit of $970.3 million, or $1.07 per share, but still well below the $1.69 billion and $1.87 per share analysts were looking for. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 was barely half of the $2.18 expected. Lilly lowered its 2024 earnings per share (EPS) guidance to a range of $12.05 to $12.55 from $15.10 to $15.60, and adjusted EPS to $13.02 to $13.52 from $16.10 to $16.60. These were both driven by the $2.83 billion acquired in-progress research and development (IPR&D) charges incurred in Q3. Lilly also lowered the top of its full-year revenue range to $46.0 billion from $46.6 billion. Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NVO)—which has its own blockbuster drugs in Ozempic and Wegovy—have spent billions on a variety of acquisitions to help ramp up production of their weight-loss medications. Surging sales for the weight-loss drugs have boosted Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's results over the last several quarters. Eli Lilly said sales of Mounjaro more than doubled year-over-year to $3.11 billion, while Zepbound produced $1.26 billion in quarterly sales as it approaches its one-year anniversary of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. However, analysts were looking for $3.69 billion in Mounjaro revenue and $1.71 billion in Zepbound sales. Eli Lilly shares, which had been up more than 50% since the start of the year through Tuesday's close, fell 12% to $792.42 at the opening bell. Novo Nordisk stock fell more than 3%.

Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner Influence Media Partners. Influence Media Partners, founded in 2019 by Lylette Pizarro, is revolutionizing music rights management by investing in and actively managing high-value music catalogs of diverse artists. The company differentiates itself through strategic partnerships, a focus on diversity, and active management of music properties to enhance value and promote artists' legacies. Pizarro's extensive experience and understanding of the evolving music rights landscape led to the company's formation. Influence Media Partners has secured $750 million in funding from prominent entities like BlackRock and Warner Music Group, enabling its expansion. Since its inception, the company has grown substantially, expanded its portfolio across diverse genres, and launched new ventures like SLANG, a frontline label focused on nurturing emerging talent . NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - SEPTEMBER 18: Stevie Frasure, Lylette Pizarro, Ben Vaughn, Jesse Frasure, ... [+] Spencer Nohe, Lynn Hazan and Phil May attend the Jesse Frasure Return to Calm Springs Listening Experience in Partnership with Rhythm House, Influence Media Partners and Warner Chappell at Soho House Nashville on September 18, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee. Influence Media Partners is disrupting the music industry by not just investing in but actively managing high-value music catalogs and has raised $750 million for two funds and is currently raising for its third fund. Founder Pizarro is a seasoned music and entertainment strategist who gained extensive experience working with Fortune 50 companies. In her role at RPM, she negotiated transformative music partnerships with artists, record labels, and songwriters. Influence Media focuses on diverse artists with the potential to create enduring cultural impact. The firm targets active artists and songwriters with a history of engaging their fans and creating music across various genres who want to continue building their legacy and intellectual property. ““Lylette is a force that brings a sense of power and prestige to a songwriter in my shoes,” describes Nicolle Galyon, Grammy Nominated singer, songwriter and producer. “Having her invested in my copyrights and my creativity gives me a posture that I didn’t previously have.” For many folks investing in music, “it is just a buy and sell strategy," Pizarro explained. "The way Influence has thought about it is invest and build—invest, partner, and build. We're in constant dialog with the managers and artists directly, and thinking about new ways to unlock value, which is truly different to the marketplace." This commitment to partnership and building value sets Influence Media apart. Rather than simply acquiring catalogs and waiting for returns, the company leverages its team's expertise to actively enhance the value of its music properties through strategic marketing and brand building. This approach, combined with a strong emphasis on diversity and strategic alliances, has enabled the company to identify a unique position in the industry. Pizarro's deep understanding of the evolving music rights landscape honed over 20 years in the business, has been key to the company's success. She recognized a shift in the market and saw an opportunity to build a new platform that champions the artists and holds their catalogs. Influence Media’s unique approach has attracted significant investment from industry heavyweights like Warner Music Group. "Lylette has a fresh and thoughtful approach to acquiring and working culturally and commercially impactful catalogs which is delivering real results,” said Temi Adeniji, Managing Director of Warner Music Africa and SVP of Sub-Saharan Africa at Warner. “We're collaborating on exciting projects with artists as varied as Enrique Iglesias, Future, and Tainy, who have all placed their trust in Lylette and her team to help build their musical legacies." The firm also attracted investment from BlackRock. “Lylette's vision for the industry, ability to create meaningful and long-lasting relationships, and unyielding work ethic underpin her success,” explained Paul Braude, chief investment officer and head, direct private opportunities at BlackRock. These partnerships provide crucial financial backing and strategic support, enabling the company to expand its portfolio and reach. Warner Music Group, in particular, was instrumental in establishing early credibility and trust for the first-time fund. Since its launch, Influence Media has achieved remarkable growth. The company has secured $750 million in funding, expanded its portfolio across diverse genres with catalogs from artists like Enrique Iglesias and Blake Shelton, and launched new ventures like SLANG, a frontline label and publisher focused on artist development. Slang has signed Will Smith, Future, Truththebull and RaiNao along with Grammy-winning producers such as 30 Roc and Camper who have worked with the likes of Big Sean, Mary J. Blige, Cardi B, and Roddy Ricch. Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner at Influence Media Partners, Lex Borrero, a ... [+] prominent music executive, producer, and co-founder of NEON16, and Melissa Vargas, Brand Manager at Parkwood Entertainment attend Influence Media toasts René McLean at GRAMMY Week at The Maybourne Beverly Hills on February 02, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. Fundraising for a new venture is always challenging, and Influence Media was no exception. The team pitched their vision to 200 investors, a testament to their dedication and perseverance. As a first-time fund manager, Pizarro lacked the established track record that institutional investors typically seek, making the process even more difficult. To overcome this, she strategically assembled a team with a unique blend of expertise in both music finance and traditional investment. This ensured that her strategy was clearly articulated and her execution plan was solid, increasing the confidence of potential investors. The Influence Media management team boasts a wealth of experience besides Pizarro’s. Co-managing partner Lynn Hazan brings 25 years of experience as CFO at Sony Music Group, while partner Rene McLean has a strong background and creative experience in music and entertainment strategy and licensing. Founding advisor and investor Jon Jashni offers expertise in media investment and content production while Danny Klotz, head of underwriting, possesses deep experience in finance and analytics. “Making sure that the investment team was both a mix of music FP&A [financial planning and analysis] and classic investor DNA was critical,” Pizarro explained. This diverse team was laser-focused on strategically investing in music rights, differentiating themselves in a crowded marketplace filled with institutional capital. Their strong point of view on recorded music and songwriter rights, combined with a clear articulation of their strategy, helped them stand out. Pizarro also had to overcome the hurdle of being a woman and a minority—Latina—in a predominantly male industry. “Her [Lylette] drive is matched only by her passion for music and by the care she has for those around her, whether it be the team she has built at Influence, the partners for whom she delivers or the artists with whom she partners, said Pam Chan, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Mosaic at Lingotto.” Influence Media is a diverse company, with women and minorities comprising a significant portion of its leadership. “We were 66% female leadership and 66% diverse,” Pizarro shared. Perhaps because of this, Pizarro and her team faced skepticism and questions about their ability to succeed. However, they persevered and ultimately secured major investments. “Ultimately, we found the right partners, and they have been fantastic partners to us,” Pizarro affirmed. These strategic partnerships not only provided financial backing but also enhanced the firm's credibility, demonstrating to other investors that Influence Media could achieve its ambitious goals. Warner Music Group's involvement, in particular, signaled trust and credibility, while BlackRock's investment brought significant financial weight and further solidified the company's industry standing.

October 30, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Oct. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from 10 diamond drill holes completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. These results are part of Radisson’s ongoing 35,000 metre drill program. The ten drill holes reported today represent both shallow and deep drilling on the Project’s mineralized “Trend #s 0, 1 and 2.” Included are two wedges performed on the deep drill hole OB-24-324, which returned 27.61 g/t gold over 6.0 metres with extensive visible gold at a depth 170 metres below the base of the existing Mineral Resource on “Trend #1” (see Radisson News Release dated September 24, 2024). Also reported today are results from drill hole OB-24-323 which represents a 100-metre step-out below the base of the Mineral Resource on “Trend #0.” The new data, taken together, continue to demonstrate the extension of high-grade O’Brien mineralization to depth, where it remains open. Results Highlights: Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “Today’s drill results continue to demonstrate the type of narrow high-grade intercepts within broader mineralized envelopes that are so characteristic of the O’Brien Gold Project. The drill holes reported today represent a balance between shallower targets within the existing Mineral Resource model, and deeper step-outs geared to new discovery. This reflects the drilling priorities set in May when our 2024 program was expanded to 35,000 metres; however, we are becoming increasingly focused on the deep expansion potential of O’Brien. Recall that DDH OB-24-324, released in September, returned almost an ounce of gold over 6 metres core length at 1,100 metres vertical depth, 170 metres below previous drilling. For context, approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. Now, wedges drilled from this hole, and a step out hole 100 metres below the Mineral Resource on Trend #0, are giving more high-grade intercepts at previously untested depths. Three rigs are currently active, with one rig committed to drilling directly beneath the historic O’Brien mine for the first time in the Project’s history. This pilot hole is expected to be more than 1,600 metres in length and will test for gold mineralization more than 400 metres beneath the deepest mine workings. Success with this hole offers to dramatically change the potential scope of the Project.” Table 1: Summary Assay Results from Today’s Drill Holes Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 MRE. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Table 2 presents additional drill intercepts calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length, so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Drill holes OB-24-324W2 and 329 did not return any intercepts averaging above 3.00 g/t Au. Assay results for drill holes OB-24-327 and 328 are pending. Lithology Codes: PON-S3: Pontiac Sediments; V3-S, V3-N, V3-CEN: Basalt-South, North, Central; S1P, S3P: Conglomerate; POR-S, POR-N: Porphyry South, North; TX: Crystal Tuff. Figure 1: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with Today’s Drill Holes Illustrated Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focused on delineating well-developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5,” Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Today’s Drill Results Today’s results are from ten drill holes, including two wedges, over 3,895 metres in Trends # 0, 1 and 2. Visible gold was observed in six of the holes. Holes were drilled on northerly declinations at initial inclinations of between -50 and -80 degrees, providing a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and the vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Drill holes OB-24-324W1 and W2 were wedges drilled off the previously reported, high-grade hole OB-24-324, which had extended Trend #1 170 metres beneath previous drilling with two zones of 27.61 g/t Au over 6.0 metres and 6.83 g/t Au over 10.0 metres, including 40.2 g/t Au over 1.5 metres (Figure 2). Wedge OB-24-324W1 successfully intersected two zones of mineralization immediately above hole 324, with 5.48 g/t Au over 12.4 metres, including 12.10 g/t Au over 4.4 metres, and 8.02 g/t Au over 4.2 metres. Wedge OB-24-324W2 deviated from its intended target eastwards and returned a number of mineralized zones of 1-2 metres in thickness at 1-2 g/t in gold grades (Table 2). Drill holes OB-24-325 to 332 tested targets within the existing vein model in Trend #1, between approximately 200 and 350 metres vertical depth. Of note, OB-24-332 returned 16.21 g/t Au over 5.4 metres, including 32.25 g/t Au over 2.4 metres. Drill hole OB-24-333 was a shallow hole targeting Trend #2 at approximately 200 metres vertical depth, returning 62.0 g/t Au over 1.0 metre. Results are pending for drill holes OB-24-327 and 328. Figure 2: Cross Section of Trend 1 Locating Drill Hole OB-24-324, Wedges OB-24-324W1 and OB-24-324W2, and the Previously Published OB-96-071 and OB-20-174W1B Drill Holes Drill hole OB-24-323 was located approximately 100 metres below drilling on the high-grade Trend #0, immediately adjacent to the O’Brien mine. It returned two broad mineralized zones of 3.34 g/t Au over 10.9 metres, including 13.90 g/t Au over 1.5 metres, and 3.51 g/t Au over 8.2 metres, including 9.93 g/t Au over 1.5 metres. This successfully extends Trend #0 to depth.

Title: DTX Exchange Is Trading Like This Cycle’s Dogecoin, Shocking Similarity Emerges Between 2021 DOGE Chart

While the DTX Exchange attracts attention for its features and prospective profits, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies are generating spectacular gains as the cryptocurrency bull run heats up. As the bull run is about to start, several of the leading cryptocurrencies are already generating net double-digit profits. The massive surge in meme coins is accelerating as the price of Bitcoin surpasses $71,000, and the cryptocurrency market approaches $2.5 trillion. The market value of meme currencies has increased to $62.23 billion with a trading volume of $9.74 billion, with Dogecoin leading the field with a 15% rise over the past day. This largest meme coin has a huge 140% upside, and the other tokens are probably going to provide exponential gains. Here, we will review the best coin for the upcoming spectacular surge in November same as DOGE. Dogecoin was a pioneer in 2021 in the meme coin activity, which later became the multibillion-dollar industry it is today. Dogecoin’s value skyrocketed after Elon Musk’s tweet, hitting its highest peak ever at $0.73. However, will it be able to surpass this level in the next bull run? Although several indicators support Dogecoin breaking its all-time high, analysts are split on the price projection for this cycle. In and of itself, Elon Musk’s affiliation with pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump is a bullish trigger, and Musk could send Dogecoin skyrocketing with a well-timed X tweet. Although the potential for parabolic growth is somewhat limited, Dogecoin, the largest meme, is predicted to profit from many meme rallies over the course of the next 12 months. Since DOGE bounced back from its monthly lows under $0.1, the price volatility has increased. Since then, the volume has continued to climb noticeably, indicating that bulls and other market players are sufficiently involved. As a result, the DOGE price is poised for a further 25% increase that might happen at any moment now that market opinions have changed. Additionally, the 50-day and 200-day EMAs’ golden crossing increases the likelihood of an upward move. By the end of November, Dogecoin is probably going to hit $0.3713 if the upward momentum continues. Another cryptocurrency bull run, like the one that occurred in 2021, is almost upon us. After surpassing popular cryptocurrencies like DOGE, DTX Exchange (DTX) is now at the forefront. The next destination for investments by the crypto community is the current DTX presale. Just a few weeks into the presale period, the new hybrid exchange has already raised an incredible $6.1 million. Additionally, forecasts indicate that DTX Exchange will do something significant if its token is listed on significant cryptocurrency platforms. The duplicate trading tool on DTX Exchange is designed to help traders who are fed up with intricate techniques. You don’t need to be an expert to follow the strategies of successful traders, learn from them, and maybe increase profits. Additionally, DTX Exchange offers a variety of assets for those who are restricted to trading solely cryptocurrency. In one location, you may access tokenized assets, FX, CFDs, and stocks. In this manner, you may use both traditional and digital markets to diversify your portfolio without having to transfer platforms. According to analysts, DTX Exchange’s features and pricing suggest that it will likely follow DOGE’s lead, similar to how it surged in 2021.

Title: Could Political Betting Swing The US Election?

Time Published: 2024-10-30T05:42:45Z
Full Content:
As the 1549 papal conclave dragged on into a second and third month, Venice's ambassador to the Vatican, Matteo Dandolo, was outraged by insider trading. “It is more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll,” he said, “and that the cardinals' attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands.” Although the conclave was supposedly secret, Roman traders ran a thriving market in the streets around the Vatican trying to predict the winner. Odds shifted rapidly, and bettors appeared suspiciously well informed and perceptive. Everyone knew the race was wide open, and the original favorite in the crowded field, at 5-to-1 against (or 17% odds), was Cardinal Giovanni Maria del Monte. Ten weeks later, he was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate, but only after opposing cardinals had brought forward a parade of options. Bettors on the streets helped the population understand who was leading, and by spotting early on that Julius might be the inoffensive candidate who would provoke the least opposition, they even guided the cardinals as they tried to break the deadlock. Prediction markets grew so widespread and so disliked that by the end of the 16th century, Pope Gregory XIV had outlawed them. The penalty for betting on the identity of the next pope was excommunication. Five centuries later, the urge to bet on elections has not abated. Neither has the whiff of corruption surrounding them, nor the sense that bettors' money can move not just markets but election results themselves. For centuries there have been cycles of political betting — in 19th century Pall Mall clubs, and in the early 20th century on the floors of the New York and London stock exchanges — punctuated by moves to ban them. As the 2024 presidential campaign drives towards a bitter conclusion, the cycle is repeating. This time the ultimate authority is not the pope but the US Supreme Court. At present, the US's biggest political betting markets are offshore. The only legal, regulated entities are nonprofits run as academic experiments with tight limits on how much can be wagered — the best known are the Iowa Electronic Markets and PredictIt.com, which operates in the US under the auspices of Victoria University in New Zealand. Now, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is fighting an attempt to set up a legal onshore political futures market, which would allow Americans to take part without limits on how much they can trade. In the latest round, the for-profit Kalshi futures market won a stay against the CFTC's ban that cleared the way for a huge experiment. The litigation could go on for years, but Kalshi can run a market on this year's election, and its odds now appear in huge neon lights above Times Square. This has prompted established brokers to get in on the act; Interactive Brokers also launched political futures trading for the election. The world's richest man is paying attention. Earlier this month, Elon Musk urged his followers on the online platform X, which he owns, to follow the offshore venue Polymarket (launched by his former colleague Peter Thiel). “More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line,” he wrote. At the time, Polymarket showed Donald Trump's chances at 50.1%. Hours later, and with no relevant news, a still-anonymous French investor made the first of a series of giant trades now totaling some $45 million on a Trump win, pushing his odds way up. Ten days later, with Kamala Harris still ahead in polls of polls, Trump's chances had surged to 62.2%. PredictIt, populated mostly by academics limited to stakes of $850, also raised Trump's chances, but at a much slower pace. The press was more interested in Polymarket. Since Musk's tweet it has featured in 10 times more news stories than PredictIt. Polymarket's odds helped change the narrative in markets where far more money is at stake. Treasury yields and share prices both rose, as traders started pricing in a Trump win and the corporate tax cuts that would come with it. The Problem of Reflexivity Like all markets, popular prediction markets are prone to what the hedge fund manager George Soros calls “reflexivity.” Rather than just reflecting or reacting to facts on the ground, moves in bonds, stocks or oil markets can actually change that reality. It is this fear that animates opposition to Kalshi. The pressure group Better Markets, an amicus in the CFTC's suit, asserts that manipulating these markets could shift the facts. Cantrell Dumas, its director of derivatives policy, says that if the markets are taken seriously and show that one candidate is likely to win “people could stay home and not vote for their preferred candidate.” On the other side, Kalshi's supporters argue that manipulation is a problem for all markets, and the key is regulation. David Mason, general counsel of PredictIt and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission argues, “these manipulation problems are dealt with in regulated markets every day. There are trading exclusions; if they have material non-public information then they are prohibited from trading. Kalshi has a long list of people who aren't allowed to trade.” But Dumas rejects the comparison. “In a traditional market, if a regulator sees manipulation and takes action, it has remedies. With election manipulation that changes the result, that's irreparable harm. It's a fundamental distinction,” he told me. The excitement since Musk's tweet looks very much like reflexivity in action. And social change has amplified the potential reflexive power of markets. We are now far more inclined to trust in the “wisdom of crowds.” Most importantly, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, developed in the 1950s and the basis for much modern finance, holds that markets continuously incorporate all information, and so they can't be consistently beaten, except by insiders who know something others don't. Central to the argument for investing passively in indexes and exchange-traded funds, this idea can transmogrify into a belief that markets can't be wrong. Historically, political betting is impressively accurate. The academics Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz demonstrated 20 years ago that over history, markets had come closer to getting presidential elections right (with an average error of 1.5%) than the Gallup poll, which was on average off by 2.1%. Market discipline should help experts thrash out a better consensus estimate, and many companies now run internal prediction markets to improve forecasting. Wikipedia and Google have convinced us that crowd-sourcing information can work, and popular culture is saturated with tales of brilliant statisticians, like Michael Lewis' 2003 book Moneyball on how the Oakland A's used statistics to spot good players others had missed. Nate Silver, an adviser to Polymarket, made his name as a baseball statistician. Then there's what Wall Streeters call the Elaine Garzarelli Effect: We tend to place excessive trust in whichever guru made a good call last time. As a Lehman Brothers investment strategist, Garzarelli brilliantly urged clients to get out of the stock market the week before the Black Monday crash in 1987. That made her one of the most widely quoted strategists on the Street; her words would move markets, and she compiled a good track record. But she was fallible — in December 2007, on the eve of the global financial crisis, she proclaimed that stocks were undervalued by 25% — and people lost interest. In politics, the offshore Intrade prediction market developed a Garzarelli effect after calling 49 states correctly in 2008, and then all 50 — amid much attention — in 2012. Then regulators shut it down, but other venues rose to replace it. The market odds on a Donald Trump victory were about 35% on election night in 2016. Betting markets may also have grown more reflexive because the legalization of sports betting has made gambling socially acceptable, while investing looks ever more like gambling. Baseball banned Shoeless Joe Jackson and Pete Rose for life over wagering on the sport. Now, Major League Baseball has its own formal spread-betting partner. Investment apps now resemble video games: Robinhood.com drove the meme stock craze of 2021 as people poured stimulus checks, and a lot of political anger, into bets on companies like GameStop Corp. While papal envoys disdained people betting in the street, our current society has little problem with people trading elections on their phones. Reflexivity is amplified by a constant of human nature; our psychological need for an anchor. We want a number, and once we have one we cling to it, because it gives us an illusion of control. The idea of anchoring has been a staple of behavioral finance since it was first applied to economics by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky 50 years ago. Their experiments showed that people's answers to numeric questions can be skewed just by showing them a number at random before they answer. In the unmoored climate of a polarized election that appears to be in a dead heat, our desire for an anchor will naturally grow. In the UK's Brexit referendum, betting markets put the chances that Britons would vote to leave the EU at one in five. Statisticians David Rothschild and Andrew Gelman argued afterwards that there was “a feedback mechanism whereby the betting-market odds reify themselves.” People distrusted polls, they said, but “we do watch the prediction markets, which all sorts of experts have assured us capture the wisdom of crowds.” Pollsters and pundits — and even the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage — were “to some extent anchoring themselves off the prediction odds,” and dismissed polls that showed Brexit in the lead. The clue, Rothschild and Gelman argued, was that a “mature prediction market should show measured, but real, swings in prices in response to news,” but the Brexit odds stayed weirdly stable. Polls closed with the market odds of Brexit at 31%. When they were proved wrong, the pound dropped by more than 10% in a matter of minutes — more than treble its previous worst fall. Brexit looks very much like a classic example of Soros' reflexivity at work — and on the face of it, suggests that the CFTC is amply justified in trying to keep political betting out of mainstream investment. Self-Fulfilling Prophecies The CFTC's problem is that the other markets it regulates exist to help manage risks, from fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates to the possibility of a catastrophic hurricane. Investors wish to insure against political surprises — with the fallout from the Brexit vote showing why they might be sensible. So how to allow that, while limiting the chance of either deliberate manipulation or innocent irrational exuberance which, with reflexivity, could turn markets into a tool for changing election results? There are two plausible solutions. The first, advocated by Kalshi and Polymarket, is to make markets liquid by attracting more money. With billions at stake, no individual can move the market. But for now, while they remain on a smaller scale, whales can make a big splash. The alternative is to limit liquidity. PredictIt's $850 limit on stakes thwarts whales. A rich person's views don't count for more just because they're rich. But it's harder to move the price when genuine news happens, and it reduces the market's usefulness as a place to manage risk. Limited markets might produce the public good of more robust predictions, but a multi-trillion dollar manager like BlackRock cannot hedge a given election result on PredictIt. Recent experiences with opening new markets have shown how difficult this can be. In the decade before the global financial crisis, quants spotted that emerging markets and commodity futures tended to gain over time, with a low correlation to stocks and bonds. That sounded like the holy grail for asset allocators, and big institutions piled in. Once they did so, however, they changed the way these markets behaved and interacted. If money moved into copper as a result of a deliberate decision to move out of bonds, for example, it was inevitable that bonds and copper would grow more correlated, which they did. In 2008, stocks, commodities and emerging markets all crashed together. Similarly, once big financial hedgers and/or wealthy individuals arrive in betting markets, there's no reason to assume those markets will keep behaving the same way. Treasury bonds, oil or tech stocks are deep markets combining people with many different motivations, and the messages they send should be taken very seriously; Kalshi, Polymarket and others are far from that scale. There's also the eternal issue of Garbage In, Garbage Out. Markets synthesize information and give participants an incentive to sniff out fake news. But they aren't a protection against bad information — if the polls are wrong, markets will be wrong. If well regulated, political prediction markets might yet provide probabilities that help guide us in times of uncertainty. But like all markets they will be prone to get things wrong, and while they remain largely unregulated, it behooves us to be careful. The threat of excommunication doesn't deter miscreants the way it once did. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

The US political election is driving bullish market sentiment, with Bitcoin posting inflows of over $920 million. The digital assets market recorded a boom for the week ending October 25, with net asset inflows reaching $901 million, according to CoinShares weekly report. Moreover, the growth has pushed crypto assets’ year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $27 billion, almost three times the value recorded throughout 2021. Further, the report revealed that Bitcoin amassed about $920 million in weekly inflows, with the upcoming US political elections driving the market boom. CoinShares reported: “We believe that current Bitcoin prices and flows are heavily influenced by US politics, with the recent surge in inflows likely linked to the Republicans’ poll gains.” Meanwhile, the US witnessed the biggest weekly inflows of about $906 million, a sharp contrast to other regions. Germany and Switzerland followed in the second and third positions with net inflows of $14.5 million and $9.2 million.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rises 0.8 percent as investors bet on strong earnings from Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. US tech stocks have catapulted the Nasdaq to a record high as investors bet on strong earnings from corporate heavyweights. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.8 percent on Tuesday, as Google’s parent company Alphabet reported forecast-beating earnings for the third quarter. Alphabet’s revenue jumped 15 percent to $88.3bn during the July-September period, while profit surged 34 percent to $26.3 bn. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company was experiencing “extraordinary” momentum due to the strong performance of its search and cloud businesses as well as its focus on innovation, including artificial intelligence. “Our commitment to innovation, as well as our long-term focus and investment in AI, are paying off and driving success for the company and for our customers,” Pichai said on an earnings call. “We are uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI because of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation, and we’re now seeing this operate at scale.” Alphabet’s share price rose nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading. The tech giant’s strong performance comes ahead of hotly-anticipated earnings results this week from Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon, all of which registered stock price gains on Tuesday. Shares of Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple rose 2.62 percent, 1.3 percent, 1.26 percent and 0.12 percent, respectively. Tesla, another of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks that account for more than one-third of the market, dropped 1.14 percent, after soaring 22 percent last week following a forecasting-beating profit in the third quarter. The broader market saw only a modest rise, with the benchmark S&P 500 inching up 0.2 percent. The strong performance of tech giants was offset by slumps by corporate giants including Ford and JetBlue Airways, which saw their stock price sink 8.4 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.

Nifty extended its recovery for a second consecutive session on October 29 rebounding well from morning lows. Banks (including PSU Banks) did well for the second consecutive session. Nifty formed a bullish candle on October 29 after forming a triple bottom in the 24073-24140 band and closed at its highest in 5 sessions. Its indicators are giving positive signals. The short term trend of Nifty seems to have turned bullish. Nifty could take support from the above band while on upmoves it can face resistance in the 24567-24694 band in the near term. Tuesday’s reversal higher in the nifty after an opening slump has the potential to further the near-term recovery. There are two reasons why this may occur. One, Monday’s rally created a Japanese “bullish harami” candlestick pattern, which got validated as yesterday’s recovery broke through the Friday high of 24,440. Two, historically, whenever the Nifty has fallen at least 0.5% below its previous close and recovered to settle a minimum of 1% above the same day’s low, the next few days have seen the market extend its advance. From the March ‘23 lows, this signal has been seen 11 other times, and in 8 of those instances, the nifty was higher by an average of 1.2% over the next 5 days. That said, any break below the Friday low of 24,074 will negate this potential rally. In yesterday’s session, Nifty and banking stocks made a solid comeback, with the advance-decline ratio favouring the bulls at 3:2. As we head towards the Diwali Muhurat session on Friday, November 1, 2024, market sentiment is expected to remain positive, buoyed by key drivers such as short covering ahead of the October F&O expiry, value buying, easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a sharp drop in oil prices below $67.50, and strong Q2 results from PSU banks like SBI, ICICI Bank, and Bandhan Bank. With this improving risk-on sentiment, a ‘buy on dips’ strategy is recommended for Nifty and Bank Nifty, while Siemens stands out as our top pick for a bullish move.

Jyothy Labs benefits from robust revenue growth, and NCC’s infrastructure projects show strong earnings potential. SBI’s tech innovations and consumer lending strength also make it a favored pick.

Nuvama Wealth Management’s overall AUM growth was robust with it totaling ₹4.4 lakh crore at end Q2F-Y25. The PAT number of ₹260 crore was up 77 per cent y-o-y and it beat our estimates.

The recent equity market rule changes or even a equity market slowdown should still lead to elevated levels in the division’s performance. The wealth businesses saw hiring of RMs (relationship managers) leading to elevated C/I ratios but we believe the ratio to taper down in the medium term. Management is confident to bring cost to income ratio to below 60 per cent in the next 2-3 years.

As Silver prices are trading at record high levels, it is advised to buy precious metal as an auspicious small token amount and not huge lumpsum this Dhanteras/Diwali in the form of physical silver coin, a few units of Silver ETF or some token amount in Digital Silver. One should wait for the Silver prices to correct and retrace to about $31 (~Rs 88500) in November/December and then accumulate precious metal at those levels. The best way to increase allocation into precious metal is to start the SIP or increase the amount of your Silver systematic purchases every month. Silver prices are expected to continue their uptrend in the next few months for the target of $38(~Rs 115,000) . So the strategy should be buying on dips at the mentioned levels for a 20% upside target in the next few months. -- Prithviraj Kothari, Managing Director of RiddiSiddhi Bullions Limited (RSBL) The stock idea that we have for you today is ICICI Securities.

Nifty extended its recovery for a second consecutive session on October 29 rebounding well from morning lows. Banks (including PSU Banks) did well for the second consecutive session. Nifty formed a bullish candle on October 29 after forming a triple bottom in the 24073-24140 band and closed at its highest in 5 sessions. Its indicators are giving positive signals. The short term trend of Nifty seems to have turned bullish. Nifty could take support from the above band while on upmoves it can face resistance in the 24567-24694 band in the near term. Tuesday’s reversal higher in the nifty after an opening slump has the potential to further the near-term recovery. There are two reasons why this may occur. One, Monday’s rally created a Japanese “bullish harami” candlestick pattern, which got validated as yesterday’s recovery broke through the Friday high of 24,440. Two, historically, whenever the Nifty has fallen at least 0.5% below its previous close and recovered to settle a minimum of 1% above the same day’s low, the next few days have seen the market extend its advance. From the March ‘23 lows, this signal has been seen 11 other times, and in 8 of those instances, the nifty was higher by an average of 1.2% over the next 5 days. That said, any break below the Friday low of 24,074 will negate this potential rally. In yesterday’s session, Nifty and banking stocks made a solid comeback, with the advance-decline ratio favouring the bulls at 3:2. As we head towards the Diwali Muhurat session on Friday, November 1, 2024, market sentiment is expected to remain positive, buoyed by key drivers such as short covering ahead of the October F&O expiry, value buying, easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a sharp drop in oil prices below $67.50, and strong Q2 results from PSU banks like SBI, ICICI Bank, and Bandhan Bank. With this improving risk-on sentiment, a ‘buy on dips’ strategy is recommended for Nifty and Bank Nifty, while Siemens stands out as our top pick for a bullish move.

Limited to select stock picks, Gravita India, National Aluminium Company, Jyothy Labs, NCC, and SBI emerge as top choices from brokerages like Axis Securities and Kotak Securities. Gravita India stands out with growth potential in battery recycling, while Nalco’s wind power and alumina expansions drive optimism. Jyothy Labs benefits from robust revenue growth, and NCC’s infrastructure projects show strong earnings potential. SBI’s tech innovations and consumer lending strength also make it a favored pick. Experts also highlight SIPs in small-cap and mid-cap mutual funds as prudent long-term investments. Nuvama Wealth Management’s overall AUM growth was robust with it totaling ₹4.4 lakh crore at end Q2F-Y25. The PAT number of ₹260 crore was up 77 per cent y-o-y and it beat our estimates. Capital markets stole the show with a 90 per cent and 98 per cent y-o-y growth in AUM and revenues, respectively. The recent equity market rule changes or even a equity market slowdown should still lead to elevated levels in the division’s performance. The wealth businesses saw hiring of RMs (relationship managers) leading to elevated C/I ratios but we believe the ratio to taper down in the medium term. Management is confident to bring cost to income ratio to below 60 per cent in the next 2-3 years. Tata Technologies’ Q2-FY25 earnings call aptly summarises the concerns highlighted in our ‘Know the cycle’ thematic report on automotive ER&D. Management believes the strategic consideration between electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids led by polarised policy positioning ahead of the US presidential elections, and regulatory concerns related to Chinese OEMs and associated tariff in the Europe is leading to decision-making delay, tapering of demand, and smaller deal sizes as customers are cautious to committing larger, long-term projects.

As Silver prices are trading at record high levels, it is advised to buy precious metal as an auspicious small token amount and not huge lumpsum this Dhanteras/Diwali in the form of physical silver coin, a few units of Silver ETF or some token amount in Digital Silver. One should wait for the Silver prices to correct and retrace to about $31 (~Rs 88500) in November/December and then accumulate precious metal at those levels. The best way to increase allocation into precious metal is to start the SIP or increase the amount of your Silver systematic purchases every month. Silver prices are expected to continue their uptrend in the next few months for the target of $38(~Rs 115,000) . So the strategy should be buying on dips at the mentioned levels for a 20% upside target in the next few months. -- Prithviraj Kothari, Managing Director of RiddiSiddhi Bullions Limited (RSBL) The stock idea that we have for you today is ICICI Securities.

Rising cloud revenue for AlphabetGoogle-parent Alphabet's third-quarter earnings beat expectations. The company's quarterly revenue was $88.27 billion, up 15% year on year, boosted by its cloud division's 35% jump in revenue from a year ago. Google's search and advertising revenue also grew. Net income was $26.3 billion, 33.5% higher than the year-ago quarter. Reddit swings to profitReddit shares surged almost 25% in extended trading Tuesday, breaking the $100 barrier for the first time, on the company's better-than-expected third-quarter results. Notably, Reddit turned profitable in the third quarter with net income of $29.9 million, compared with a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago. Mixed marketsOn Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.78% to close at a new high and the S&P 500 added 0.16%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.36%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 0.57%. Earnings results from European companies were mixed, causing trading in the region to be choppy. End of zero interest rates eraLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower rates only once, by 25 basis points, for the rest of this year because of high "embedded inflation," Fink said at a panel Tuesday. At the same event, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said the era of zero interest rates and zero inflation is over. [PRO] Citi likes these small-cap stocksThe Russell 2000 has gained around 10.4% so far this year. While that trails the S&P 500's 22% increase in the same period, both analysts and investors are paying more attention to small-cap stocks. As the Fed cuts interest rates, small-cap stocks tend to benefit more — and these are the small-cap stocks Citi thinks are good buys. A day in the life of an average office worker: Those behaviors are so ingrained in most of us that they're almost automatic and essential. It's not too surprising, then, that the companies behind those services – Snap, Reddit and Alphabet – reported third-quarter results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Their revenues, in particular, are bright spots. For its third quarter, Alphabet's advertising revenue increased 10.4% year on year. While Snap and Reddit didn't report their advertising top line specifically, there were indications both companies are also doing well in that area. Snap's total active advertisers have more than doubled from the year-ago quarter, according to CEO Evan Spiegel. That's coupled with two million more global daily active users than expected. More advertisers and more eyeballs mean more revenue per ad. Meanwhile, Reddit swung from a loss a year ago to earning a profit. That remarkable transformation was in part helped by a 47% year-over-year jump in daily active users and better-than-expected average revenue per user. All companies reported earnings after the bell. In extended trading, shares of Reddit rocketed almost 25%, Snap surged around 10.6% and Alphabet added 5.8%. It's Meta's and Microsoft's turn to report earnings later today. Microsoft isn't really involved in the ad market because it's more focused on enterprise products. But investors will be watching to see if Meta keeps up with the positive trend so far. Judging by how much time I spend on Meta-owned Instagram and see ads that seem to know exactly what I want, the company's ad revenue is likely to see healthy growth as well. — CNBC's Julia Boorstin, Jonathan Vanian and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.

October 29, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Oct. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WGO), Laser Photonics Corporation (NASDAQ: LASE), Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), and Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ: KSPI). Our investigations concern whether these companies have violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WGO) On September 23, 2024, Hunterbrook Media published an article called "‘Grand Deception"- Winnebago Muzzles Outcry Over Major Problem That Owners Say Makes RVs Dangerous, Untowable, Worthless." The article stated that Winnebago's "best-selling Grand Design RVs" appear to be "experiencing frame failure, potentially affecting thousands of units sold for more than a billion dollars. This defect has led to costly damage and potential safety hazards, and rendered some RVs unroadworthy." The article continued to state that "Winnebago has used NDAs, buybacks, and online censorship to silence complaints about frame failure[.]" Following this news, Winnebago's stock dropped $1.35 per share, or 2.28%, to close at $57.76 on September 23, 2024. For more information on the Winnebago investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/WGO Laser Photonics Corporation (NASDAQ:LASE) On September 23, 2024, Laser Photonics disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission "that the Company's previously issued financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, should no longer be relied upon as a result of the Company's predecessor auditor, Fruci & Associates II, PLLC (‘Fruci'), identifying an adjusting entry that Fruci had proposed and that was posted by the Company that overstated deferred revenue and needed to be corrected as discussed in further detail in Note 7 of the December 31, 2023, financial statements in the Company's Form 10-K/A that it filed on August 28, 2024, and the Form 10-Q/A filed September 12, 2024." On this news, Laser Photonics' stock price fell $6.90 per share, or 36.7%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $11.90 per share on September 25, 2024. For more information on the Laser Photonics investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/LASE Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) On September 24, 2024, during market hours, The United States Department of Justice issued a release entitled “Justice Department Sues Visa for Monopolizing Debit Markets.” In this release, the DOJ announced that it had “filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today against Visa for monopolization and other unlawful conduct in debit network markets[.]” The release further stated that the “complaint alleges that Visa illegally maintains a monopoly over debit network markets by using its dominance to thwart the growth of its existing competitors and prevent others from developing new and innovative alternatives.” The release quoted Attorney General Merrick Garland as stating that “[w]e allege that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market[.] Merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service. As a result, Visa’s unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing – but the price of nearly everything.” On this news, the price of Visa stock fell 5.4% on September 24, 2024. For more information on the Visa investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/V Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ: KSPI) On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims-especially ahead of the Company's January 2024 NASDAQ listing-that the Company has zero exposure to Russia", when in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." Following publication of the Culper Research report, Kaspi's American Depositary Receipt ("ADR") price fell $19.20 per ADR, or 16.13%, to close at $99.81 per ADR on September 19, 2024.

(Reuters) -Asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has emerged as the sole bidder in talks to acquire private credit firm HPS Investment Partners, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the discussions. The parties are seeking to reach an agreement by the end of this year, the report said, adding that HPS may pursue an initial public offering or a minority stake sale if the parties cannot reach an agreement on valuation. HPS would target a post-IPO valuation of $11 billion, with plans to seek a premium above that figure in a sale, the report said. BlackRock and HPS Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. BlackRock, which manages more than $10 trillion, is seeking to capitalize on a boom in investor demand for alternative assets, which includes anything from private equity to infrastructure. HPS Investment Partners is a global investment firm managing assets across debt, liquid credit including syndicated leveraged loans, asset-based finance and real estate, according to its website. It had about $117 billion of assets under management as of June 2024. Earlier in July, BlackRock agreed to buy UK data firm Preqin for 2.55 billion pounds ($3.32 billion) in cash. Later in September, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved BlackRock's $12.5 billion deal for Global Infrastructure Partners. ($1 = 0.7686 pounds)

Title: Alphabet’s stock jumps as ads, AI and cloud fuel strong revenue growth

UPDATED 20:14 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Google LLC’s parent company Alphabet Inc. trading higher in the after-hours session today following a solid earnings beat driven by strong cloud revenue growth. Alphabet’s stock was up more than 5% in extended trading, adding to a slight gain made during the regular trading session. The company reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.12 per share on revenue of $88.27 billion, up 15% from a year ago. The results were better than expected. Wall Street had been anticipating earnings of just $1.85 per share on lower sales of $86.3 billion. Alphabet’s all-important Google Cloud unit delivered revenue of $11.35 billion, representing growth of 35% on the $8.41 billion in sales it reported one year earlier. The company said this growth was primarily driven by rapid update of its artificial intelligence services, which includes subscriptions to enterprise customers. On a conference call with analysts, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai (pictured) insisted that Google Cloud’s “full stack” of AI products and services is already up and running at scale, used by billions of people worldwide and “creating a virtuous cycle.” With today’s report, Alphabet becomes the first of several “megacap” technology companies to report its latest earnings results, with Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. set to report Wednesday, and Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. to follow on Thursday. The company reported that its net income rose to $26.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $19.7 billion in the same period one year earlier. Google Search delivered $49.4 billion in sales during the quarter, up 12.3% from a year earlier, and it remains the biggest single contributor in terms of revenue growth, said Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi. She told investors that the company is planning to use AI to streamline workflows, manage its headcount and its physical footprint going forward, as it looks to build on its earlier cost-cutting efforts, which included thousands of layoffs last year and several hundred more earlier this year. “I plan to build on these efforts but also evaluate where we might be able to accelerate work and where we might need to pivot to free up capital for more attractive opportunities,” Ashkenazi, who joined Alphabet in June after spending 23 years at the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly Co. Alphabet’s advertising business also grew well in the quarter, with revenue of $65.85 billion, up from $59.65 billion in the year-ago quarter, though it grew at a slower pace on a sequential basis. Within that segment, YouTube’s advertising revenue came to $8.92 billion, just ahead of the analyst’s target of $8.89 billion, with more rapid growth than in the previous quarter. That growth was encouraging as the Google-owned company has faced strong pressure from other advertising competitors such as Amazon, Netflix Inc. and TikTok’s parent company Bytedance Ltd. Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said one reason for the growth is that AI is helping to improve YouTube recommendations. It has been using the Gemini large language model family to help recommend “more relevant, fresher and personalized content” to viewers, he insisted. Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said Alphabet’s results can be taken as a bellwether of what’s to come from the other big tech stocks set to report earnings later this week, as he’s expecting a “very strong season” thanks to a “surprisingly resilient economy and growingly supportive monetary outlook.” The analyst believes this is reflected in both Alphabet’s cloud and advertising businesses. “While some of these numbers certainly come from the positive seasonality, particularly with the U.S. election driving increasing interest in YouTube and search, the stock has been fairly underpriced amid a market that can’t seem to get enough tailwinds,” Monteiro said. Another encouraging sign was the performance of Google Workspace, which is Alphabet’s productivity tool suite. Ashkenazi said it also showed “strong growth,” as did Google Cloud Platform, which is the company’s data management and AI development suite, with revenue growing faster than that of the overall cloud unit. The Other Bets division, which includes Alphabet’s life sciences business Verily and the self-driving car division Waymo, delivered sales of $388 million during the quarter, up from $297 million in the same period one year ago. Waymo last week closed on a bumper $5.6 billion funding round, and aims to expand its nascent robotaxi service beyond Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco, where it currently operates. Pichai also talked up Google Lens, an image recognition product that uses smartphone cameras to conduct visual searches. According to Pichai, usage of the service has grown to more than 20 billion visual searches per month, making it one of the company’s fastest-growing products. He said it’s most often used by people out shopping, to find more information about the products they’re looking at. During the quarter, Alphabet’s executive team saw quite a shakeup. Along with Ashkenazi’s arrival, the company also replaced its longtime Search and Ads boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, who previously headed up the team leading the development of Google Assistant. In addition, Alphabet revealed that the team responsible for the Google Gemini app is joining Google DeepMind, where it will report to Demis Hassabis. Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, hailed Alphabet’s strong beat across the board. “It reported stronger-than-expected revenue in all categories, including search, YouTube ads and Google Cloud, leading to 15%+ revenue growth,” he said. In light of the results, Wlodarczak said Pivotal is raising its expectations for Alphabet in the fourth quarter and beyond, reiterating its “buy” rating on the stock, which still has “substantial upside from current levels.” THANK YOU Alphabet's stock jumps as ads, AI and cloud fuel strong revenue growth Elon Musk's xAI reportedly in talks to raise new funding on $40B valuation Cisco debuts new Nvidia-powered data center systems for AI workloads GPU cloud operator GMI Cloud secures $82M investment Cyber split: Check Point shares down, Commvault up on quarterly earnings Celona announces beefed-up 5G LAN Security Suite and expanded partner program Alphabet's stock jumps as ads, AI and cloud fuel strong revenue growth CLOUD - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 22 MINS AGO Elon Musk's xAI reportedly in talks to raise new funding on $40B valuation AI - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 52 MINS AGO Cisco debuts new Nvidia-powered data center systems for AI workloads AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 1 HOUR AGO GPU cloud operator GMI Cloud secures $82M investment AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 3 HOURS AGO Cyber split: Check Point shares down, Commvault up on quarterly earnings SECURITY - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 5 HOURS AGO Celona announces beefed-up 5G LAN Security Suite and expanded partner program INFRA - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 7 HOURS AGO

He said it’s most often used by people out shopping, to find more information about the products they’re looking at. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said investors have lots to be happy about, with Google Cloud showing strong growth thanks to its AI offerings. He said he’s optimistic about the company’s future AI growth too, thanks to its ongoing efforts to provide the best infrastructure for AI models. “Google has just announced the sixth generation of its TPU architecture, which leads the market in terms of performance,” Mueller said. “It has a three-to-four year lead over its rivals in putting custom algorithms on custom silicon, and that is illustrated by its fast-growing Google Cloud revenue. That’s why it’s no surprise to see Google is drinking its own champagne, using AI to try and increase the operational efficiency of its business.” During the quarter, Alphabet’s executive team saw quite a shakeup.

Google is still thriving while the company navigates through a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence and battles regulators trying to topple its internet empire SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is still thriving while the company navigates through a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence and battles regulators trying to topple its internet empire. The latest evidence of Google’s prosperity emerged Tuesday with the release of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc.’s results for the July-September period. Both Alphabet’s profit and revenue increased at a brisker pace than industry analysts anticipated, thanks primarily to a moneymaking machine powered by Google’s ubiquitous search engine. Alphabet earned $26.3 billion, or $2.12 per share during the most recent quarter, a 34% increase from a year ago. Revenue rose 15% from the same time last year to $88.27 billion. “Our commitment to innovation as well as the long-term focus and investment in AI are paying off,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said during a call discussing the results. The profits would have been even higher if Google wasn’t pouring so much money into building up its AI arsenal in a technological arms race that includes other industry heavyweights Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and rising star OpenAI. The AI investments are the primary reason Google’s capital expenditures in the past quarter soared 62% from the same time last year to $13.1 billion. The AI spending will likely stay at roughly the same level during the current October-December period, and the rise even higher next year, according to Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet's chief financial officer. But Ashkenazi also emphasized the Mountain View, California, company will act on cost-cutting opportunities in other areas to help boost profits. Alphabet already has trimmed its payroll from more than 190,000 worldwide employees early last year to about 181,000 workers now. In an example of how AI can perform tasks that once required human brainpower, Pichai said the technology is now writing more than 25% of the company's new computer coding. Investors seemed pleased with the both the performance and what they heard from company executives. Alphabet's stock price climbed 5% in extended trading after the numbers came out and the conference call was completed. Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said Alphabet's showing makes it likely more good news will be coming for Big Tech as this week progresses, with quarterly reports from Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Apple still to come in the days ahead. But a 4-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice has cast a cloud of uncertainty over Google’s future. After weighing the evidence presented during a high-profile trial last year, a federal judge declared Google’s search engine is an illegal monopoly — a decision that has opened the door for a major shake-up. Earlier this month, the Justice Department suggested it might seek to break up Google as part of penalties that will be determined by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta next summer. Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store for Android smartphone apps. That ruling came earlier this month after a jury decided that operation also was an illegal monopoly. Google is also nearing the end of another antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network. As if the regulatory headaches aren’t enough, Google is also in the midst of a major makeover of its search engine that is putting an increasing emphasis on highlight results produced by artificial intelligence in response to competitive threats to alternative options relying on the same potentially revolutionary technology. For now, at least, Google remains a juggernaut. The digital ads tied to Google’s search engine remained the financial cornerstone. Revenue from that segment climbed 12% from a year ago to $49.39 billion. And Google’s cloud division is growing at an even more robust rate, thanks to demand for AI services. The cloud division generated $11.35 billion in revenue during the past quarter, a 35% increase from last year. But the regulatory questions dogging Google remain a worry among investors. Although Alphabet’s shares have surged by more than 20% so far this year, Tuesday’s closing price of $169.68 remains well below their high of nearly $192 reached in July before the search engine monopoly ruling came out. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Is Bezos Ushering in New Era at Washington Post?

Send an email to Katrina. Is Jeff Bezos going to bring back real journalism? In a shocking move, The Washington Post announced Friday it would not be endorsing a presidential candidate, after decades of doing so and after the outlet’s editorial board had written an endorsement of Kamala Harris. Two Post journalists reported that the decision had been made by Post owner Bezos, the billionaire behind shopping behemoth Amazon and rocket company Blue Origin. For many subscribers, Bezos’ action was a betrayal. More than 200,000 people—or about 8% of The Washington Post’s subscriber base—canceled their subscriptions, NPR reported. Several Post journalists resigned. Accusations swirled that Bezos’ decision was influenced by business considerations. (He says it was not.) “The Washington Post has gone from ‘All The President’s Men’ to ‘All The Dictator’s Lapdogs,’” sneered one reader, according to Post columnist Dana Milbank. Another reader wrote, “Without resigning, you are basically endorsing Hitler.” But for the American people, this might signal the beginning of a new era of journalism. USA Today will also not endorse a presidential candidate this year, and owner Patrick Soon-Shiong decided the Los Angeles Times would not be endorsing this year either. Indeed, kudos to @JeffBezos https://t.co/UNh4rlB3lS In a column published Monday night on The Washington Post, Bezos decided to speak for himself—and in the course of doing so, he also spoke up for the millions of Americans who have watched in horror as major American news outlets have morphed into propaganda rags valuing ideology over truth. “In the annual public surveys about trust and reputation, journalists and the media have regularly fallen near the very bottom, often just above Congress,” wrote Bezos. “But in this year’s Gallup poll, we have managed to fall below Congress.” “Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working.” According to the Gallup poll cited by Bezos, more than two-thirds of Americans have no or little trust or confidence in the media. Given the sorry state of news reporting these days, that’s not surprising—and The Washington Post itself has played a major role in why Americans are rightly skeptical of media. Consider the Post’s ridiculously hyperbolic slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” That slogan, the first in the Post’s history, was launched in 2017, a mere month after Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. So much for a veneer of fairness toward the new administration. And what about the Post’s coverage of the alleged Trump-Russia collusion? The Washington Post in 2021 had to correct and remove significant portions of two articles, published in 2017 and 2019, about the infamous Steele Dossier. But that wasn’t the only thing the outlet should be embarrassed about when it comes to its coverage of Trump’s so-called collusion with Russia. The Columbia Journalism Review, no conservative outlet, published last year a damning review of how top outlets, including The Washington Post, covered the matter. For instance, Post opinion columnist Josh Rogin wrote an article during the 2016 GOP convention headlined “Trump campaign guts GOP’s anti-Russian stance on Ukraine,” referring to the Republican platform. Rogin’s report “caught the attention of other journalists,” writes Jeff Gerth for the Columbia Journalism Review. “Within a few days, Paul Krugman, in his [New York] Times column, called Trump the ‘Siberian candidate,’ citing the ‘watering down’ of the platform. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, labeled Trump a ‘de facto agent’ of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. He cited the Rogin report …” Gerth, who spent decades at The New York Times as an investigative reporter, adds, “The story would turn out to be an overreach.” “Subsequent investigations found that the original draft of the platform was actually strengthened by adding language on tightening sanctions on Russia for Ukraine-related actions, if warranted, and calling for ‘additional assistance’ for Ukraine. What was rejected was a proposal to supply arms to Ukraine, something the Obama administration hadn’t done,” he explained. Whoops? Bob Woodward, the longtime investigative reporter who broke the Watergate story, referred to the Steele Dossier as a “garbage document” in a 2017 interview with “Fox News Sunday.” According to Gerth, Woodward attempted to make the case against the dossier to his Post colleagues. Those colleagues apparently weren’t interested in what the respected investigative journalist had to say. “To be honest, there was a lack of curiosity on the part of the people at the Post about what I had said, why I said this, and I accepted that, and I didn’t force it on anyone,” Woodward told Gerth about his colleagues’ response. Of course, we know now from special counsel John Durham’s 2023 report that the Steele Dossier was indeed a “garbage document.” In an analysis of the Durham report, Heritage Foundation legal scholars John Malcolm, Cully Stimson, and Zack Smith wrote that “the Russian intelligence officers could have fed disinformation to the very people who were ultimately cited in the series of six reports prepared by Christopher Steele—the so-called Steele dossier—on behalf of the [Hillary] Clinton campaign and furnished to the FBI.” Nor was it only Russia collusion where the Post seemed driven by politics, not facts. In Trump’s first 100 days in office, the Post calculated he made 492 false or misleading claims. But the Post claimed that President Joe Biden only made 78 false or misleading claims in his first 100 days in office. While Trump may talk more and in a looser style than Biden, it simply strains credulity that he was guilty of five times as many falsehoods as Biden in the same period of time. Another clear example of bias was how The Washington Post approached the issue of Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop and his emails, first reported in October 2020 by the New York Post. Writing on the New York Post report in that same month, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler talked about former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s conversations with a Ukrainian lawmaker and commented that those “interactions have given rise to fears that the [Hunter Biden] emails could be part of a broader disinformation campaign.” (Talking to Ukrainian lawmakers wouldn’t be cool until Democrats did it, apparently.) It wasn’t until March of 2022 that The Washington Post admitted the laptop–and the emails—were legitimate. While Bezos may be pivoting, all of these examples took place under his ownership of the paper, which he acquired in 2013. Furthermore, Bezos’ own words suggest that he thinks The Washington Post is more guilty of the appearance of bias, rather than actual bias. “Let me give an analogy. Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must believe they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first,” he writes. “Likewise with newspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement.” But of course, journalists in major media outlets are also failing on the first requirement. That’s not good. Endorsements from the editorial board aren't what killed the reputation of the @washingtonpost, it's the blatant leftwing bias of the reporters and editors on the news side that caused them to lose the trust of so many Americans. CC @JeffBezos https://t.co/lXS2aQfMfZ Sure, I’m grateful to be part of The Daily Signal, which—along with outlets such as The Federalist, Just The News, The Daily Wire, The Washington Free Beacon, The Daily Caller, and more—has risen up in a time when Americans desperately need more options for credible news reporting. But the fact is that The Washington Post employs around 940 journalists. The New York Times employs 1,700 journalists. Prior to layoffs earlier this year, NBC News and MSNBC had 3,500 employees, as did CNN. The Daily Signal currently has 13 full-time employees. You see the problem? Sure, my fervent hope is that The Daily Signal will continue growing and adding new reporters. (Donate here to support our serious news reporting.) But even if we quadrupled our number of journalists, we would still be less than 5% the size of The Washington Post. Good, exhaustive reporting that prioritizes truth is expensive and time-consuming. To thoroughly cover the enormous U.S. government, it’s critical to have a huge staff. Bezos has an enormous opportunity here to use his and the Post’s resources to bring back serious, credible news reporting, reporting that is driven by the truth and the need for the government to be accountable to the American people. He was brave enough to stick his neck out and deny an endorsement to Harris. And he was brave enough, amid the uproar, to defend his position. “I will … not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance—overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs—not without a fight. It’s too important. The stakes are too high,” wrote Bezos. “Now more than ever, the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice, and where better for that voice to originate than the capital city of the most important country in the world? To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles.” He’s certainly right about exercising new muscles. The Post could start by trying to cover lawmakers from both parties similarly and by adding conservative voices to its opinion pages more regularly. But if Bezos is serious, this could be an amazing opportunity for the Post and for Americans hoping for a serious news organization that informs, not indoctrinates. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences. By supporting The Daily Signal Institute today, you will help cut through the liberal media spin and provide honest, thorough, and responsible reporting to millions of Americans and decisionmakers in Washington.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Tuesday. The technology and communication sectors outperformed ahead of a wave of marquee earnings reports, but other sectors including energy and utilities lost ground. The S&P 500 closed the session 0.2% higher. Tech sector strength helped the Nasdaq gain 0.8%, lifting the index to an all-time closing high. The Dow did not fare as well, slipping 0.4%. Shares of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) surged 12.5% on Tuesday to notch the top daily performance of any S&P 500 stock after the electronic design automation firm posted better-than-expected quarterly results and boosted its full-year guidance. Revenue from the company's Cadence.AI portfolio, which builds generative AI and big data analysis into design processes, more than tripled year-over-year. Although Incyte (INCY) reported third-quarter profits that fell short of analysts' forecasts, the pharma company's revenue for the period exceeded expectations, and its shares jumped 12.0%. Incyte said both of its key products—cancer drug Jakafi and topical eczema treatment Opzelura—enjoyed strong demand and sales trends during the period. Application delivery company F5 (FFIV) delivered a quarterly sales and profit beat for its fiscal fourth quarter, and its shares jumped 10.1%. F5's CEO touted the company's transformation from its focus on hardware into a provider of security and software solutions better geared toward the current hybrid and cloud-based technological environment. Leidos Holdings (LDOS) shares added 9.5% after the IT services provider beat consensus estimates with its third-quarter sales and profit results. Strong bookings figures for the quarter also suggest that Leidos is poised for additional growth, and the company lifted its full-year outlook. Major U.S. defense contract wins contributed to the solid performance and upbeat forecast. Shares of tool manufacturer Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) tumbled 8.8%, the biggest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of an underwhelming quarterly update. The company said weak demand from consumers and the auto industry pressured its performance, contributing to a quarterly sales and profit miss. Tuesday's decline sank Stanley Black & Decker into negative for 2024. Ford Motor (F) shares skidded on Tuesday, dropping 8.4% after the carmaker reported lower-than-expected third-quarter profits. Following the earnings miss, JPMorgan and Bank of America trimmed their price targets on Ford stock. However, analysts pointed to some reasons for optimism, noting that high warranty expenses contributed to the profit shortfall and highlighting the potential of the Ford Pro division. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) reported year-over-year declines in revenue and net income, falling short of estimates on the top and bottom lines. The company also issued lower-than-expected full-year sales guidance, indicating that it sees pressure from potential homebuyers holding out for lower mortgage rates. D.R. Horton shares fell 7.2%.

Title: Hobby CAD, CNC machining, and resin casting

A tutorial for getting top-notch results with benchtop CNC mills and modern polymers Copyright (C) 2013, 2014, 2015 by Michal Zalewski (lcamtuf@coredump.cx) I'm a computer geek by day, and an occasional hobbyist robot builder by night. For most DIYers, the craft of robotics requires either deep pockets, or a combination of outstanding manual skills and easy access to a top-notch machine shop. Because of this, many urban-dwelling enthusiasts tend to give up, resort to expensive and limiting premade kits, or fall back to junkyard-quality engineering. The simplest tasks are often the biggest challenge. Many can program a microcontroller; not as many know how to make a simple actuated joint, a custom gearwheel, or a custom chassis for their creations. With 3D printers, we've been promised a revolution in desktop manufacturing, but many of the issues are more fundamental - having to do with mastering CAD software or understanding materials science to make lightweight and durable parts. Meanwhile, on the manufacturing side, a simple, affordable, and home-workshop-friendly solution - CNC machining coupled with resin casting - is already within reach. Around 2007, I took a huge leap of faith, decided to buy a small CNC mill (Roland MDX-15), set up a resin casting workshop, and then engaged in a fair amount of trial and error to understand the tech. Today, I can routinely crank out remarkably cool and precise designs in no time, and with only minimal cost: This guide is more or less modular. If you're interested in buying a CNC mill, keep reading. If you already have one and know how it works, or want to try the overall process with a 3D printer or other manufacturing process, you can skip directly to the relevant part: Section 3: A crash course in CAD and CAM. Section 4: A primer on high-performance casting resins and moldmaking work. Section 5: A library of components for electromechanical projects. Section 6.1: Simple part design techniques for optimal rigidity and strength. Section 6.2: An introduction to gear geometries and transmission systems. In basic terms, computer numerical control milling is a "subtractive" method for processing raw material (workpiece or stock), usually with a drill-like rotating cutter (end mill), through a set of computer-driven movements of the cutting head. You can think of it as a robot equipped with a Dremel tool. Some of the most basic CNC mills resemble a drill press on steroids. A growing number of them is designed specifically for home and office uses, and have more sophisticated looks - but still, in comparison with technologies such as 3D printing, which produces 3D shapes by additive deposition, CNC machining seems pretty savage. In reality, the most common hobby 3D printing method - FDM, or fused deposition modeling - is difficult to use for precision, high-quality parts. The extrusion process is finicky and dimensionally inaccurate; further, materials such as PLA tend to exhibit poor mechanical strength. Affordable resin printers are more promising, but also surprisingly messy and excruciatingly slow. For now, CNC has an upper hand on four fronts: Precision: when I started working on the guide, this was a good result from a Makerbot FDM printer; and this would be a more common example. The technology has improved since, but it's still nowhere near WYSIWYG. In contrast, CNC mills can achieve true mechanical resolutions of 5 µm (0.005 mm) in all axes, and produce silk smooth surfaces for almost arbitrarily complex parts. Right now, the real-world accuracy of a $2,000 mill is usually difficult to replicate with any printer that costs less than $20,000. In fact, even with very expensive printers, there tend to be significant constraints on what you can make: features smaller than 0.7 mm in the X-Y plane, or under 0.1-0.2 mm in the Z axis, are often taboo. Choice of materials: CNC machines work in cheap, commodity materials - anything from wax, to transparent plastics, to PCBs, to wood, to plaster, to aluminum, to steel. 3D printers, on the other hand, are restricted to a small set of proprietary stock, and produce parts that are rarely suitable for demanding applications - chiefly due to poor strength. Cost per part: With the processes advocated in this guide, the cost of making a small part out of high strength, engineering grade plastic, or from tough rubber, seldom exceeds 25 cents; the raw material hovers at about $15 per liter or so (this photo log has a detailed price breakdown). Speed: A typical cutting process takes between 5 minutes and 3 hours on a medium size CNC mill. When it's done, it's done: you don't need to remove intricate supports, wash, sandblast, polish, seal, or post-cure the part. Most additive technologies take much, much longer to produce usable parts of similar size, and almost always require painstaking manual work to get rid of manufacturing artifacts. On the flip side, the fundamental advantage that 3D printers have over CNC mills is that they can often produce basic internal geometries inside enclosed parts - whereas milling can only process the areas for which there is a sufficient cutter clearance. It is not always trivial to do that on low-cost 3D printers - and the constraint of CNC mills is seldom a big deal: almost everything can be split into halves, rotated, or so. Still, it is a constraint, even if almost every mass-produced item - from iPads to soda bottles - copes with this reality in a graceful way. Resin casting is a nifty process that involves creating a mold, and then pouring a liquid, two-component polymer resin into the mold cavity. Once the resin sets, the finished part is removed - and the mold can be used again. This method of replicating parts is popular artists of all trades, but is seldom employed in amateur CNC or 3D printing work. Despite sounding needlessly complicated, it's a fantastic addition to any DIY workshop. It offers some interesting advantages over directly machining (or printing, or hand-carving) the desired shape: You can use just about any material, including some truly exotic choices. You can master the workflow for one easily-shaped tooling material - perhaps even clay! - and then make the final part out of rubber, glass-filled composite, low-melt metal, or concrete laced with rocks. You can customize the apperance of the part, practically for free. There is no need to spend money on a variety of differently colored materials, you can just add several drops of dye. You can replicate and tweak parts easily. You can quickly make 50 identical gearwheels, instantly replicate a broken part, or change the mechanical properties of a component on the go. You save materials and time. Directly machining a part out of aluminum or plastic involves starting with a rectangular stock and then removing most of it. Moldmaking is considerably more efficient, with less waste and faster cycle times. Although you can follow this guide just for the CNC bits, some of the content is geared toward that process - and it's probably worth your time. As with any hobby, sky is the limit! That said, if you want to get good results on a budget, the breakdown of expenses is roughly this: CNC mill: as little as $1,000 to $3,000 for an entry-level unit; around $150 for end mills and collets. CAD / CAM software: $0 to $1,000, depending on taste. Free of charge options are available, and work reasonably well. Resin casting setup: $100 for a vacuum pump; $70 for chamber and hoses; less than $100 for mold releases, cups, and other auxiliary supplies. Media for moldmaking work: $230 for a giant (150 x 50 cm) prototyping board; $120 for two gallons of polyurethane resin; $130 for a pail of silicone. This should last for at least a year. Other tools: $70 for a micron-resolution micrometer; $50 for a micron-resolution dial indicator; $40 for a simple magnifier. For the processes advocated in this guide, the ongoing maintenance costs for a CNC mill are negligible: after several thousand hours of machining, you may have to replace several bearings or spindle motor; cutters should last for hundreds of hours, too. The savings add up quickly, especially if you are already paying for specialty or made-to-order parts. Okay, still interested? Let's dive in, then. The first "proper" section of this guide deals with shopping for a mill and understanding its operating characteristics; picking the appropriate cutting tools; and monitoring the performance of your setup to achieve perfect results every time. Again, if you're using another manufacturing process and are interested strictly in the CAD tutorial or the resin casting bits, feel free to skip ahead. Some purists make a distinction between what they call "CNC routers", suited chiefly for working in wood and plastics, and "true" CNC mills, designed for machining steel. This guide will not dwell on this; almost any CNC machine can handle almost any material, albeit not always as quickly as a beefier mill. Just as importantly, the focus on metal is usually a distraction. Unless you're making car parts or firearms, machining metals isn't cost-effective and in home workshops, isn't particularly fun. With this in mind: gneral purpose, benchtop-sized CNC mills start at around $600 and go up to $20,000 or so. There are numerous manufacturers of benchtop CNC mills around the world; examples include Carbide 3D, Laguna Tools, Roland DG, Taig, LittleMachineShop, Probotix, and many more. Some folks have luck with ultra-low cost mills made in China, too, although this is hit-and-miss. When shopping for a pre-made system, there are several key characteristics to pay attention to; let's have a look at them, and use them as an excuse to discuss some of the inner workings of CNC milling jobs. This is perhaps the most fundamental quality of any CNC mill. In the most basic design, the cutting head can move in three directions - X, Y, and Z - and the tool itself always points down, aligned with the Z axis. In this setup, the machine can only machine shapes that can be represented using a two-dimensional "depth map" projected onto the workpiece: the cutter may descend lower for some X-Y coordinates, and move up for others, but it will not enter the workpiece from any other side. This video is a pretty good illustration of the process: In this machining mode, the machinable geometries are outlined here: Note: CAM applications are designed to fail safely in regard to part geometry; that is, if a cavity on the part can't be reached without going through an area that isn't supposed to be cut, the problematic region won't be machined at all. The gray regions in the two workpieces on the right correspond to the material that will be left in place. The limitations of three-axis machining may seem severe, but seldom truly are. Every section of an industrial injection mold or a metal forming die typically needs to be a depth projection anyway, so that the processed material could be pulled out of it easily. Even in direct machining, it is common to simply flip the workpiece with the aid of registration pins. This video illustrates the manual rotation process fairly well. That said, there are some shapes that truly benefit from automated, multi-directional machining; this includes exotic types of gears (helical, herringbone, and worm geometries), screws / bolts, and certain categories of jewelry (say, rings). For these uses, some CNC mills come with additional rotary "axes": the so-called A axis corresponds to rotating the workpiece around the X axis (see video); B axis stands for rotation around Y; and C axis is the rotation around Z. The four-axis AXYZ setup is the most common one. The premium for fourth axis starts at around $100 for manual indexers (a precision rotary chuck that holds the workpiece, but where the angle needs to be dialed in manually); and from $500-$1,000 for computer controlled units. What to buy: 99% of moldmaking work will not appreciably benefit from a fourth axis, so three axes are usually fine. You may want to get a mill where fourth axis is an option, though, especially if you are also planning to projects such as jewelry or artistic figurines. Greater X-Y-Z tool movement ranges translate to the ability to make larger parts in a single pass. It's important to pick a mill that won't get in the way of your imagination - but to make this call, you need to calibrate your expectations sensibly. As an extreme example, let's consider building a man-sized biped robot. You don't need a man-sized mill for that job - for at least three reasons: Although the entire project would be obviously pretty big, virtually all the individual parts should be much smaller. In fact, most of the components will likely fall into the range of 1 to 30 cm. Any oversized part can be broken into sequentially machined segments. If you are using the resin casting process, this scales up almost arbitrarily; in other types of work, you will see some (usually modest) constraints. Many large and simple elements do not have to be machined at all; for example, it would be sensible to make the frame out of pipes or metal rods sawed to the desired length, and then simply machine custom connectors and joints that hold the frame together. What to buy: do your own math. In my experience, about 15 x 10 cm in the X-Y plane is a good starting point, and about 30 x 20 cm will accommodate almost any medium-size robotic job. In the Z axis, you will probably not need more than 4 cm or so; and going over 8 cm is usually pointless. Whatever you do, do not confuse movement ranges with table dimensions, though. Spindle - the part that connects the motor and the rotating tool - has a profound impact on the accuracy of any CNC mill. Its role is to ensure that the rotation of the tool is highly concentric and vibration-free, and that it stays this way under load. If the whole rig is not perfectly centered, you may end up with a situation such as this: The total amount of back-and-forth wobble - in other words, the difference between the intended and effective diameter of the tool - is known as total indicated runout, or TIR. High TIR will not only affect the dimensional accuracy of machined parts, but will also ruin surface finish, and prematurely wear the tool. In fact, the effect is pretty dramatic: in some materials, eccentricity of 0.01 mm can reduce tool life by 50%. Proper CNC spindles are usually long, round or rectangular blocks of metal with precision ball bearings mounted on both ends (and often pre-tensioned with a spring). Inside, there is a heavy-duty rotating shaft that couples the motor belt drive system to the tool holder. With quality spindles, TIR usually can be kept below 2 µm. Some of the low-end manufacturers don't bother with a proper spindle, however; the most common example of this are CNC mills that use repurposed manual rotary tools. These cases are a bit of a gamble: some of them may have still somewhat bearable TIR in the vicinity of 0.01 mm - but some will be as bad as 0.10 mm, which makes them fairly bad for precision work. Runout aside, you also can't be sure if the tool is perfectly aligned with the Z axis or not; if it isn't, that opens a yet another can of worms. Note: to put all these numbers in perspective, 0.10 mm is roughly the diameter of a human hair; level differences of this magnitude can be easily felt when sliding your finger across a hard surface. Notches down to about 0.05 mm can be easily seen on smooth but matte finishes - and on glossy surfaces, the threshold may be closer to 0.01 mm or so. What to buy: try to avoid CNC mills without real spindles; if you need to get one, ask the manufacturer about TIR. If they are not sure, it's an obvious red flag: the parameter can be trivially measured with a $50 tool, and is one of the most rudimentary things to examine when designing a mill. Note that there are aftermarket spindles that can be fitted into certain mills, though! There are many factors that contribute to the real-world precision of a CNC mill, but one of the most important aspects is repeat accuracy: the ability to return to the same position over and over again. Along with spindle characteristics, this quality has a tremendous impact on surface finish, and on the dimensional accuracy of small parts. Repeat accuracy is affected chiefly by two things: Backlash: many types of transmissions will have some amount of play, which often leads to imperfections in positioning. This play tends to be greater in CNC mills that use stepper motors or acme screw drives; and lower with servo motors and ball screws. Mill rigidity: machines that use low-cost materials (HDPE, plywood, sheet metal) to hold everything together, rely on rudimentary slides to support the moving parts, or use timing belts as a motion system, will deflect more significantly under load, or in response to own acceleration and deceleration. This problem is much less pronounced in mills with heavy-duty cast frames and ball-bearing linear ways. Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted standard for testing repeat accuracy; many manufacturers don't bother to advertise it, and others test it with varying levels of honesty. In fact, the good guys will give you a figure that represents the worst-case, momentary deviation following a rapid long-distance movement - but that's not really representative of most types of fine work with sub-millimeter tools. Now, don't despair: the good news is that most of the commercially available mills are actually pretty good in this department, especially when moving slower and doing precision cuts in easily machinable stock. You can expect many entry-level mills to conduct themselves within 0.02 mm or better during normal work; more expensive units with ball screws and servo motors will probably stay around 2-5 µm. Accuracy aside, mechanical resolution is the other important piece of the puzzle. Stepper or servo motors in a CNC mill can assume only a certain number of positions per turn, and that translates to a specific minimum distance by which the table or the cutting head can be moved around. Insufficient mechanical resolution means that the mill will have difficulty smoothly approximating certain curves, and may end up producing unattractive finish. What to buy: The basic rule is that you should not expect a plywood-based contraption with acme screws to reach 1 µm repeat accuracy. If the manufacturer advertises an improbable value, ask them to explain. If they advertise a suspiciously high figure (over 0.1 mm or so), be wary, too. As for the mechanical resolution: look for 5 µm or better. Time is money. When it comes to CNC machining, the time needed to complete a job is to a surprising extent dependent on your skill and the capabilities of your software - but with a skilled operator and good toolpath decisions, the final part of the equation is always the performance of the mill itself. To understand how the mill's performance is tied to the numbers you see in the datasheet, it is helpful to look at the geometry of a typical end mill. Upon closer inspection, the tool closely resembles a drill: it consists of a round shaft with several blades (flutes) wrapped around it in a spiral fashion. As opposed to a drill, however, these flutes have a sharp, exposed edge running along their entire length; this is because the bulk of their work is meant to be done by moving sideways. This is how it looks from the top: Even in the most easily machinable material imaginable, the cutter is able to scoop away only a certain amount of swarf per turn - just enough to fit under the flute. If you exceed that capacity, you will end up dragging a clogged, non-cutting tool across the workpiece - which ends with one or the other eventually giving up. For every material and cutter geometry, there is an optimal ratio of linear speed and cutter RPM that leads to efficient, high-quality machining. This is often expressed as feed per tooth. In plastics and similar materials, the ideal values are: Up to 0.1-0.2 mm for larger tools used to do the bulk of material removal in every cutting job. These tools frequently have four flutes, so this translates to 0.4-0.8 mm per turn. Down to 0.01 mm or less for sub-miniature, 2-flute cutters used to reproduce minutiae detail (0.02 mm per turn). In practical terms, it's healthy to aim for mills where the ratio between maximum movement speed (mm/min) and maximum RPM hovers around 0.4 to 0.8 for optimum performance during rough cutting. At the same time, there is also some value in shopping for the highest maximum RPM you can get - as it lets you move faster during the precision finishing steps. Of course, there are some gotchas: Very high spindle speeds tend to be problematic; going over 25,000 RPM or so may cause problems with heat dissipation, tool oscillation, and so on. High traverse speed can help even without high RPM. This is because certain types of cutting jobs involve a fair amount of rapid, non-cutting movements between various locations to be machined. Good CAM applications should know to avoid excess travel, but not all CAM applications are very good. Acceleration matters. Fast-moving mills need to be good at accelerating and braking to fully utilize their capabilities during series of short, stop-and-go movements that are often involved in CNC work. Rates of at least 0.1 G (~1 m/s²) are desirable in any mill capable of four-digit speeds. What to buy: at least 6,000 RPM is nice; and if the aforementioned speed ratio is favorable, there are no real downsides to going up to 20,000 RPM. Maximum movement speed, in mm/min, should be ideally at least 6-10 times the movement range, so that it doesn't take more than several seconds to traverse the table. Spare for some pathological situations, the mill is intrinsically aware of the position of its spindle at any given time; but the actual cutting action takes place beneath the spindle - at a distance dictated by how far the tool sticks out from its holder. And here lies the problem: most toolholding systems do not allow you to precisely preset tool extension length, or to maintain it when you replace the cutter. If you switch the tool in the middle of a machining process, and don't compensate for the difference, the results will be off; in fact, the tool may unexpectedly hit an uncut area and break. There are several manual tricks that can be used to work around this issue. One of them is to place a thin strip of paper or foil in a fixed reference location, and then slowly lower the tool until the strip gets caught between the cutter and whatever happens to be underneath. By comparing the Z position of the spindle at that point with the reading obtained for the previous tool, the appropriate offset can be calculated and communicated to the machine. But of course, this technique is somewhat inconvenient, and accurate only to perhaps 0.05 mm. A better approach is to incorporate a tool height sensor into the mill. The sensor can be just a flat block of precisely machined metal; the mill automatically lowers the tool onto the sensor until contact is made - which, in the simplest design, is detected by noticing the flow of current between the probe and spindle body. The accuracy of this approach is often better than 0.01 mm. More complex (and costly) solutions involving optical sensors can also be used. What to buy: try to find a mill that has a built-in sensor, or can be equipped with one. Failing this, you can always rig a manual tester that uses the same operating principle, and simply illuminates a LED. The spindle must be terminated with some sort of a tool holding device. This can be a direct system, where the tool slides into the spindle assembly with no intermediate components; a collet-based approach, where the spindle accepts a small clamping device that actually grips the cutter and is tightened with a nut; or a model where the spindle has a large tapered bore that accepts standalone toolholders used by automatic tool changers. Leaving automatic tool changers and exotic cutters aside, the simplest way to clamp an endmill is to use a fixed-diameter opening, be it using a set screw or thermal expansion (shrink-fit). The solution can be very accurate, but is also quite cumbersome when it comes to tool changes. For example, on a Roland MDX-15 mill, you have to replace the entire spindle assembly to switch between two different diameters of the shank. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you have jaw chucks, similar to the solution seen in power drills. They can grip a wide range of tool diameters, but tend to suffer from poor eccentricity, and TIR is seldom better than 0.2 mm. For precision work and rigid CNC machines, that's a bad deal. A reasonable middle ground is a system that accommodates fixed-diameter collets fastened with a nut; the spindle has a single taper to accommodate a family of collets (e.g., ER16), and every collet is precision-ground to hold a specific diameter of a tool. Because collet changes are quick and the collets themselves are inexpensive, this is a good balance between accuracy and ease of use. The ER system is a particularly popular and dependable choice. What to buy: If you can get ER or a similar collet-based system, go for it. Otherwise, just make sure that the toolholding system is versatile enough to accommodate common shank sizes (3, 4, and 6 mm for metric cutters; 1/8" and 1/4" for imperial system tools), and will be sufficiently precise for your needs. 2.1.8. Availability of CAM software Manually programming your CNC machine is about as much fun as building a steamboat out of toothpicks. For a higher-level approach, you need to turn to CAM software: it automatically analyzes the provided geometry (created with any 3D modelling application) and converts it to a set of paths that need to be retraced by the tool to approximate the desired shape. Once these toolpaths are ready, the software then breaks them down into a sequence of painfully basic instructions that actually make sense to the controller embedded in the mill; say, "set speed to 12,000 RPM" or "move cutter to X = 10.245, Y = 5.000, Z = -2.000". The toolpath generation stage is largely hardware-agnostic; but the program generation one isn't. It's good to shop for a machine that speaks a common and well-documented language - or, lacking this, is popular enough to be supported by some of the best-known CAM apps. Keep in mind that even if the manufacturer bundles the mill with some starter software, you don't want to be left out in the cold if the application one day refuses to work with your new PC - or if it simply turns out to be of poor quality. The most common quasi-standard language used by almost all CNC mills is called G-code (aka "NC"). Calling it a real standard may be a stretch: there are very significant variations in how the syntax is implemented by the manufacturers. Still, having support for G-code spells rudimentary compatibility, or at least easy integration, with almost any CAM application on the market. For other languages, this is not always given. What to buy: check if the mill is supported by common third-party packages (Deskproto, VisualMILL, madCAM, MeshCAM, Mayka, etc); if it's not, and if it speaks something else than a clearly documented variant of G-code, be wary. 2.1.9. Size, weight, power needs We're almost done: the last thing to do is a quick reality check. Benchtop mills span from units no larger than an inkjet printer, to ones weighing in excess of 200 kg and taking up almost 1 x 1 m of desk space. When shopping for the larger models, be sure to account for their physical characteristics, and make sure you have a way to get them in your workshop to begin with (some doors are barely 70 cm wide). For heavier mills, it is also important to have a piece of sturdy furniture; it's not just the static load that you have to worry about, as the machine may also produce horizontal shear forces due to acceleration and deceleration of the cutting head. Not every wobbly desk from Ikea can handle that - but any proper workbench should. Benchtop mills usually run on standard, single-phase 110 / 230 VAC power supply, but of course, make sure to double-check. They may require several amps in peak, so you don't want them to share a single circuit with a vacuum cleaner, an electric kettle, or a space heater - especially in an older home. 2.1.10. And now, all the things you don't have to worry about Okay - that sums up the list of parameters that are worth looking at. There are also some characteristics that sound important, but usually aren't - so to help you decide, here's a quick list to consult when in doubt: Positioning accuracy: this value tells you how true the machine's idea of a millimeter is to a calibrated reference. The difference is usually negligible, and even if it wasn't, you can compensate in software without any special effort. Origin reproducibility: this indicates how good the machine is about resuming the same starting location after being power cycled. Not particularly important in normal work, unless your power goes out in the middle of a cutting job. Software resolution: unlikely to be lower than mechanical resolution, and fairly meaningless if it's higher. Motor power: spindle motors delivering as little as 75-100 W should be perfectly sufficient for the processes advocated in this guide. More powerful mills are beneficial chiefly in heavy-duty metal work. Table size: easy to confuse with the actual machinable area, but nowhere near as important. The difference between a 2 cm margin and a 10 cm one usually doesn't matter at all. List of millable materials: every mill should be able to cope with a wide variety of materials; don't read too much into the list provided by the manufacturer. Tool changer (ATC): it's a convenient device for unattended jobs, but it's usually not worth the expense in hobby work. It's nice, but unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket, you can do without it. Contact scanner accessory: contact scanning heads are a gadget available for some CNC mills, but chances are, you will use them to scan a couple of coins or pendants, and then lose all interest. For reverse engineering of mecanical designs, just using a caliper works a lot better, and takes less time. Noise ratings: probably not what you think. These parameters describe the noise produced by the mill when in standby mode (spindle off); or when operating, but not making contact with a workpiece. Benchtop mills are fairly quiet in no-load conditions; and even the most compact and underpowered devices can be pretty loud when actually machining something. The actual noise level will range from barely perceptible when working in waxes or using sub-mm cutters, to pretty unpleasant when rapidly plowing through metal with a large-diameter tool. In fact, just imagine the noise made by a saw or a drill. Well, that's probably it. If you spot any other puzzling parameters, please let me know. 2.1.11. So, which one should I buy?! That really depends on your budget and the scale of the projects you want to be working on. The manufacturers listed 2.1 are a starting point, but the market is evolving rapidly; I had some specific recommendations listed here in the initial version of the guide, but within two years, most of them were out of date. My best advice is to run some Google searches; if in doubt, check out forums such as /r/hobbycnc on Reddit, or simply drop me a mail. 2.2. Stocking up on end mills Ordering a CNC machine? Well, the next stop is getting some cutters. The selection available on the market is quite overwhelming, so to save you time and money, let's talk about some of the properties that set these tools apart. Oh, before we dive in... here's a drawing of a typical end mill, and all the lingo you will have to memorize soon: All right - so here are the differences you will see: Material: end mills are made either out of cobalt steel alloys (known as high speed steel, or HSS), or from tungsten carbide in a cobalt lattice (colloquially shortened to "carbide"). The latter option is considerably harder, more rigid, and more wear-resistant - and for the tool sizes we are interested in, carries a relatively small premium (30% or so). What to buy: Stick to carbide. Coatings: carbide cutters may be further coated with ceramics such as titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN, aka AlTiN), titanium nitride (TiN), titanium carbon nitride (TiCN), or with amorphous or crystalline diamond. The coatings tend to improve hardness or reduce friction; the bluish-gray TiAlN coating is probably the most common one. In non-abrasive plastics, this particular coating doesn't have a very pronounced effect, but it extends tool life by some 20% or so - and the cost is only 10% extra, so it's not a bad deal. Of course, in some situations, tool wear is a more pronounced concern; for example, glass or carbon fiber composites can leave a mark on carbide tools in a matter of hours. In the same vein, in ultra-precise micromachining, you may have to worry even about early-stage wear, because it can subtly affect the dimensions of the tool. In such cases, amorphous "diamond" coatings offer more definite benefits compared to TiAlN, often extending tool life by a factor of 2-3x. Alas, the coating at a 30%-40% premium and is available only for some tools. (True, crystalline diamond works, too, but costs a lot more and is reserved for more demanding jobs.) What to buy: If you're on a tight budget, skip any coatings and pocket the change. Otherwise, TiAlN or amorphous diamond is probably not a complete waste of money, although you can still skip it on your first set of "training wheel" tools. Tip geometry: precision machining operations in plastics will almost always rely on "vanilla", single-end finishing tools with no chip-breaking ridges, no taper, no coolant outlets, and so forth. The tips of these standard tools come in three basic flavors: Flat tip cutters are the primary tool in all sorts of mechanical work. Ball nose cutters come handy when you need to reproduce gentle slopes and other organic designs. And lastly, corner radius cutters offer a compromise design that combines 90° arcs in the corners, and a flat mid-section - but you can safely ignore them until you have a specific itch to scratch. About the only other type of a cutter worth mentioning here are conical engraving cutters, which look like this; these are useful for making very fine but shallow cuts, for example when machining traces on a PCB. What to buy: build a competent collection of flat tip cutters first. If you want to experiment, grab one or two ball nose cutters, but you probably won't be using them that much in non-artistic work. Cutting diameter: end mills come in cutting diameters from 0.01 mm (a lot thinner than human hair) to 50 mm and more. For most intents and purposes, cutters below 0.25 mm or so are just not very useful, unless you are doing some truly hardcore micromachining; and over 8 mm or so, they get too big to mount and meaningfully use on benchtop mills. Your cutters need to strike a sensible balance: large tools can't machine tiny features, but small tools remove very little material in every pass, making them useful mostly for selective refinishing work. In fact, a two-fold reduction in tool cutting diameter often translates to a 10-fold reduction in effective material removal speed! What to buy: try to get a 3 mm (or 1/8") cutter to handle most of the machining work; for large projects, 6 mm (or 1/4") may come handy, too. On top of that, keep 0.4 mm and 1 mm cutters for touching up fine details. Cutting diameter tolerance (tricky!): "1 mm" cutters don't always have a diameter of 1 mm. In a nod to the legacy of drilling and tapping applications, many manufacturers make their tools to non-symmetric tolerances, as denoted either with a pair of explicit values (say, +0.00 / -0.04 mm), or with an ISO tolerance code such as "e8". Of course, modern tool grinding machines are often a lot more precise than that; micron accuracy is not unheard of. The machine is therefore preset to simply crank out tools at the mid-point of the specified range. Using the example of a 1 mm tool specified as +0.00 / -0.04 mm, the actual diameter will end up being 0.98 mm or so. In most uses, you won't even notice - but then, every now and then, such a subtle difference can bite back. Okay, so the case of explicit tolerances is pretty clear; as for the "e8" case: for cutters with diameters below or equal to 3 mm, the offset is -0.021 mm. For cutters over 3 mm and up to 6 mm, the difference is -0.029 mm. What to buy: whatever you want, just make sure to double-check the tolerance, and write down the actual diameter of the tool. Also, if the vendor declares a suspiciously sloppy tolerance, approach such tools with caution, and perhaps ask the company if they mean it. Shank diameter: this is the diameter of the top portion of the end mill - the one that goes into the holder. It has no significant effect on the cutting process, so you simply need to make sure that you have a matching collet for all the tools you intend to buy. Cutting length: the cutter will have flutes extending only through some of its length. The height of the cutting region sets the upper limit of how deep the tool can be driven into the workpiece in a single pass. What to buy: for the processes outlined here, you typically only need the flutes to extend to a distance equal to about 50% of tool diameter. Because the flute-bearing section somewhat more vulnerable than the rest of the end mill, and may also be subject to uneven wear, it's actually beneficial to opt for stub-flute tools when you have a choice. Reach length: many end mills have a neck - a section between the flutes and the shank, across which the diameter of the tool does not exceed that of the cutting tip (and in most cases, is about 10% percent smaller). The distance from the tip of the tool to the end of this section puts an absolute limit on the depth of machining near any vertical walls: As you can see in the rightmost drawing, the problem can be avoided by introducing a non-zero draft angle: a subtle slant on any tall, vertical walls. Draft angles also help with removing cured parts from rigid molds - but are not always desirable or practical. That's why having a tool with a decent reach length is still a good plan. On the flip side, more is not always better: with miniature long-reach tools, as the neck gets longer, the cutter becomes more prone to deflection and easier to break. A 1 mm tool with a 3 mm reach can be operated with few worries; at 10 mm, you need to be a bit more careful; and at 30 mm, it starts to require ninja skills. Oh, of course, some tools don't have a neck to speak of; in these cases, there is a taper that immediately follows the flutes, and reach length is identical to cutting length. That may be good or bad, depending on whether flute length is sufficient for your needs. Note: there is an interesting special case - some 3 mm or 6 mm tools have shank diameter identical to their nominal cutting diameter; the same goes for their imperial 1/8" and 1/4" counterparts. You can think of them as having reach length equal to total tool length, minus about 20 mm needed for the collet. There are some drawbacks of driving these tools deeper than their cutting length, though: their pretend "neck" doesn't have a reduced diameter, so when dealing with zero draft angles, it may end up rubbing against the workpiece. This usually has no effect in prototyping plastics, but quickly becomes a problem in metals and other tough stuff. The situation gets slightly worse if the actual cutting diameter is smaller than the nominal one, due to non-symmetric tolerances. In these cases, driving such a tool too deep may have a minor but noticable impact on dimensional accuracy or surface finish. What to buy: moldmaking often involves relatively deep cuts and vertical walls. Make sure that your 3 mm tools have a reach of at least 20-30 mm; for 1 mm, stick closer to 10 mm; and for 0.4 mm, 2-4 mm should do the trick. Overall length (OAL): self-explanatory. Typical mold cutters have lengths of about 50 to 75 mm; some lower cost or subminiature tools may be available as 38 mm, too. Longer end mills - up to 150 mm or so - are also available, but seldom worth the price. The main significance of this parameter is that the tool will stick out of the spindle by no more than OAL, less something around 15 mm for the part that needs to be gripped by the collet. Life gets more complicated when the collet nut and the rest of the spindle gets in the vicinity of the workpiece, so it's preferable to have tools long enough to deal with the typical depth of the molds you are planning to work on. What to buy: if your projects will be anything like mine, your molds will probably range from about 6 to 22 mm in depth, with infrequent excursions down to 40 mm or so. If so, OAL of 50-75 mm is a good pick. Number of flutes: higher flute count translates to faster material removal rates and superior finish, because there are more cutting passes per every turn of the spindle. Unfortunately, there are modest limits to how many sufficiently robust flutes you can cram onto a small cutter, and still have enough room for swarf; 4 flutes are the common limit, although 6 are not unheard of. What to buy: for the materials we will be using for moldmaking, the more flutes, the better; at least three or four are strongly desirable on 3 mm cutters, and nice to have on smaller tools. For aluminum, rubbers, and malleable plastics, one or two flutes may be a better pick. Helix angle: zero degree flutes are perfectly straight, and run vertically along the tool. The industry standard is 30°, which offers a sensible balance between edge sharpness, vibration, and swarf removal speed. Lower angles are used to rapidly engage and remove softer materials (e.g., rubbers, thermoplastics); while higher angles improve tool life and reduce vibration in hard materials. What to buy: there is virtually no difference between 15, 30, 45, and 60° when working with easily machinable plastics; you can safely disregard this parameter, and just focus on finding the most interesting and the most affordable tool. Center cutting ability: almost all the cutters of interest to CNC work have a bottom flute that extends through the entire diameter of the tool - which allows it to be plunged straight down into the workpiece, and effectively act as a somewhat competent drill. But a small minority of end mills are not center-cutting, and can't be operated this way. You probably don't want that. What to buy: avoid non-center-cutting tools. Phew! My favorite tool manufacturer is Hanita (now a division of Kennametal, confusingly sold under the brand name of WIDIA): they have an unmatched selection of metric tools at reasonable prices, and are available all over the world. If you are in the States, Sierra Tool is a good reseller; Centerline Industrial is a bit cheaper, but for some reason, refuses to ship to residential addresses. And if you are anywhere in Europe, I can strongly recommend ordering Hanita products with ITC. Hanita aside, Harvey Tool has a very interesting selection of imperial system miniature tools in the US - and I found K&H Sales to be a dependable distributor. Other US manufacturers include OSG Tap & Die, Monster Tool, Micro100, and Microcut, but their catalogs are not as impressive. Readers in the EU may want to check out Nachreiner. Here are the catalogs of the three most interesting manufacturers: Hanita: full end mill range (most are "e8"). Harvey Tool: all tools (some have non-symmetrical tolerances). Nachreiner: carbide finishers. As for practical recommendations, I would suggest starting with Hanita 401403000, 402403000, or Harvey 73118-C4, as the baseline "3 mm" cutter ($15-$30); Hanita 7N2201021 or Harvey 76440-C3 for 1 mm work ($30-35); and Hanita 7N2200410 or Harvey 992515-C3 as a long-reach ~0.4 mm tool ($35). If you are not on a very tight budget, it makes sense to order two of each - it's easy to mess something up in the heat of initial experimentation. With the tools selected, you also need to make sure you have the right set of collets. For ER16, if you are not desperate to save a few bucks, try Rego-Fix "UP" (ultra-precision) collets; they retail for about $45 a pop, and are carried by K&H; another good option are "DNA" collets from Techniks (about $30, require a custom nut). You can find lower-cost collets from many other, more obscure brands - but they are not always particularly good. Oh, one more thing: for ER16, every collet has a specified clamping range - for example, 3.00-2.00 mm. It is always preferable to use the upper value: a 3.00-2.00 mm collet is better than a 4.00-3.00 one when holding a 3 mm tool. 2.3. Periodic testing and troubleshooting Before embracing any complex or high-precision projects, it is important to understand the performance of your mill, and see if anything needs to be fixed, adjusted, or compensated for. While CNC mills don't require constant tuning, making several simple measurements after unpacking the device can save you a lot of time. If you neglect this step, you will find that troubleshooting mill accuracy issues in complex, real-world projects tends to be a daunting task, simply due to the sheer number of variables to look at. The essential tool that you will need to perform the initial measurements is a micron-resolution dial indicator with a magnetic base. You can get a no-name unit on eBay for about $50 (link), or go with Mitutoyo or other reputable brand for about $220 (indicator, base). For lower-cost mills with a rotary tool acting as a spindle, you may be better served by a 0.01 mm indicator, though; in this case, you can get a Mitutoyo one for about $80 (link, base not included). 2.3.1. Spindle TIR The first thing to check is the runout of the spindle and the tool holder. Wipe clean the internal spindle taper and the collet (use WD-40 if there is any excess grease or other accummulated dirt; a small brass brush works well for any stubborn gunk), and install a tool that extends at least about 20-30 mm from the collet. Tighten until you feel definite resistance, but don't overdo it - excess force may deform the collet, and is not essential in lightweight work. Next, affix the dial indicator to the table or other sturdy surface, make the tip of the indicator touch the tool near the spindle, and observe the change in readings as you gently turn the spindle by hand, preferably at the top (the mill should be turned off, of course). Be very careful not to exert any unnecessary pressure on any of the parts. Let's call the result of this measurement Rcollet. Move the indicator about 10 mm lower (stay clear of the flutes) and repeat the test; we'll refer to it as Rmiddle. Finally, if possible, remove the tool and the collet, and reposition the indicator to make contact with the internal taper of the spindle (the measuring tip now pointing up). Repeat the procedure, and write down the result - Rtaper. Here's how to interpret the data: Rtaper: this measurement tells you about the concentricity of the spindle itself. If it is excessive, it may be time to service the spindle (e.g., adjust the internal tension spring; disassemble it and install a new pair of precision bearings; or, insert a shim somewhere to fine-tune the concentricity). Rcollet: if the spindle measurement looks OK (and only then!), this value helps you estimate the eccentricity contributed by the tool holder (on top of Rtaper). If the value is high, examine the collet for dirt and damage (again, WD-40 is a pretty good cleaning liquid). Small tool holder misalignment can be often "fixed" simply by adjusting the tightening torque, or applying a gentle pressure to the appropriate side of the tool when tightening the nut. If that doesn't help, replacing the collet - perhaps with a higher-quality model - may be the way to go. Rmiddle: this value lets you estimate the eccentricity at the tip of the tool, which ultimately, is the most important observation to make. You can see if the TIR is increasing, decreasing, or staying about the same in relation to Rcollet - and use that to extrapolate the apparent diameter of the tip. For a quality machine with a dedicated spindle and ultra-precision ER16 collects, after some adjustments, TIR should preferably stay within 2 µm or so; and for any mill, it is good to have runout within 0.01 mm. If you are seeing something much worse, poke around and see if you can improve it: it's usually simpler than it may seem. For example, the factory spindle that came with my MDX-540 mill had a TIR of about 6 µm; using a hook spanner to adjust the tension of the internal spring by one tenth of a turn reduced the value to 1 µm. In more complex cases, switching around or rearranging the existing bearings inside the spindle, or replacing them with new ones, will often do the trick. Tip: try to quickly repeat the Rcollet measurement after every tool change, even if you are not doing high-precision work. Trapped dirt will affect the concentricity of the tool holder, and even a tiny difference can easily reduce tool life by 50%, and increase cutting noise by more than that. 2.3.2. Axial alignment of the tool Spindle eccentricity aside, it is also useful to verify that the tool is truly perpendicular to the X-Y plane; if that's not the case, for example because one of the screws that attach the spindle to the rest of the mill is not tightened to the same torque, you may see somewhat perplexing dimensional errors in machined parts. The test you should perform is exceedingly simple: you need to mount a cutter that offers at least around 2-3 cm of clearance between the collet and the flutes; programmatically lower the spindle by 2 cm or so; and set up the dial indicator as shown on the previous drawing, in section 2.3.1. When done, gently rotate the tool to find the mid-point of its TIR, and then programmatically move the spindle up by about 1 cm. The same procedure should be repeated after repositioning the dial indicator to make contact with the side of the tool (rather than the front). If everything is fine, you should see no appreciable change in the values shown by the dial indicator; a few microns may be fine, but if the difference is getting close to 0.01 mm, you should definitely investigate. The issue is almost always trivial to fix: you may need to loosen the screws that hold the spindle in place, and perhaps insert a shim made out of aluminum foil on the offending side to straighten it out. Caution: before operating the mill, be sure to read the safety tips provided by the manufacturer, as well as the advice included in section 7 of this guide. Small CNC machines are not particularly deadly power tools, but they are still power tools - and it's your responsibility to use them safely. 2.3.3. Spindle vibration The spindle assembly is typically fairly heavy, and under normal operating conditions, will be rotating rapidly. At these speeds, any poorly balanced rotating part, any malfunctioning ball bearing, and any damaged transmission belt may easily introduce significant vibration - and that vibration will inevitably propagate to the end mill or the workpiece. It is difficult to accurately measure high-frequency vibration without the help of specialized tools, but this shouldn't stop you from performing two rudimentary checks. Try this: Attach your dial indicator to the table or other part of the mill frame, and let the tip touch any non-rotating part of the spindle. Run the spindle at several different speeds, and observe the reading; oscillation of the indicator hand, if any, should stay well under 1 µm. Remove the tool, grab a long screwdriver, and carefully touch any non-rotating part of the spindle with its tip. Be vigilant, and keep your body and the screwdriver itself well clear of any moving parts. When the tool is touching the spindle, you shouldn't be able to hear any ringing noise, or sense any appreciable vibration in the palm of your hand. If any of these tests reveals excessive vibration, the first thing to do is disenage the motor from the spindle (there's usually a belt or some sort of a clutch involved); if the problem doesn't go away, you know that the problem is with the motor itself, in which case, it may be useful to have it serviced or replaced. If the spindle is to blame, replacing the internal bearings would be the obvious next step. Whatever the cause is, fixes shouldn't be too expensive, but pinpointing the issue may take a while. 2.3.4. Repeat accuracy Repeat accuracy is the single most important factor limiting the precision of the parts you can make. Even if you are not planning to machine anything particularly intricate, this parameter is still worth checking: if it's alarmingly poor, it may be indicative of a problem with the mill. To estimate the accuracy of the machine, brace the tip of the dial indicator against the side of the spindle assembly, and then programmatically move the spindle away in the X axis, in 0.01 mm increments (or whatever the nearest multiple of your mill's mechanical resolution is supposed to be). After about 5-10 steps or so, reverse the direction, and gradually move back to the starting point. Here's what to look for: Every step should move the needle of the dial indicator by the same amount, ideally within 1 µm, and definitely within 0.01 mm. Jerky stepping may be due the increments not being a multiple of the actual hardware resolution of the mill, or due to wiring problems in the stepper motor. The actual travel distance, as measured by the dial indicator, should match the expected distance closely. If there's any substantial error that seem to be proportional to how far you are moving, your CNC software should let you compensate. The locations of the steps when moving away from the dial indicator should be the same as when moving back; and the spindle should return to the same starting position at the end of the test. Any observable offset is probably due to backlash - which should be in the micron range. There may be some limited ability to compensate for this in software (for example, your CNC application may offer low-level motor calibration settings), but it's not a silver bullet. Of course, try to repeat this procedure for all axes. If in any of them, repeat accuracy is worse than 0.01 mm, it may be good to talk to the manufacturer. 2.3.5. Deflection under load We're almost done! The last parameter of note is the loss of accuracy you can expect if the mill is braking or accelerating rapidly, or aggressively plowing through a difficult workpiece. The value depends on the rigidity of mill frame, and the type and quality of its linear motion systems. If it's poor, there is no reason to despair - but it means that you may have to slow down when doing precision work. The test here is extremely simple: with the mill on but the spindle turned off, brace the dial indicator against the side of the cutting head, and then use your hand to gently press the spindle from the other side - along the tested axis. Don't overdo it: the goal is to exert may be 20-50 g of force, and not to overcome the holding torque of the motors. In a quality mill, the momentary deflection should stay under 5 µm or so - but up to 0.02 mm is something you can live with. 2.4. Ongoing maintenance Once you know that your machine is behaving correctly, there isn't that much that needs to be done on an ongoing basis: it's a pretty sturdy piece of machinery, and it's usually not subject to heavy wear. Consult the manual for manufacturer-specific advice - but in most cases, the rules are pretty simple: Always keep the collets, cutters, and the spindle taper squeaky clean and lightly lubricated. Get rid of any thick, factory-applied grease (use WD-40 or naphtha to do that); carefully remove all cutting residues (use a small brass brush for any stubborn bits); and apply WD-40 or a similar low-viscosity oil to protect all these components against corrossion - especially after handling them with bare hands. Sweat residue can quickly lead to corrosion! Thoroughly vacuum the mill after every job. Cuttings, if allowed to pile on, may eventually make their way into the sensitive, normally shielded parts of the drivetrain - or more prosaically, may simply obstruct the movement of the table. Do not use compressed air for cleaning, as this can push dirt deeper into the machine, or just spread it around your workshop unnecessarily. Every few hundred hours of machining (1-2 years' worth of weekend projects), wipe old grease and dirt off of ball screws and linear guides, and apply a fresh coat. Medium-viscosity lithium grease is typically the right choice - but check the manual carefully, and whatever you do, avoid mixing lubricants of different kinds. After several thousand hours of use (5+ years), it may be time to inspect the spindle assembly for any obvious wear, loss of concentricity, noise, vibration, or elevated operating temperature - and service it as necessary. If you do it yourself, the replacement of spindle bearings should cost between $40 and $300, depending on the design. Some of the entry-level mills may be using low-cost brushed motors to power the spindle; such motors are a consumable, and may require a replacement after anywhere from 100 to 2,000 hours - but typically don't cost much. Higher end machines usually rely on brushless motors that should last a decade or more. Linear drivetrain motors, bearings, and so on are typically not subject to substantial wear when doing lightweight hobbyist work; if properly maintained, they should last pretty much forever. Insufficient lubrication or contamination with abrasive materials (ferrous metals, glass, etc) are about the only things to watch out for. 2.5. Cutter management If you are planning to do high-precision work, or simply wish to ensure high-quality surface finish when working with organic shapes, it's useful to measure and document the diameter of every new end mill in your collection. Although the tools are usually manufactured with micron-level accuracy, the specifications can sometimes be wrong, and on top of that, manufacturing variations may occur from batch to batch - for example, due to changes in the thickness of applied coatings or the gradual wear of the grinding tool. Case in point: some of my Harvey's 0.04 inch cutters actually measure around 1.022 mm, rather than the expected 1.016 mm. At these scales, such differences can bite. To perform the measurements, you will need an accurate micrometer. This tool, along with quality calipers, is one of the most important investments you will make, so don't fret: $50 will get you a decent no-name brand, while $140 is enough for Mitutoyo. For two- or four-flute tools, the idea is to gently tighten the jaws of the micrometer around the flutes, while simultaneously rotating the cutter (in the direction opposite to its normal operation) to find the maximum diameter. You need to stop as soon as you feel any resistance, to avoid breaking the tool or gouging the jaws; practice on larger, sturdy end mills before moving on to sub-mm ones. Three-flute tools are a bit harder to deal with. If the flutes are long enough, you may be able to grip the cutter so that one face of the micrometer is touching the peak points of two flutes, and the opposite face is touching the remaining one. That said, with stub-length tools, you may be essentially out of luck; doing a careful test cut and measuring the result may be the way to go (you need to account for TIR and repeat accuracy). Beyond the initial measurements, it is also a good habit to re-check your tools after every 10 hours of cutting or so, preferably measuring the diameter near the very tip. When doing heavy cutting, you may see some reduction in tool diameter as the outer edge of the flutes gets a bit more dull; for this reason, I suggest keeping your primary roughing tool separate from the finishing ones. Tip: even when working with plastics, applying several drops of a cutting fluid to the workpiece can improve finish and limit tool wear by keeping the tool cool and helping remove chips more efficiently - give it a try! For lightweight work, sulfur-free oils, such as Oatey 30200, work best. They are also easy to clean up with a detergent and don't interfere with resin casting work. Cutting fluids or no fluids, it makes sense to examine your tools for damage and excess wear every now and then. You can't trust your naked eye, but a simple 7x magnifier, selling for under $50, should do the trick. If you have a microscope with magnification between 10x and 50x, that's even better. Here are the two most common cutter failure modes that aren't visible with naked eye - significant wear (left) and a chipped flute (right): Both of these tools will still work, but the one on the left will not hold tight dimensional tolerances in particularly demanding applications; while the one on the right will produce crummy finish in machined parts and will be prone to gumming up. Tip: good bookkeeping is incredibly important in CNC work: computer-aided design and creative chaos simply don't mix. Cultivate good habits starting with end mills: make sure that you have a spreadsheet (or even a flat text file) listing all the tools you have, outlining their geometry, and making note of the measurements you have taken. Having such a list will not only help you avoid surprises, but will also make it easier to maintain a healthy stock of tools - so that you never have to put a project on hold for two weeks after accidentally breaking your last 0.4 mm end mill. 3. Mastering CAD and CAM By now, you should have a good idea of which mill to choose, where to find the cutters, and how it all fits together... or perhaps you own a 3D printer, and didn't read the previous chapter at all. Either way, the next step is getting comfortable with the software needed to bring your ideas to life. In this section, we'll go over some of the basics, and then proceed with a simple starter project of our own. 3.1. Computer-aided design (CAD) The primary function of CAD software is, quite simply, to let you design 3D parts. Your CAD application may be just about any general-purpose modeling program, such as Blender - but in the long haul, it makes sense to settle for a purpose-built tool. "Real" mechanical design software offers better control over part accuracy, and comes with powerful data input and analysis tools that streamline engineering work. On the flip side, they usually have less impressive rendering capabilities - and may come with no support for animation, physics, and other perks taken for granted in general-purpose 3D apps. For now, though, the distinction between general-purpose modeling tools and CAD isn't that important. You simply need to get comfortable with any 3D design software of your choice - and that takes a bit of work. 3.1.1. Wait, but which application to choose? A-ha, that's a good question indeed! In the previous edition of this guide, I tried to give an impartial overview of the market - but in the end, there is plenty of choice, and very few genuinely bad CAD tools. You can just look around, find the one you like and can afford. If you just want a simple recommendation - and are willing to spend some money on software to begin with - Rhino 3D is probably the best CAD package that you can get on a hobbyist budget. Students can purchase a fully-featured edu license for under $140, so if you are still in the academia, it would be foolish not to go for it. For mere mortals, there is a heftier price tag attached - $750 - so it's a more difficult call. Still, it's a mature and user-friendly tool that runs well even on low-end systems, and it's just done well - so you probably won't regret it. Now, if Rhino is priced outside your league, many people in the community are also fond of Alibre Design PE, which sells for about $100. Or, if you prefer not to spend any money at all, and can live with a somewhat clunky app, then FreeCAD looks fairly OK for simpler work. What else? Several accomplished DIYers use general-purpose 3D modeling tools such as Sketchup or Blender. The free-of-charge general-purpose tools are pretty diverse and mature; the only problem is that they may be less suited for complex work later on. If you are willing to cross that bridge when you come to it, they are definitely worth a try as a starter option. Last but not least, cash-strapped DIYers may also want to check out one of the "demo" editions of commercial CAD tools. For example, Creo Elements has a modest limit of 60 parts per document, but otherwise, should do the trick. 3.1.2. Some existential CAD advice We should probably start the lesson with a gentle warning: CAD programs tend to have a fairly steep learning curve. This is in part because you are forced to manipulate 3D objects using a 2D input device and a 2D display - and it takes a while to master that skill. The other problem is that these applications tend to use unfamiliar UI paradigms and obscure terminology - and even something as simple as right-clicking an object may have an unexpected result. It takes some effort to start using the software in a competent way - and if you're just banking on your innate abilities, you will probably learn to do things exactly the wrong way. If you want to make real progress, here are some rules to live by: Read the manual and do the tutorials. Trust me, you are not too good for this - even if you never had to do that with any other software. Set aside 2-3 days to go through all the exercises, and read the help pages. You need to understand what the program has to offer and what terminology it uses; even if you have some experience with 3D modeling software, you will learn a lot. Give your mouse a break. Try to do as much as possible without clicking around the UI. Learn command names and keyboard shortcuts, and make a habit of entering coordinates and dimensions manually. Find hotkeys for enabling, disabling, and changing grid and object snaps, changing drag modes, constraining movement, zooming and rotating viewports, and so on. This will save you plenty of time. Don't approximate. Never move objects around to make them just sort-of fit together. Learn to leverage object snaps, or use parametric operators to move, copy, rotate, or replicate objects with precision. If you don't, you will quickly start accummulating subtle geometry errors that will cause many 3D operations to unexpectedly fail later on (e.g., due to self-intersecting curves or imperceptible gaps). Don't believe in magic. CAD programs often come with advanced features to automatically calculate intersections or unions of 3D solids, place and remove holes, etc - but these functions aren't perfect, and tend to misbehave at least opportune times. Instead, learn to break down complex problems into simple steps, and operate on intuitive primitives (e.g., planar curves and surfaces) for as long as possible in the editing process. This also makes it easier to revise your designs later on. Before you start, there's just one more thing to do - you need to customize the program for precision work. Needless to say, the tolerances needed to design a building aren't the same as when designing a gearwheel - and CAD applications are used for both. For now, simply go through the configuration pages, and try to do the following: System units: set to millimeters. Or don't, but I find inches pretty unwieldy for precision work. Precision: set precision (or tolerance, or accuracy) to 0.5 µm (0.0005 mm) or so. Display mesh tolerance can be set to about 0.01 mm, simply to speed up rendering. Display grid: enable if necessary, and set major spacing to 5 mm, and minor spacing to 1 mm. Set grid size to match the work area of your machine. Snaps: disable object and angle snaps by default (you will be able to turn them on with a hotkey when necessary). Enable linear snaps and set distance to 0.5 mm. If the program supports it, turn on "planar" mode for snaps, where all the object snap points are projected to the construction plane of the current viewport. Viewports: switch to four-viewport display mode - showing top, front, and right sides of the model, plus a rotatable "perspective" (axonometric) view. Zoom in all viewports so that there are about 2-4 mm between the grid lines displayed on your screen. Shading mode: configure all viewports to use 3D shading, preferably with translucent surfaces (opacity around 80-90%; "ghosted" preset in Rhino), and with 1 pixel edge thickness. If possible, set a different edge color (e.g., red) for any "naked" edges that do not form a closed solid. Done? Then let's roll... 3.1.3. Drawing and manipulating simple planar shapes Your first job is to figure out how to draw several simple, two-dimensional shapes on the X-Y construction plane (i.e., using the "top" viewport of your CAD app). Try do to sketch all of the following: A single, straight line segment, A multi-segment zig-zag line (with sharp turns), A closed multi-segment line, where the end is joined with the beginning, A circle, using three methods: center point and diameter; two boundary points; and three boundary points, An arc - by selecting center point, diameter, and start / stop angles, A rectangle, using two methods: two corner points; or a center point and one corner, A polygon - circumscribed and inscribed, with a specified number of sides. Practice a bit; perhaps sketch a simplified, boxy outline of a car, complete with wheels. When you are comfortable with these 2D primitives, it's time for your next exercise: try to draw a smiley face without using your mouse at all. Type in the required commands and specify coordinates by hand; the display grid should be of great help. Oh - for some extra credit, add a hat! With your drawing in place, it's time to get familiar with several important operators. Figure out how to select one or more objects with your mouse, and then find the commands that perform the following tasks: Move selected objects by a specified distance in the current viewport, Duplicate ("clone") an object, likewise, Rotate object by a specified angle, around a selected point in the viewport, Flip (or "mirror") selected objects around a specified axis, Scale object proportionately in all directions, by a specified factor, Scale object in one direction only, Form an array of objects by cloning the selection at a given linear interval, Form a radial (polar) array by cloning the selection at an angular interval. Play around with these operators until you are comfortable with the way they work; pay special attention to scaling and rotation operators, and the way they are affected by the choice of the origin, reference point, and the viewport. As soon as you are done moving, flipping, and cloning stuff, locate and play with the analytic tools that let you do the following: Measure the distance between any two points, Measure the angle between two straight lines, Calculate the diameter (or radius) of a circle or an arc, Find the center point of a circle or an arc, Show maximum deviation between two similar curves, Compute the surface area of any closed curve. This is a good opportunity to experiment with object snaps, too: enable them temporarily, and check the various options they offer. In particular, be sure to give tangent snaps a try: draw three random circles, and then try to connect them with tangent lines, like this: Piece of cake? Thought so! You should be now ready to master several more complicated modeling skills. Note: Somewhat surprisingly, 2D drawing techniques are more important than any 3D sketching tools; in fact, you should resist the temptation to play with 3D primitives at this point. The bulk of mechanical modeling work is almost always done with spline curves, which are later converted into 3D objects with the help of operations such as extrusion, revolution, or lofting. We'll get to these operators soon. 3.1.4. The inner workings of splines Your CAD application probably stores every curve as a non-uniform rational B-spline. The visual representation of this mathematical model is not very easy to grasp, but getting a hang of it is essential to any sort of serious modeling work. In essence, every NURBS curve is defined by three parameters: Degree: this parameter defines how many control points will be simultaneously affecting the trajectory of the curve at any given location. Degree 1 curves allow just two points to have a say, with a linear transition between the starting and the destination point (i.e., a straight line). For degree 2 curves, the shape is influenced by three points, allowing it to have smooth bends. With degree 3, the number grows to four, and so on. Control points: every curve is accompanied by at least degree + 1 control points, to which it is progressively attracted to along its length. In degree 1 curves, control points simply lie on the curve (at the vertices). For degrees 2 and above, the points are often positioned outside the curve, forming a sort of an editable, elastic envelope, as shown below. Knots: these are the intervals along the length of the curve at which the influence of a previous control point ends, and the influence of a new one begins. Think of it as a way to pace the changes: densely packed knots can result in sharper turns. Note: it is possible to have multiple subsequent knots at the same location. If the number of knots in a cluster is equal to the degree of the curve, it's called a kink: it effectively forms a barrier that prevents control points on one side to have any influence over the other, and vice versa. This allows the curvature to change aburptly, forming a proper angle. Curves can be losslessly broken into separate segments at such a kink, too. An example of a degree 2 spline with no kinks is shown below; control points are marked in yellow, and knots are red: To practice a bit, try to locate the command that lets you draw a curve of a given degree by specifying subsequent control points. Get a hang of its behavior particularly for curve degrees 2 and 3. There should be also a separate command for creating interpolated curves that go through any number of specified "via" points that you click on, which may be useful for tracing around bitmaps and so forth. Oh, one more thing: using both of these tools, try to create a proper kink! When you are comfortable with drawing, experiment with the following curve-editing tools: Displaying and moving around control points for an existing curve, Adding and removing control points, inserting a kink, Non-uniform refitting, to simplify the curve or remove kinks while maintaining its approximate shape, Soft-editing a curve by dragging a selected point on its surface, Displaying curvature and continuity information - can you spot any exising kinks? Last but not least, be sure to familiarize yourself with the "explode" operator that splits curves at existing kinks (see what it does to a rectangle, circle, etc); and the "join" tool that merges adjacent curve endpoints to form a curve with kinks. 3.1.5. Curve trimming As should be apparent by now, NURBS curves can be separated and joined at kinks in a completely lossless manner: the underlying coefficients do not have to change, and there is no gradual reduction of accuracy if you repeat these operations 100 or 1,000 times. Unfortunately, in many cases, you will need to truncate curves at locations that do not correspond to any existing kink. In these situations, the CAD application will be usually forced to create a new curve with a different set of control points in the vicinity of the cut. This fitting process usually works very well, and the resulting deviation should be much smaller than your configured tolerance, but you should be aware that the operation does not come completely free. With that warning in mind, find the command that let you split a curve at a point where it intersects with another one, and experiment with it. For degrees higher than 1, you should be able to see the effect it has on the set of control points for the curve - and if you ask the program to calculate the deviation between the input and the output curve, it will probably give you a tiny but non-zero result. Examine the deviations for a couple of input curves to see what to expect in normal work. In addition to the curve splitting tool, there may be also a second operator that works roughly the same way, but lets you immediately delete (trim) the unwanted parts. It may sometimes save you a click, so if possible, get familiar with it. In any case, it's time for a brief exercise. Remember the command for drawing radial arrays? Try to combine that with splitting and trimming to arrive at a result such as this: Nice, eh? It's not quite a proper gearwheel, but we're pretty close. Note: as mentioned earlier, it is always preferable to use the simplest editing tools that still do the job. In particular, you should always favor the join, explode, refit, split, and trim operators over any features that, for example, automatically compute unions, differences, or intersections of 3D objects. Why? Well, these advanced tools quickly go bonkers if you have something as simple as two closely touching, parallel walls - not to mention accidental self-intersections, non-watertight curves or solids, etc. It's one thing if they just fail in an obvious way... but if the resulting error is subtle and goes unnoticed, you may end up having to redo a good chunk of your work later on. 3.1.6. Other curve tools We're almost done with curves - hooray! But before we go, there are three other, immensely useful editing tools that you should probably learn about: The fillet operator is applied to any angle (kink) on a curve, and replaces it with a specified radius. The trick is often used for engineering purposes: fillets serve as a stress relief in sharp corners and drastically improve their strength. But even more interestingly, filleting lets you capture the real-world result of machining a corner with an end mill of a given size - which is important for certain types of snap fits. This illustation shows the use of filleting to determine the actual shape of a machined part: Note: Of course, it's not that you can't make a competent acute angle with a CNC mill. For example, refinishing the one on the left with a 0.4 mm cutter would result in a deviation of barely 0.3 mm. Still, in many cases, it's more convenient to account for such intrinsic fillets in your designs, than it is to refinish the workpiece with a separate tool. Oh, one more thing: in situations where you don't control the shape of the mating part (lighter blue in the picture below), you can always resort to bone fillets, too: Chamfering is a similar operation, but it replaces the selected kink with a straight segment that starts at a specified distance from the vertex. Compared to fillets, chamfering may have a more desirable appearance, depending on the effect you are aiming for - and produces a much simpler 3D mesh. The last operator, offsetting, offers an interesting way to resize any shape: it creates a derived curve that consists of points at a particular, constant distance from the original geometry. It is quite different from traditional scaling, in the same way that gaining weight is different from growing bigger - and it comes quite handy for generating walls, undersizing or oversizing parts, and so forth. Well, that's really it! You may also want to explore tools that let you extend or close curves, or blend them with more fine-grained controls - but for most intents and purposes, we are ready to talk about something a bit cooler than that. 3.1.7. Creating simple surfaces Let's start building three-dimensional solids. It's simple: draw a closed curve, and then find the command that creates a planar surface from it. Examine the result, then check out what happens if you select two curves, one within another. What about separate or intersecting input curves? Examine failure modes of this operator, too: what if one of the input curves is at a slightly different Z level? What if the curve is open or self-intersects? Of course, the planar surface that you have just created is still, well, pretty flat. The next important operator to play with is extrusion: select your curve, and using the side view, select the extrusion height. Disable the creation of top and bottom "caps": we just need the side walls. Try to use the join operator to merge the flat base surface with the extruded wall. If it worked, you have pretty much mastered 3D work. Lets try a slightly more complicated exercise: That's pretty easy, eh? In fact, it's a lot simpler to construct shapes this way than it is to start with 3D primitives, and clumsily piece them together. But don't let it go to your head. Spend a few more minutes playing with extrusion: see what it does to open or self-intersecting curves, to multiple curves that overlap or aren't at the same Z level, and so on. You should also take this opportunity to experiment with the explode, split, and trim operators that you remember from your curve editing days. Draw two solids and make them overlap, then see if you can use the trim operator to remove all the overlapping internal sections, and join the resulting outer shells into a new, closed shape. Can you do the same to "subtract" one solid from another, or only keep the intersection? Find the analytic tool that lets you calculate the volume of each of the solids, and use it to double-check that your results check out. Oh, one more thing: can you trim surfaces with curves? Why not give it a try! These tools aside, there are several other advanced surface editing operators that you should be aware of; they are particularly important if you want to create organic shapes without having to think too much: Curve revolution: this operator lets you draw a surface by taking any curve, and rotating it around a specified axis, and letting it leave a trail in the 3D space. This is the method of choice for creating many simple shapes with axial symmetry - bottles, vases, cans, chess pieces, rings. In fact, try to create each one of these. Lofting: this mechanism lets you "drape" a surface through a series of curve outlines arranged in the 3D space. Think of it as the opposite of slicing. It comes handy in a variety of situations, including creating draft angles for molds, or adding a handle to a cup. Play with it a bit - it's fun: Sweeping: this tool lets you select a curve and drag it along a specified rail, generating a surface in the process. It can be seen as a generalized form of curve revolution (in which the rail is always circular). A more advanced version of this operator lets you use multiple rails, which allow variable scaling of the profile curve; or multiple profiles, thus also generalizing the loft operator. Blending, filleting, chamfering: equivalents of the curve editing tools that let you smoothen the edges of your solids. Blending is particularly useful for creating a smooth, variable-curvature joint: The list of useful operators goes on - for example, it's sometimes useful to extract edges from surfaces or solids, to place or remove holes, or to orient something on an oddly-shaped surface - but you can discover these on your own. For now, let's just have a quick look at how to manage your work. 3.1.8. Working with multiple objects It's one thing to sketch a nice 3D box - but any medium-scale project may easily consist of several hundred of such solids, often meshing closely and stacked in creative ways. If you don't manage your virtual workspace well, you will get overwhelmed, make mistakes, or both. The document management tools at your disposal will vary from one program to another, but you should familiarize yourself with at least the following: Grouping. This function lets you combine any number of objects into a single logical component that can be moved around and copied as a whole. Unlike trimming and joining, this operator does not require the objects to form a single solid - in fact, you can group completely disjoint things, such as curves, dimensions, and even light sources for the rendered scene. When necessary, the group can be opened, and its contents can be edited separately. This tool is very useful for conveniently creating serviceable parts from simpler, reusable solids. Note: some programs go beyond simple grouping, and let you instantiate objects loaded from a separate document. These instances are automatically updated to reflect any changes to the "master" document. I find this to be an overkill in my work, but your mileage may vary. Assigning to layers. Layers offer a simple way to centrally manage certain properties of objects, such as visibility or color, without merging them into a single blob. All objects or groups that comprise a named layer can be still accessed individually - although you can also select all members of a layer if so desired. You should use layers to keep track of all instances of any given part, or to denote other important information - for example, that a particular object represents a premade part not meant to be machined, or that it's only a visual aid. Locking and hiding. Objects or layers that get in the way of editing may be locked. This keeps them at least somewhat visible, but prevents any interaction: you can't accidentally select them or move them around. Hiding is a more radical alternative: it completely removes the affected items from view. Locking and hiding is typically best applied to layers, as it usually takes just a single click to toggle this parameter in the layer manager. For individual objects, hiding is useful predominantly for items that you are not planning to access again: for example, any construction curves that were already used to create all the solids you needed, but that are worth keeping around just in case you need to redo something later on. To get them back, you will need to activate a special mode that hides all the visible objects, shows all the hidden ones, and lets you select the ones you want to bring back to life. As soon as you are reasonably comfortable with object management, we can actually make a simple mold! 3.1.9. Practice time: let's show some love! Okay, it's time for some fun. Let's start by trying to draw a heart: Here's what's going on in that illustration: We draw a helper rectangle as a guide for the overall size of the part. This one is 23 mm wide and 20 mm tall. We then use object snaps to draw a vertical line through the middle of the part, which will be our axis of symmetry. Once the guides are sketched out, we add a 13 mm circle (slightly larger than half the rectangle), and align it with the edges of the box. You can use grid snaps for that. We draw an arc using object snaps. The beginning of the arc is tangent to the existing circle, the end is at the bottom of the center guide, and the diameter is manually entered as about 110 mm. We mirror the circle and the arc around the axis of symmetry. At this point, the symmetry guide is no longer necessary, so we delete it. We use the trim operator to remove the internal parts of the heart, and then delete the outer rectangle. Voila! Easy, right? Now, let's join all the curve segments, and turn the whole thing into a mold: See if you can figure out all the steps on your own. The final result should be a watertight box with dimensions around 33 x 30 x 8 cm. Its bottom left corner should be at coordinates (0, 0), and the top surface should be at 0 mm, likewise. The mold cavity should have a 4 mm clearance around the heart, and should be 7 mm deep. The heart itself should be resting at the bottom of the cavity, and should be 4 mm high (its top surface should be at -3 mm). If everything checks out - well, the good news is that you have yourself a master mold (aka a pattern). Now, we cut some corners with the moldmaking process, given the simplicity of this project, but this is how the entire thing usually plays out: Be sure to save that project - we'll need this file soon. 3.2. Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) CAM software reads the geometry created with your favorite modeling application, and turns it into toolpaths that can be sent to a milling machine, a 3D printer, or some other automated tool. All the computer-controlled manufacturing technologies use a common set of underlying concepts and have a comparable degree of complexity, but there are many details that remain specific to a particular tool. Since we have to choose one way or the other, the rest of this chapter will focus on the software designed for CNC mills. 3.2.1. Shopping for the right application When I first published the original version of this guide, the makers of CAM applications catered almost exclusively to commercial users. The software was ridiculously overpriced, shipped with archaic UIs, and always included a collection of mind-boggling bugs. Thankfully, the emergence of low-cost mills and serious hobbyists is slowly changing that. Still, there is no single package that would be a sure bet for all users, and you need to understand what sets them apart. Here's a quick list of the things that matter the most for everyday CNC work. 3.2.1.1. Support for fourth axis If you own a computer-controlled rotary axis, or plan on getting one, you should figure out which 4-axis machining modes are supported by the program - and decide if they are worth the extra price. The three fundamental choices are: Indexed cutting (XYZ): in this mode, every milling job is handled using traditional, planar three-axis movements. The only new trick is that the program will automatically rotate the workpiece (and the CAD model itself) in between jobs, letting you machine the part from multiple sides with no extra leg work. This rudimentary approach is probably the most useful one, particularly for engineering work. It works great on geometries that have a small number of distinct, planar faces - for example, a two-sided PCB, a nut, or a rectangular enclosure. Interestingly, indexed cutting is actually fairly easy to simulate by creating several CAD files with the same part rotated by the desired degree, generating toolpaths for each of these files, and then sending them to the mill and rotating the part in between. It takes a bit more time, and there's a higher risk of human error - but it's up to you to decide if the extra convenience is worth spending several hundred bucks extra on your CAM tool. Lathe-type machining (AXZ): in this mode, the Y axis is kept in a fixed position, so that the tool hovers directly over the axis of rotation, or stays at a predefined offset. The workpiece is turning continuously as the milling head is moving up, down, and to the sides. If you haven't seen a lathe in action, this video should clarify what's going on. Such an approach allows efficient reproduction of smooth, cylindrical shapes that would require indexed cuts from 6 or more sides to approximate the shape by traditional means. Examples may include threaded shafts, worm gears, soda bottles, or rings. Unlike the previous mode, this one can't be trivially approximated in a program that doesn't support it natively; but it's also not nearly as essential, not unless you're planning to work on jewelry or other artistic stuff. Fully simultaneous four axis machining (AXYZ): in this mode, the machine is free to move in all four axes while cutting, and the application analyzes the geometry to find the right balance between lathe-like and planar movements. This may result in more efficient machining of complex surfaces with variable curvature or hard-to-reach undercuts - but it's seldom of any use to begin with, and it can be approximated by alternating between the two techniques mentioned earlier; the extra cost is difficult to justify in hobbyist work. What to buy: your call. If indexed cutting is all you need, you may be able to live with lower-cost three-axis CAM. 3.2.1.2. 3D milling strategies Vendors of CAM software tend to be pretty creative about the range of specialized and obscure machining modes that they offer, but there are only three options that really matter; the rest is either redundant, or doesn't work well in complex molds. Here are the three methods in question; the first two really must be supported by the application you want to go with: Overhead projection: this method amounts to projecting a simple surface-filling pattern onto the workpiece, from the top. In the most basic case, the pattern may be just a bunch of evenly spaced parallel lines, connected together on alternating ends. The tool then follows these lines in the X-Y plane (X-A for lathe-style machining), and is lowered or raised as necessary to reproduce the shape of the part: Such a computationally inexpensive approach is particularly efficient when machining flat regions or very gentle slopes with a flat tip cutter; in this case, the spacing between projected lines (stepover) may be comparable to the diameter of the tool, and still produce excellent surface finish. Alas, the strategy is a bit less suitable as soon as the cutter gets near any vertical surfaces. If the wall is in a direction perpendicular to the toolpath, the process will leave scallops of uncut material, as shown above; the height of the scallop is equal to cutter_radius - sqrt(4 * cutter_radius² - stepover²) / 2. Walls that happen to be parallel to the direction of the cut will acquire a better finish, but the process may leave a layer of uncut material, up to stepover thick. Walls at other angles will get a combination of both artifacts. Note: both of these issues can be remedied to some extent without switching to a more advanced machining strategy. Scallop height can be managed with modest changes to stepover - for example, when using a 3 mm tool, changing stepover from 2 mm to 0.5 mm reduces scallop from 0.38 mm to 0.02 mm - that's a 20-fold improvement at the expense of slowing down by a factor of four. The other problem - with the accuracy of parallel walls - can be fixed by doing a second pass using lines projected at a different angle, so that the cut is no longer parallel in the previously affected area. Of course, the situation gets a lot trickier if you have walls at many different angles, or worse yet, any arcs. Good CAM software be able to not only generate linear projections, but also "offset" patterns that are constructed from an arbitrary outline provided by the user. This has some important benefits that we'll talk about soon; the end result looks kind of like this: Z axis slicing: also known as waterline cutting, this machining strategy starts by creating a stack of horizontal surfaces, evenly spaced in the Z axis. Each of these surfaces intersects the CAD model, and every such intersection results in a number of closed, two-dimensional outlines of the part. These outlines can be then offset for the size of the tool, checked for collisions, connected together, and used as a toolpath: This mode allows for faithful and highly efficient reproduction of intricate vertical features, such as spur gears. On the flip side, it does not do anything useful for horizontal surfaces; and produces staircase patterns on sloped surfaces, unless the spacing of Z levels is unreasonably tight - as seen above. On top of the basic mode with a constant Z step, some of the more expensive CAM programs allow you to automatically detect and optimize the spacing of Z levels based on the geometry of the part. That sounds nice in principle, but I could never get this feature to work in a sensible and consistent way in any of the programs I have tried. 3D draping: this method generates a toolpath that always maintains a particular distance between cuts, or keeps a particular scallop size, regardless of the shape of the machined part; this is somewhat akin to printing linear toolpaths on a piece of fabric, and then laying it over the geometry to be reproduced. This strategy can be a significant time saver when working with organic shapes using ball tip tools, but it is not commonly useful in everyday mechanical work. What to buy: the two first strategies must be supported unconditionally, and should come with no strings attached: you should have full control over how they are used and when. The third one is a plus. Advanced features of these modes, and other toolpath generation methods, matter a lot less. 3.2.1.3. Region selection capabilities Efficient machining of complex models requires the ability to decide which tool and which strategy will be applied to various regions of the model - and in what order. To facilitate this process, your CAM application should let you define a freeform region for every machining operation, either by selecting an existing boundary curve imported alongside with the 3D model - or by drawing something by hand. It should let you exclude regions within an existing selection by picking a second curve inside the first one, too. These capabilities are pretty much all that matters. You may notice that certain programs have the ability to automatically generate selections based on some property of the model - for example, to only machine flat surfaces, vertical walls, or something in between. These features are sometimes nice, but are usually more limited or less reliable than what you can do in CAD - so don't pay any special attention to this. What else? Oh - several programs offer "residual machining" of regions left over after the previous operation with a larger tool. This sounds great in theory, but is typically both fairly coarse and extremely slow; I tried two applications that supported this feature, and it misbehaved or ran out of memory more often than it proved to be useful. What to buy: curve-based selection is a must. Pay little or no attention to the rest. 3.2.1.4. Cut optimization Some CAM applications do not put any special thought into organizing the toolpath segments that are spewed out by the underlying geometry-analyzing algorithm. Depending on your model, the result of that can be pretty inefficient; for example, a waterline cut that sequentially machines every outline on every layer before moving further down will produce a total of 15 operations when machining these two separate holes (left): The image on the right shows a more sensible ordering: instead of going back and forth between the machined regions, finish one first, and then move to the other. The result is 9 operations, consisting mostly of short movements. Quite a few programs are capable of such common-sense optimizations - but not all. What to buy: it is useful to shop for CAM applications that offer cut optimization, especially for waterline machining. It's not an essential feature, but it's a major time saver. If in doubt, consult the manuals or ask the vendor before buying. 3.2.1.5. Arc interpolation G-code - the language supported by most of the CNC machines on the market - has several commands that can be used to execute circular, spiral, or helical movements of the tool. While support for these opcodes is not required, quite a few embedded controllers recognize them, and translate them to motion optimized for the hardware they are hooked up to. CAM programs, however, usually convert input files to polygon meshes, and generate toolpaths where arcs are broken into thousands of small, linear movements. This practice is not just a waste of electrons, but may result in lower machining speeds, because it hinders the ability for the controller to plan ahead and pick the best acceleration and braking strategy. Perhaps more annoying is that if the pitch of the generated 3D mesh doesn't overlap with the hardware resolution of the motors in your CNC mill, needless vibration may be introduced, too. What to buy: If your machine supports arc interpolation, it is good for the CAM program to know how to generate G-code that leverages that. It's not a deal-breaker, but something really nice to have. 3.2.1.5. Cut direction control There are some brief moments in the cutting process where the tool may be pluging head-on into uncut material. Most of the time, though, the tool simply works to widen existing pockets, and engages the material one side at a time. There are two principal configurations possible during that task: In the conventional (aka upcut) mode, contact with the workpiece is made on the left side of the tool, in relation to the direction of movement. Toolpaths generated this way allow the material to be engaged very gradually, starting with a near-zero chip load, and ramping it up. This strategy is less dependent on the rigidity of the tool and the workpiece, and results in superior dimensional accuracy and surface finish with rigid plastics and many other types of easily machinable materials. In the climb (downcut) mode, the orientation of the tool in relation to the workpiece is reversed, and every flute plunges into the material to start at the maximum chip load, and then have it taper off. This approach puts greater strain on the tool - and if the tool or the workpiece deflects, it reduces the dimensional accuracy of the final part. That said, it may offer better cutting speeds or improved surface finish in certain annoying materials - such as metal alloys prone to work hardening, or soft, malleable thermoplastics. In waterline cutting, maintaining a specific direction of cuts comes naturally, and at no extra cost; in fact, it takes special effort to alternate the type of cut between each layer. Overhead projection strategies are more problematic: if the projected pattern is just a bunch of parallel lines, the only way to achieve consistent direction is to cut the first line, raise the tool, move back to the starting side, lower the tool, and make the next cut - in short, there's a lot of non-cutting movements. And that's the major advantage of "offset", spiral-like projections that we have mentioned earlier on: they permit the direction to be maintained without having to raise the tool. What to buy: you should make sure that the software gives you full control over the direction of cut for every machining strategy of note. Not having this ability will make your life miserable, especially when working with miniature, long-reach tools that flex easily. 3.2.1.6. Input and output formats Last but not least, the application you end up choosing needs to support the file formats that can be written by your CAD package. The most common interchange formats include IGES and STEP (both of which are vendor-agnostic); DXF and DWF (originating with AutoCAD); 3DM (Rhino3D); and STL (3D Systems); support for at least one of these is good news - and the more, the better. NURBS surfaces are supported natively in all of these except for STL and DXF, where approximate tessellation may be required. Input formats aside, you also need to confirm that the application actually supports your CNC mill, and can generate suitable output files. If your machine speaks G-code, and the application offers the ability to create custom G-code postprocessors, you may be able to find a third-party converter or write your own one with relatively little effort; otherwise, you need to make sure that the mill is supported out of the box. 3.2.1.7. ...and all the things you don't have to worry about Here's a short and incomplete list of things that tend to appear in product specifications and may seem important, but typically don't matter much: 2.5D machining strategies: these features are used to convert bitmaps and other 2D input data into engravings, simple cutouts, etc. They are truly useful only if you don't have a CAD application to begin with, which obviously won't be the case. Support for drilling, tapping, boring, and so on: when working in plastics, it makes virtually no sense to buy specialized tools and use exotic toolpaths to make holes and perform similar tasks; end mills, operated the usual way, will almost always do. Manual toolpath editing: this ability may be useful for very simple models, where the toolpaths are trivial, and fixing them by hand may be a convenient alternative to reworking the model. Toolpaths in complex molds are nearly impenetrable, though. Visualization support: the ability to simulate the machining process is a nice addition, especially when making your baby steps with CAM, or when dealing with buggy software - but ultimately, it's not worth the extra price. Once you work out a sensible machining workflow, the results are almost always easy to predict. Collision detection: this lets you prevent cuts where the tool taper or collet holder would hit the workpiece, because you miscalculated the reach of the tool. This is useful chiefly if you have a machine with an automatic tool changer; otherwise, adjusting collision detection settings after every tool change is about as problematic as configuring the toolpath correctly to begin with. Support for workpiece approach methods: center-cutting tools can work as drills, but aren't particularly competent in this role; plunging them directly into tough materials may reduce their life expectancy quite a bit, especially if the cutter has a flat tip. This can be solved by generating toolpaths where the tool enters at an angle - that said, for easily machinable plastics, it's pretty much a non-issue. Cutting wizards, libraries of materials, etc: while these seem cool, they are generally tailored at simple industrial applications or other beginner work. Configuring the parameters manually is almost always a safer bet. Drawing, part editing, and analysis tools: having these capabilities available in a CAM package is useful only if you don't have them in your CAD application - but that, again, shouldn't be the case here. Of course, feel free to ping me if you stumbled upon any other cool-sounding feature, and need help figuring out what it's worth. 3.2.1.8. All right - so which CAM package is good for me? Well, it's complicated. For starters, your CNC machine may come with a basic CAM application, and that package may turn out to be good enough for starter jobs. For example, Modela Player 4 - the application that comes with Roland mills - is pretty decent. That said, in the long haul, you will probably want to upgrade to something more featured and flexible. Somewhat lamentably, there aren't that many free-of-charge applications that would be easy to use yet powerful enough; FreeMill is one potential choice, but it only supports a single, rudimentary machining strategy - and really, isn't worth much. This leaves you with commercial tools. If you are on a tight budget, you may want to check out MeshCAM ($200), which is actually a very competent package with good technical support. Other alternatives within that price range include Cut 3D, or the hobby license for DeskProto. I have tried both DeskProto and MeshCAM, and both of them are pretty good - so these would be my top picks. Other than that, there are quite a few other reputable choices with prices hovering around $1,000 and more. The pricing in the "pro" segment, especially for more featured packages with 4-axis machining, is still rooted in the era of strictly-industrial CNC - but deep discounts are available to students, and sometimes, to those who buy the software along with the mill itself. Notable applications in this category include VisualMILL / RhinoCAM, Alibre CAM Mayka, madCAM, and quite a few more. If money is no object, or if you can get a good discount, you may want to dig deeper. If you need advice, I've seen VisualMILL in action, and it looked pretty good. Tip: many of the commercial packages have demo versions. These demos are either limited to a 30-day trial, or lack the ability to write G-code, but are otherwise fully-featured - so be sure to check them out before you buy. 3.2.2. First minutes with CAM CAM programs can be counterintuitive; you will probably need to read the manual carefully to even understand how to create a toolpath, or write the resulting NC file. These applications are also often finicky, unforgiving, and buggy - so it's important to take it slow, and check everything twice. Before loading your 3D models, you need to configure the software for your particular machine, either by selecting the appropriate postprocessor, or - in the worst case - by writing your own based on an existing config file for a similar mill (not as scary as it sounds, as long as your machine came with a code reference manual). You should also go through all the configuration options, and make sure that units are set to millimeters, that the tolerance is 1 µm or better, that arc interpolation is enabled if supported by your hardware, and that the G-code coordinate system is set to G54 (the first, default user-configurable coordinate system, and the only one you will be using in hobby work). With this out of the way, you should load the geometry to be cut. Let's use the heart-shaped mold created earlier on; if you need to export it from your CAD application to a mesh-based format, such as DXF or STL, be sure to configure meshing tolerance to 1 µm or better for that step, too, as this setting is often separate from the global value. Once the model is loaded, you need to verify its position. For three-axis work, the mold cavity should be facing up, and the top surface should be aligned with the Z=0 plane in the CAM application; when looking from the top, the bottom left corner of the mold needs to be at X=0, Y=0, too. If it wasn't loaded this way, you can move or rotate it as needed, but also try to figure out what went wrong: is your original CAD model oriented correctly? If that's not the reason, is there a CAM-level option you should have toggled at import time? Well, all right. Once the model is in the right spot, it's time to create some toolpaths next. 3.2.3. Roughing toolpaths To maintain sanity, it helps to split the cutting process into several phases. Each of these phases accomplishes a different task, and may use a different tool, feed speed, machining strategy, stepover distance, and so forth. The first phase of almost every project is known roughing; its goal is to remove the bulk of the material as efficiently as possible. Of course, astute readers may ask why this isn't also the final step - and the answer is that, quite simply, heavy chip loads and rapid tool speeds offer limited accuracy; it's better to leave a small margin of uncut material, and refinish the surface in a separate process later on. The usual roughing strategy is a hybrid approach where the model is cut in Z layers, and on every layer, the application first uses a pattern of horizontal movements to clear the pockets, and then performs a waterline-type cleanup pass. Once the first level is done, the toolpath advances to the next one: In some applications, roughing may not include that cleanup pass, in which case, you should probably configure a separate waterline step right after roughing. This is to ensure that the margin of remaining material is reasonably uniform, so that chip loads don't fluctuate wildly later on. Tip: good CAM applications let you use pocket-shaped offset cuts, rather than linear movements; this completely eliminates the need for the waterline cleanup pass. If that mode is offered by your software, take advantage of it - it will speed up the process and also let you maintain a consistent direction of cuts. In any case, for the materials used in this guide, you should configure the roughing process the following way: Tool size: use a 3 mm or 1/8" flat tip cutter, but lie to the application and give it a diameter about 15% higher (say, 3.5 mm). This will cause the toolpath to be slightly farther away from the workpiece than actually makes sense for the tool - thus creating a margin for roughing in the X-Y plane. Tool length offset: tell the program to pretend that the tool is about 5% of tool diameter longer than set on the machine (effectively moving the toolpath up). This introduces a similar margin in the Z axis. (If not supported by the application, you can make this adjustment simply by setting Z origin a bit higher than measured.) Roughing margin: set to zero. Using tool size and length offset is usually more intuitive, especially for toolpaths where you want to have an offset only in a specific direction. Stepover: something between 30% and 50% of tool diameter should do. You can ramp it up even higher, but there's no real need to do so in this case. Z level spacing: set to 1 mm. Especially if the value is high, it should at least vaguely correspond to the spacing of key features of the mold in the Z axis. Tolerance / sampling resolution: for roughing, can be safely set to around 0.01 mm or so, to reduce processing time. Machining speed: use maximum spindle RPM; feed per tooth should be about 0.08 mm (i.e., 2,000 mm/min with four flutes at 6,000 RPM). Cut direction: when using offset cuts, use conventional cutting with the tool first engaging at the center of each pocket. When using linear cuts, set to bidirectional (meander) mode. No special approach strategy required. Machining region: set so that the cutter stays completely within the envelope of our mold, and does not attempt to trace around it. Note that depending on your CAM application, selection regions may work in one of three ways: Tool fully inside: the cutter must stay completely within the bounds of the selection. Nothing that lies outside the region will be machined. Protrusions that lie within the selected area, but are closer than tool_diameter to the boundary, will not be fully profiled, as the tool won't be able to pass between them and the limiting curve. Tool center inside: the center point of the end mill is required to stay inside the selection, but the tool itself can stick out slightly. Features up to tool_diameter / 2 away from the selection can be machined by the tool if necessary. Protrusions within the selection must be at least that far from the boundary to be fully profiled. Tool touches selection: the tool is free to roam anywhere as long as any point of its geometry stays within the selected region. In this mode, features within tool_diameter from the boundary may be machined. Everything within the selection is cut. It doesn't really matter which selection philosophy the application happens to use, as long as you are aware of its behavior, and can plan accordingly. If you are still not sure what's going on, check out this image; teal denotes the desired geometry, the selection rectangle is cyan, and the remaining unwanted material is red: Well, that's pretty much it. Once the roughing operation is set up, simply tell the program to calculate the toolpath, and examine the result closely. Make sure that it actually makes sense: is the tool staying within our virtual workpiece? Do the toolpaths look anything like what we discussed before? If the program can give you estimated machining time, is it less than 10 minutes or so? If everything checks out, congratulations; now, let's finish this thing. 3.2.4. Finishing toolpaths Finishing toolpaths typically refine the geometry in several consecutive steps: The vertical (Z axis) margin on flat surfaces is removed using a projection toolpath that has a zero tool height offset, but preserves the original tool diameter offset from the roughing process. The X-Y plane margin around vertical features is removed using properly spaced waterline cuts, configured with the true diameter of the tool. If there are any sloped surfaces, they are locally refinished using a tightly spaced projection toolpath or 3D draping, possibly with a ball end tool (this is not applicable to our model). If there are any holes or tight pockets that couldn't be faithfully reproduced with the current cutter, they are selectively refinished with a smaller one. To take care of the first item on this list, you'd normally want to configure an offset-type, projection finishing toolpath with the following parameters: Tool size: about 2-5% higher than the value used for roughing (3.6 mm or so). Tool length offset and margin: both set to zero. Stepover: not critical; 1 mm is a safe bet. Tolerance / sampling resolution: 0.5 µm or so. Machining speed: maximum RPM; feed speed should be about 0.05 mm per tooth (i.e., 1,500 mm/min with four flutes at 6,000 RPM). Cut direction: conventional if using offset cuts. Otherwise, for parallel toolpaths, use bidirectional cutting mode to save time. Machining region: restrict to the inside of the mold cavity. Make sure that the generated toolpath doesn't climb the sides of the cavity, as this would be a no-op. This step cleans up the flats; now, we need to take care of the walls. This is done with a "pure" waterline toolpath that traces around vertical shapes, and does nothing more. The parameters for this step should be: Tool size: enter the actual, measured diameter of the tool. It's good hygiene to include TIR, if known. Z distance: set to 0.5 mm. In general, this must coincide with the spacing of vertical features of the mold, and shouldn't be too large (to avoid high chip loads). Any features that are not aligned with this parameter may need to be refinished separately. Machining region: restrict to the inside of the pocket. This time, make sure that the outer walls of the pocket will be machined. Starting height: 0 mm. Always double-check this parameter for waterline toolpaths, as rouding errors may sometimes prompt the CAM application to default to something dubious. Everything else should be the same as for the previous step. Well, that's almost it. After this toolpath, the heart should be looking pretty much the way we designed it - with just one minor blemish: center kink in the middle of the heart will have a slight fillet on the top, due to our relatively large 3 mm tool not being able to fully squeeze into that tight spot. To fix this problem, we can perform a selective waterline cut with a 1 mm end mill. Most of the parameters don't change from step #2, except: Tool size: enter the actual, TIR-compensated diameter of the new tool. Z distance: use 0.25 mm. Speed: maximum RPM, feed of around 0.035 mm per tooth should be fine (that's around 450 mm/min with two flutes at 6,000 RPM). Machining region: make a rectangular or circular selection extending a few millimeters around the problematic kink. And... well, that's it! Generate the toolpaths and pat yourself on the back. For future reference: here's the list of maximum recommended cutting parameters for the tools you should have bought. These values are applicable only to several classes easily machinable prototyping materials that we're going to talk about soon - when working in more demanding stock, you will need to slow down: 0.4 mm: feed 0.01 mm/tooth, 0.125 mm cut depth, 0.125 mm stepover, 1 mm: feed 0.035 mm/tooth, 0.25 mm cut depth, 0.4 mm stepover, 3 mm: feed 0.1 mm/tooth, 1 mm cut depth, 2 mm stepover, 6 mm: feed 0.2 mm/tooth, 3 mm cut depth, 5 mm stepover. Speeds reduced by 20-40% are recommended for finishing operations, especially with 3 mm and 6 mm tools. 3.2.5. Final sanity check Measure twice, cut once. Before sending any data to the machine, it's always good to recheck your work; 5 minutes of that may save you several hours of troubleshooting in the physical realm. Here are some questions to ask yourself: Have you entered all the values correctly? Confirm tool diameters, stepover, Z distance, and feed speeds. A missing zero or a misplaced decimal point can cost you $20 for a broken tool. Do the toolpaths look OK? Anything that seems weird, suboptimal, or that exits the expected machining envelope? Any places where the toolpath seems to go straight through the geometry? Run a simulation if possible, and inspect the model from all sides. Have you covered everything that needs machining? Are there any spots where toolpaths do not reach, even though you wanted them to? For selective refinishing, have you selected all the regions you wanted to clean up? It's embarrassing to miss a spot. Is there any risk of collisions? Are the toolpaths suitable, given the reach of the tools you are going to use? Are all the traverse movements happening well above the workpiece? Several CAM programs make it easy to misconfigure this, and plunge through an essential part of your work. Try to use that checklist until you are reasonably comfortable with the process; it's not that mistakes are common, but they can strike at inopportune times. If everything checks out, you need to get the toolpaths ready for cutting. In some programs (e.g., Modela Player), the output is done directly from the application - in which case, just sit tight. In many other apps, the data is written to a text file, and that file is then sent to the machine using a separate CNC utility; if so, export ("post") the toolpaths now. Of course, remember to save the toolpath for the 1 mm tool in a separate file! 3.3. Please, let's cut stuff already! Okay, okay - but first, you need a suitable workpiece. We will cover more permanent options shortly, but for your initial tests, I strongly recommend getting something called machinable wax. It is a hard, rigid, wax-like substance, technically a blend of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and paraffin. It is not the cheapest or most durable stock, but has two important properties: it machines quickly to a very good finish with excellent dimensional accuracy; and more importantly, because it's much softer and more fragile than common plastics, even fairly major mistakes won't immediately result in a broken tool. In the States, the material is available cheaply from the folks at MachinableWax.com. I would suggest ordering their set #17-424215 (featured on this page). It's a box of 12 pieces, 42 x 42 x 15 mm, selling for $21. Don't overdo it - this really isn't the best or the most cost-efficient material for real work, so get just a single box or two. The only other thing you need in advance is a way to secure the wax to the milling table. Your mill may have come with some sort of a clamping system, or at least slots or screw holes that let you rig something together after a quick trip to the hardware store. Alternatively, you may want to consider MWHS01 from High Tech Systems ($100), which is a very versatile and lightweight system of clamps that should work for almost any medium or large CNC mill. That said, when working with easily machinable materials and using small tools, you can also get away with strong, thin double-sided tape, such as 3M 444 or Tesa 4965. Simply place four short strips in the corners of the workpiece, and press it down; then lift one of the corners to detach. 3.3.1. Setting up a job Assuming you have all the necessary supplies, we can mount the workpiece at this point. Wipe clean the table and the stock material, apply the double-sided tape as described earlier, and attach the workpiece to the table, making sure that it's entirely within the working area of the mill. Depending on the design of the machine and the length of the tool, you may need to put something underneath the workpiece to allow the cutter to reach it, too. Next, confirm that the workpiece is actually attached securely, and install your 3 mm tool in the collet. Tighten the tool holder, quickly confirm the TIR, and make sure that there is some clearance between the tool and the top of the workpiece when the spindle is fully retracted. Assuming everything is fine, you can now turn on the mill and let it initialize. Caution: I am assuming that, as requested earlier on, you have familiarized yourself with the operating manual of your mill, and with the safety tips information included in section 7 of this guide. As with any power tool, you can get hurt if you are careless. For G-code mills, the next step is to set the coordinate system to G54, then move the tool to align it with the bottom left corner of the workpiece (looking from the top), plus about 5 mm. With the tool at this X-Y location, tell the machine to set its X and Y origins; this is done in a hardware-specific fashion. Setting the Z origin is the last hurdle to deal with. Find a convenient location on the workpiece, in a region that won't be removed in the cutting process. If the machine has a tool sensor, simply place it underneath the tool, and follow the manual to perform the measurement. Without a sensor, you can use the trick we talked about earlier on: place a thin strip of paper or foil on top of the workpiece, and wiggle it back and forth while lowering the tool; use increments of 0.05 mm when you are close, and stop the moment the tool pinches the foil. Set the Z origin in that location; oh, and try not to pinch your hand instead! Done? Well, in that case, it's time to put on safety glasses, perhaps put several dabs of cutting oil in the region to be cut, and then hit "send" and output the 3 mm roughing and finishing toolpaths to the machine. With any luck, several minutes later, the machining process should be wrapped up. Vacuum off a bit and inspect the result; is the shape in line with what we're expecting? If yes, let's fix the kink: install the 1 mm tool, check TIR, redo the tool height measurement (very important), and hit "send" to output the remaining toolpath on your list. In case you are wondering, there are very few things that can go wrong with the cutting process itself, and all of them should be fairly self-explanatory. For example, if the machine starts cutting at an unexpected location, or too high / too low in relation to the workpiece, you probably messed up setting the origins, selecting the right coordinate system, or had the CAM model positioned incorrectly. Similarly, if the tool breaks while cutting in the expected location, this is probably due to grossly incorrect RPM, feed speed, or cut-in depth; or bad ordering of toolpaths. But chances are, you won't run into any issues just yet, so sit back and relax! Note: as hinted earlier, for more complex jobs, it's useful to keep the roughing end mill and the finishing cutter separate, even if both processes call for the same diameter of the tool. This way, you don't have to worry about the loss of micron-scale accuracy as the roughing end mill begins to wear - and you will be able to use both tools for a lot longer. 3.3.2. Inspection and troubleshooting As soon as you're done, detach the mold and vacuum in thoroughly. Machinable wax sometimes requires a gentle but firm cleaning with a brush and a touch of compressed air to get rid of the somewhat sticky chips - so do that, and then have a closer look. Is the surface silk smooth? Do you see any pronounced tool marks or gouges on vertical surfaces? What about horizontal ones? Do the dimensions check out when you use a caliper? (In more complex projects, pin gage sets are useful for measuring the diameter of small holes, too.) Chances are, you're in good shape - but if anything is even slightly wrong, now would be the right time to track the problem down; don't wait until you're working on more time-consuming projects, or in less forgiving materials. Here are several causes of the problems you are most likely to see: Tool ploughing through an essential part of the geometry: this may be due to poorly configured toolpaths; failure to adjust Z origin after tool change; axis stepper motor overload in open-loop machines; or sending a cutting job while the tool is positioned below the top of the workpiece (not all CAM applications prefix the generated toolpath with an instruction to retract the cutter). Double-check that the workpiece is still properly attached, too. Significant dimensional inaccuracy: this is usually caused by incorrectly specified tool diameter, excessive TIR, misaligned spindle axis, incorrectly secured workpiece, or poor mill calibration. The last problem will be directly proportional to the size of the machined feature, and if so, can be measured and compensated for in software. Substantial tool marks or gouges: these defects are typically due to high TIR, excessive speeds, or high chip loads during finishing (e.g., due to incorrect choice of toolpaths). Sometimes, lowering RPM is all you need. Very poor overall appearance of the mold: this may be due to unsuitable stock material (e.g., certain types of soft, malleable thermoplastics); using a bent or chipped tool; using a drill instead of an end mill; or having the workpiece partly detach from the table in the middle of the cutting job. Still, in all likelihood, the result will be fine. If that's the case, let's wrap up by reviewing some common-sense rules that come handy in mold design, just so that you are well-equipped to work on your next CNC project - and then, let's cast a mold. 3.4. Things to avoid in mold design There are relatively few real constraints on what you can cut on your milling machine, but there are several simple design strategies you should follow to keep the cutting process simple and quick, and make accurate, durable, and dimensionally accurate molds. Here's the gist of it: To speed up toolpath calculations, always choose straight lines over arcs when you can. For example, you may want to opt for simple, manually drawn shapes for mold cavities, or use chamfering instead of filleting to provide reliefs in places where aesthetics do not matter. This keeps the resulting 3D mesh a lot simpler, and can dramatically improve the speed of CAM work. To simplify the cutting process, it's good to maintain a reasonably consistent margin between each of the parts inside the mold, and between parts and the walls of the mold cavity. Use a distance that is slightly higher than the diameter of the tool entered for the roughing process. To help with waterline cutting, it's useful to align most of the vertical features present in the mold to 0.5 mm or so. This minimizes the need for selective remachining of individual parts. When dealing with parts of vastly different part heights, it may be desirable to create several separate mold cavities, instead of trying to cram everything into a single one. Using a shallow cavity for all the small parts will often save you time and materials. It's preferable to avoid holes and slots that have a size exactly matching the diameter of the tool that will be used to cut them; due to rounding errors, such situations can confuse your CAM software, and make it hard to generate a valid toolpath. Allowing at least 1% wiggle room is a good idea. Any small, deep holes that reach the very bottom of the master pattern should have their depth reduced by about 0.1 mm. This eliminates the risk that the resulting protrusion of the flexible negative mold will rub against the top cover used in the casting process, and deflect. The resulting 0.1 mm film is very easy to remove from the final part. You need to allow some headroom between the top of the mold cavity, and the top of the tallest part laid out on the inside; this forms the bottom surface of the resulting negative mold. Allowance of around 2-3 mm is usually OK. Deep molds (over 10-15 mm or so) benefit from draft angles on their outer walls (a slight slant, created using the offset and loft operators). Introducing several 5 mm deep pull tabs on the edges of the mold may be helpful, too. Large-volume parts should use molds that are scaled up accordingly, and have more generous margins and headroom, to support the weight of the resin and the mold itself. Well, that's it. It may sound overwhelming, but once you catch a whiff of it, even remarkably complex multi-part molds are fairly easy to crank out. We'll cover this and several other advanced design topics later on - but for now, let's have some fun with polymers! 4. Resin casting and you As discussed in section 1.3 of this guide, resin casting is a pretty amazing, simple, and user-friendly process that comes equally handy in CNC prototyping, 3D printing, and in manual DIY work; all its sophisticated uses aside, you will end up using it to replace broken parts in appliances or toys, make unique gifts, or even encapsulate backyard flowers or bugs (don't deny it). Alas, the online market for moldmaking and casting supplies is dominated by several companies that cater chiefly to artistic users, and sell expensive products with poor mechanical properties and little utility in high-precision engineering work. In that spirit, even if you are familiar with artistic resin casting using epoxies, polyester resins, or polyurethanes from Alumilite, Smooth-On, and similar sources, you will be probably surprised by how much better your results can get. 4.1. Raw materials 4.1.1. Machinable stock Well, before we dive into the world of casting resins, we should briefly revisit the choice of materials you can use to make master patterns. This part of this chapter is specific to projects that rely on CNC milling, so if you are interested in replicating manually crafted or 3D printed parts, you may want to skip ahead a page or two (this site provides a good overview of how to build patterns by hand - and if you have any other questions, feel free to drop me a mail or stop by /r/resincasting). Still here? All right! Of course, milling machines are not particularly fussy, and will cut almost anything that is softer than tungsten carbide, but rigid enough to stay in one place; still, some materials are more predictable than others, and produce better results. Prime choices include rigid engineering plastics such as polyurethane, epoxy, polyester, ABS, polyamide (Nylon), or acetal (Delrin); many varieties of hard woords; aluminum, brass, and other soft metals and alloys; and more exotic choices such as printed circuit boards, hard waxes, plaster, etc. Conversely, common materials that machine with greater difficulty or offer sub-par surface finish include stringy, low-melt thermoplastics (PET, polycarbonate, some grades of polyethylene); rubbers and other stretchy or squishy polymers (including some grades of PVC and most polystyrene foams); plywood and particle boards (including MDF); and exceptionally hard or highly abrasive stuff, such as steel, stone, or glass. Of course, many of these materials can be still cast or formed using CNC-machined molds and dies. Poor choice of working materials is one of the most common mistakes made by hobbyist machinists; quite a few people stick to workpieces that offer poor accuracy, get damaged easily, gum up the tool, or simply cost way too much. For moldmaking purposes, your best bet is one of the little-known materials: an extremely accurate, low cost piece of plastic known as a medium-density modelling board, originally devised for the automotive industry. It's essentially a mix of medium strength polyurethane, and a combination of soft fillers such as calcium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide. There are many types of machinable boards, but the one we are interested in has a density of about 0.70-0.78 g/cm³, and vaguely resembles wood: Prototyping boards of this particular variety include Huntsman RenShape 460 (or sligthly less dense BM 5460), Axson ProLab 65, Sika SikaBlock M700, BCC MB2001, Necuron Necumer 651, and several more. The material is typically sold in bulk, in sheets of about 50 x 150 cm, 25 mm thick. This may sound like a lot, but I recommend buying a full board, rather than grossly overpriced cut-to-size bits. The material lasts me for about a year, and costs about $12 per liter (roughly $250 for the whole thing). It's much less than what you'd pay for a similar slab of HDPE or acrylic - and it machines easier, too. (Planks of dense hard wood, when glued together and planed, may be a cheaper alternative for uncomplicated parts.) Buying prototyping boards is actually pretty easy. If you are in the US, you can simply go to Freeman Supply, and order RenShape 460 online (search for item #075229). In other places, simply look at the manufacturers' websites and find local distributors, then send out several e-mails or make some calls (online ordering isn't common in the industrial world). Be aware that prices may vary significantly, so shop around. Alongside with the board, you may want to order a matching board repair putty; it's a fast-curing, polyester compound that can be used to fix minor damage to your molds, or even completely fill a previously created cavity to reuse a particular workpiece for a new project. If you are ordering online with Freeman, go with their Quik-Fil; otherwise, ask the distributor for a matching product - they will be able to advise. What else? Oh, about the only minor drawback of the medium-density boards is that they have a very fine but perceptible grain, as shown in this magnified image: This grain normally has no appreciable effect on dimensional accuracy, but imparts a satin finish that will transfer to any transparent, water-clear parts. Of course, you can create high-gloss molds by coating the pattern with paste wax or a similar sealer (carnauba wax is particularly good); or you can always simply polish the final part - but both these options affect dimensional accuracy, and can be annoying when working on complex molds. The alternative is to use a more expensive material known as a tooling board - made out of solid, dense polyurethane, with no perceptible grain. Boards such as RenShape 5169 or BM 5272 cost up to 50% more, need to be machined 20-40% slower, and cause some wear to the tool - but they scratch this particular itch. Note: RenShape 460 is relatively easy to cut with a hand saw; in fact, it's comparable to soft woods. That said, the extra labor may be annoying in the long haul, so it makes sense to have a decent jigsaw nearby. You can get one for around $35; blades designed for hard woods will cut the material very quickly and last for years. 4.1.2. Silicone rubbers In order to replicate the parts laid out inside your pattern cavity, you need a flexible and durable substance to take an impression of the desired shape, and use it as a mold for the final product of your work. There are several types of castable rubbers that could be useful for this purpose, but silicones are hard to beat. There are quite a few formulations that combine ease of use, excellent mechanical properties, perfect dimensional accuracy, no odor, no toxicity, and temperature resistance up to 300° C. On top of that, silicones come with an inherently non-stick surface, which helps greatly in casting work. Almost all the silicone formulations you can find on the market come as a viscous goo consisting of long, linear, partly polymerized chains of siloxanes; that nominally non-reactive soup is then combined with a suitable cross-linker and a catalyst. The reaction between these components quickly turns the goo into a very bouncy solid; this can be initiated in several ways: Room temperature vulcanizing, one component rubber (RTV-1): these substances undergo hydrolysis when exposed to atmospheric humidity. This reaction creates unstable molecules that promptly bind to each other, and release acetic acid or a simple alcohol as a byproduct (hence the trademark smell of the silicone sealants from a hardware store). This reaction, known as condensation polymerization, has the unfortunate effect of subtly affecting dimensional accuracy of the part - simply due to the release of volatile molecules. That said, the main reason why this process isn't popular for moldmaking is more prosaic: it's just that thicker layers take forever to set, owing to their limited exposure to air. High-temperature vulcanizing silicones (HTV): here, condensation polymerization occurs in presence of free radicals, which are liberated from a heated organic peroxide. The suitable curing temperature hovers around 100-150° C. This method is sweet and simple, but also has a fatal side effect: the coefficient of thermal expansion for silicones is pretty high, around 0.025%/°C - and so, after cooling down, the dimensions will be off by several percent. This makes HTV rubbers completely useless for precision work. (It is possible to use radiation or UV light instead of heat, but that's not very practical in most cases.) Room temperature, two-component rubber (RTV-2): Condensation cure: these rubbers polymerize at room temperature in presence of an organotin compound (typically dibutyltin dilaurate), which is mixed into the system shortly before pouring it all into a mold. The catalyst itself is fairly harmful, has a characteristic smell, and will leach out of the rubber in small amounts. Tin-cured silicones are popular in hobby work, but I don't recommend them; organotin aside, they exhibit measurable shrinkage (around 0.5%), have inferior mechanical properties, and are prone to cure reversal after 1-2 years or so. Addition cure: these silicones are catalyzed with a platinum complex, and polymeryze with no byproducts whatsoever. The materials are safe and odor-free, and the finished product has practically no shrinkage, exhibits superb mechanical characteristics, and can be stored indefinitely. Platinum cure rubbers are commonly used in medical and food handling applications, and are the prime choice for flexible molds. In other words, you almost certainly want to stick to RTV-2 platinum-catalyzed silicones, unless you are working on life-sized castings (at that point, the cost of silicone can become prohibitive). Before discussing specific products, let's have a quick look at the notable characteristics that will come up in product datasheets for these rubbers, and review their significance to our work: Stiffness: the rubber we are going to use needs to be flexible enough to allow easy demolding of finished parts, but must be sufficiently rigid to maintain dimensional accuracy when laid on a flat surface, filled with liquid resin, and clamped or weighed down until the plastic is fully cured. There is no single, consistently advertised parameter that would give you a good idea of how flexible a particular rubber is, but this can be inferred in two relatively simple ways: Indentation hardness: this parameter is measured using an ad hoc scale known as "Shore A", named so after its inventor. The test involves pressing a flat-tipped 0.8 mm needle into a sample with a modest force (800 gf). Deflection of 2.5 mm or more corresponds to 0 on the scale, while no deflection whatsoever is denoted with the value of 100. Indentation hardness is a relatively poor proxy for rigidity, but is the primary key by which silicones are sorted in any catalog. In general, silicones under 10 Shore A are jello-like, and are used chiefly for special effects, soft bicycle seats, and - why not - sex toys. Compositions around 20-40A are fairly stretchy and squishy, similar to a rubber band. Silicones around 60-80A are still flexible, but begin to resemble a pencil eraser or a tire - you can flex them, but you won't stretch them easily. What to buy: rubbers starting from 20 Shore A are marketed as suitable for moldmaking, but I strongly recommend using around 60A for small, dimensionally accurate molds; rubbers under 40 Shore A are not advisable, except for large-scale work or for certain manual moldmaking techniques. Tensile strength vs elongation at break: if you need a more accurate picture of flexibility, looking at these values is a better approach - especially when comparing silicones to other types of rubber-like elastomers that we'll talk about soon. In essence, tensile strength tells you the stress (force divided by the area of cross-section) that causes the material to either snap, or to develop a localized defect known as necking. Elongation at break, on the other hand, describes the extent to which a standardized specimen can be stretched before breaking apart. If you divide tensile strength expressed as MPa (1 MPa = 145 psi) by elongation at break expressed as a ratio (1 + elongation / 100%), you will get a somewhat arbitrary but useful value that will be low for squishy rubbers, and high for rigid ones. (There is also a proper way to measure stiffness - Young's modulus - but it's not very commonly seen in silicone datasheets.) What to buy: unless you are working with very large or very deep molds, try to select a rubber where this calculated "stiffness coefficient" is at least 2 MPa. Ratios up to 3 MPa are OK for most uses; values around 4 MPa make sense only for relatively shallow molds where dimensional accuracy is paramount. Tear strength: removing cured parts from the mold inevitably involves some non-uniform pulling in the vicinity of sharp corners and other tight spots. In these cases, tensile strength does not accurately describe the resilience of the molding material; tear strength testing, which involves pulling a sample apart near the edge, offers a much better insight. The test used in the States is usually ASTM D624 die B, which involves a sample nicked with a razor; in Europe, a different method, similar to ASTM D624 die C, is more popular. There is no general mapping between these tests, but for moldmaking silicones specifically, the results given by the European approach (BS903 part A3) tend to be 30% lower or so. What to buy: tear strength of at least around 15-20 kN/m, as per ASTM method, is highly desirable (the value corresponds to force divided by the thickness of the sample; 1 kN/m = 5.7 ppi). Formulations up to 30 kN/m are available on the market, and are certainly not a waste of money. It's best to stay away from products where the advertised tear strength less than 12 kN/m or so. Mixed viscosity: rheology of a liquid is a complex topic and remains very difficult to fully parametrize, but within a single family of products, formulations with lower dynamic viscosity are generally easier to mix, pour, and degas - and will be more inclined to conform to complex shapes without the aid of vacuum or pressure. Silicone rubbers suitable for moldmaking start around 10,000 mPa*s; this viscosity resembles a runny syrup, and is very easy to work with. Compositions that go over 35,000 mPa*s or so are more prone to air entrapment when mixing the components, and when pouring them into a mold; the use of vacuum degassing is advisable for any complex work. Finally, once you cross 100,000 mPa*s, almost any silicone becomes fairly painful to work with. What to buy: all other things being roughly equal, go with the system with the lowest viscosity. Products below 50,000 mPa*s are advisable, but not strictly a must. Pot life and demold time: RTV-2 formulations begin to polymeryze the moment you mix the two components together; the point at which it the mix becomes so thick that it is no longer free-flowing or self-leveling is known as pot life or gel time. In the same vein, the point at which it is sufficiently cross-linked to be safe to remove from the master is referred to as demold time. Both of these values must be chosen so that the product can be worked with at a reasonable pace. What to buy: pot life of around 30 minutes in the bare minimum for low viscosity compositions; for medium and high viscosity, 50-90 minutes is preferable, because every step of the casting process will take a bit longer. Demold time should be as short as possible; I'd stay clear of any formulations that require more than 24 hours to set. Note: the speed of this and many other chemical reactions roughly doubles with every 10° C. If you are in a rush and don't care about some minor thermal expansion, using moderate heat is a great way to have your molds ready in 2-3 hours or so. Shrinkage: addition cure silicones used for moldmaking purposes should have no measurable shrinkage. Some manufacturers simply say "none", while others say "less than 0.1%" or so. Seeing a higher value in the datasheet is a warning sign; shrinkages between 0.2% and 0.6% are commonly seen in condensation cure silicones, and should be avoided in precision work. Color: moldmaking silicones are usually opaque beige in their virgin state, and can be pigmented easily. Systems in such a neutral color come handy if you wish to use the rubber not only for molds, but also to make functional parts (tires, etc). Sadly, many of the moldmaking compositions are artificially dyed blue, red, or green, to help novice users mix the components properly. That aside, there are several silicone formulations that are nearly transparent. The product is never water clear, and will have a slight milky haze; it will also lose transparency if exposed to high temperatures. Because of this, it's not particularly suitable for decorative purposes, but can be indispensable for non-CNC replication work, where you often need to see the submerged master part, and carefully cut the mold to recover it. The major downside of transparent silicones is that they have somewhat different flow characteristics, and can be difficult to degas. What to buy: I would not consider color to be the most important factor - if necessary, polyurethane elastomers offer a good alternative for making functional parts. That said, if you have a choice, it certainly doesn't hurt to go with something that can be pigmented easily. All right, that's it! Other parameters are either uninteresting, or are not advertised consistently. To help you with the selection process, my top recommendations for mechanical projects would be: Best overall properties: Quantum Silicones QM 262. This is a pale blue, opaque rubber with low viscosity (35,000 mPa*s), hardness around 65A, 12 hour demold time, and high strength. Hobby Silicone is a reputable distributor, so give them a try. In Europe and some other markets, Bluestar Silicones RTV 3460 is a decent, but considerably more viscous, alternative. Transparent / pigmentable: Silicones Inc P-592 (formerly known as XP-592). Truly exceptional tear strength, good price, medium viscosity (50,000 mPa*s), hardness in the vicinity of 60 Shore A, more challenging to degas. Cures in about 12 hours. You can order this product through Innovative Polymers, along with some of the other items we'll cover in the next section. High rigidity: Quantum Silicones QM 270, also sold as ACC Silicones QM270 in Europe. Neutral beige or turquoise rubber around 75 Shore A, excellent mechanical properties and manageable viscosity (50,000 mPa*s). Remains easy to degas. Somewhat less suitable for deep molds, undercuts, and in other applications requiring a stretchy material - but its great for small, high-precision parts. Super-low viscosity: Quantum Silicones QM 237. Around 40 Shore A, very easy to mix and pour (10,000 mPa*s), properties are still acceptable for typical molds. If you live in Europe, you may want to check out ACC Silicones MM242, which is pretty similar and comes in a transparent variety. You should pick just one of these; if you're undecided, go with QM 262 or P-592. If you need other options... well, Silicones Inc and Quantum are the most interesting US-based companies I know of. Other choices include Polytek, GT Products, BJB, and Smooth-On - but in my opinion, their selection is much less impressive, and the options I have tried pale in comparison with the ones mentioned on the recommended list. US market aside, globally, Bluestar Silicones (Rhodia) is fairly ubiquitous; you may also want to check out ShinEtsu, Wacker, Zhermack, Huntsman, Axson, or Dow Corning - depending on where you are located, they all offer some interesting choices. But then, one reader living in Norway reported that placing an international order with Hobby Silicone for QM 262 actually turned out to be much cheaper than locally available alternatives (whoa). As far as pricing goes, platinum cure silicones cost around $35-$45/liter when bought in one liter cans, or about $30-$35/liter in 4-5 liter pails; for example, P-592 costs around $120 for 4 l, while QM 270 and QM 262 in 5 l quantities fetch $140 and $170, respectively. Unreacted liquids should survive at least 2-3 years without significant deterioration, as long as you keep them in tightly closed containers, away from sunlight, moisture, and excess heat - so getting a full pail is not a bad idea. Note: resin manufacturers in the States use a somewhat confusing scheme for describing the size of their two-component kits: "1 gallon kit" usually means that you are getting about one gallon of whichever component is needed in greater quantity; and a matching amount of the other one. If the mix ratio is 10:1 (as is the case with most platinum cure silicones), the gain is minimal - but for resins mixed 1:1, you are actually buying two gallons or so. To further confuse you, the same does not apply to sizes specified in pounds - "15 lbs" means that you are getting just enough to cast a 15 lbs blob of plastic or rubber. Be sure to account for these differences when shopping around: a lower price is not always a better deal. 4.1.3. Rigid polyurethanes All right, let's talk about the materials you can employ to actually make final parts! Polyurethanes are an incredibly interesting and versatile class of two-component, addition cure polymers. They use two principal reagents, mixed in comparable quantities: a non-volatile isocyanate and a complex alcohol (polyol). Some formulations trade some or all of the polyol for a polyetheramine, resulting in a material that is more properly called a polyurea. In any case, the two components are usually combined with variable amounts of chain modifiers, usually chemically similar to the primary polyol; and possibly surfactants, plasticizers, fillers, and so on. The whole thing is then catalyzed with a wide variety of organometallic compounds (bismuth, zinc, tin, zirconium, aluminum, or similar); with tertiary amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO / TEDA); with diazoles such as 1,2-dimethylimidazole (DMI); or with something pretty close to that. Modern polyurethane chemistry lets you manufacture everything from soft foams, to high-performance rubbers, to faithful, often superior imitations of many other rigid engineering plastics - all that without having to go bankrupt on injection molding equipment, and while using only fairly safe and predictable chemicals. They greatly outperform more familiar resins, such as epoxies or polyesters, and in hobbyist workshops, are much less dangerous to work with. The only downside of high-performance polyurethane systems is that they generally require a basic vacuum rig - a small pump and a suitable container to remove any dissolved gases from the mix. Products that do not require degassing are readily available, but usually don't perform as well as their peers. (We'll talk about the required harware later on, but it's pretty compact and doesn't cost a lot.) Anyway - if you are aiming to make functional prototypes, it is probably prudent to start by stocking up on a polyurethane resin that lets you produce hard, rigid, and shock-resistant parts. Once more, let's have a look at some of the key things worth highlighting in a datasheet: Stated purpose: there is a lot of variety in the world of polyurethanes, and not all the properties of a material can accurately captured with several cold, dry numbers alone. You should always pay attention to what the manufacturer is trying to tell you: if they are talking about simulating engineering plastics such as ABS, polyamide, or polyolefins - great. If they are instead paying undue attention to tooling fixtures, conceptual prototypes, scale models, etc, be wary. This may mean that the resin has disproportionately low strength in thin sections, is very brittle, or suffers from other malady. If in doubt, simply talk to them and clarify. For the same reason, tread carefully if the resin is designated strictly for meter-mix machines, vacuum assisted casting equipment, or something of that sort. It may mean that the material is very difficult to degas, has an annoyingly short pot life, or requires a heated mold. That label is not always a problem, but 75% of the time, it's there for a reason. As usual, when in doubt, ask. It's often also possible to get a sample and try it out yourself. Hardness: indentation hardness of rigid plastics is typically measured using a scale called "Shore D". This approach is very similar to the one used for rubbers, except that it relies on a sharper tip (0.1 mm) and a greater force (4,500 g). Indentation hardness doesn't necessarily map to rigidity, or any other useful property - but since it's always listed prominently, use it as a very rough selection criteria: plastics under 75 Shore D are unlikely to be strong enough for making thin-walled parts. Flexural properties: almost all the prototyping work you may end up doing will probably benefit from a plastic that withstands high bending forces without snapping in half; and that maintains as much rigidity as possible under such a load. These qualities are measured using two values: flexural strength and flexural modulus. The first one describes the force in relation to part dimensions at which a standardized specimen breaks; the other one tells you the ratio between the stress the material is under, and its degree of deformation. The higher it is, the more rigid the part will seem. In comparison to these two, compressive and tensile properties usually matter a lot less in small-scale prototyping work. What to buy: aim high. Look for flexural strength around 90-120 MPa, and for flexural modulus somewhere between 2.5 and 3.1 GPa. This is roughly comparable or better than tough materials such as ABS (Lego bricks), polyamide (plastic gears), polycarbonate (CDs and DVDs), or acrylic glass. For a comparison of common plastics, this website is a great starting point. Impact resistance: flexural strength of a polymer is important, but doesn't paint a complete picture. For example, polypropylene is a relatively flimsy plastic, with flexural strength less than 40% that of acrylic glass; yet, Tupperware made out of PP easily survives being dropped to the floor, while acrylic glass of the same thickness and shape would likely shatter right away. The difference is that, especially in thin sections, polypropylene has a much better ability to flex and dissipate the energy of a localized shock; this is usually measured using a test known as notched Izod impact strength, where a pendulum swings and breaks an upward-facing, notched sample in its path; the test estimates the energy lost by the pendulum, in proportion of the thickness of the specimen (minus the depth of the notch). Lo and behold - the strength of acrylic glass is barely 15 J/m (1 J/m = 0.0187 ft-lbs/in), while various grades of polypropylene vary between 100 and 300 J/m. Impact strength matters more often than you might expect. For example, tiny gears subjected to sudden torque variations when braking will be more prone to failing catastrophically if the material has poor resistance to such shocks. Most rigid polyurethanes have Izod impact strength around 30-50 J/m, resembling Nylon, polystyrene, and so forth: they will perform well, but if you step on a medium size, very thin-walled part, it will probably break. There are quite a few formulations closer to 100-300 J/m, resembling plastics such as ABS; if you ever stepped on a Lego brick, you probably know that it prevails, at the expense of your foot. What to buy: your primary resins used for functional prototypes should have impact strength of at least 30 J/m; if the value is not provided by the manufacturer, it's probably lower than that. You typically don't need much higher figures, but if you have a choice, getting something closer to 100 J/m doesn't hurt. Shrinkage: this parameter is somewhat important in polyurethanes, because in some circumstances, it may significantly affect the dimensions of your parts. Alas, the standardized test is essentially meaningless. Polyurethane polymerization reaction has virtually no inherent shrinkage, but can be fairly exothermic; thermal expansion of the liquid, and the response of the flexible mold that surrounds it, is what may mess up the final result. In general, coefficient of thermal expansion for rigid polyurethanes is about five times lower than that of silicone (perhaps 0.005%/°C); when using sensibly selected resins, the exotherm in thin parts will not exceed 5-10° C above room temperature, and the resulting shrinkage will be practically nil, no matter what the datasheet says. On the flip side, when dealing with parts that have thick cross-sections, the temperature may peak 50° C over ambient - and at that point, dimensional accuracy in the most easily deflected portion of the mold will suffer. For example, when casting a solid block of resin with dimensions of 10 x 10 x 30 mm, and using a sealed rubber mold and a resin with 10 minute pot life, the most vulnerable point in the mid-section of the mold may be off by as much as 0.3 mm (3%). The rest of the part will be probably spot on. Luckily, it is within your power to change this. We'll talk about this in more detail later on, but in essence, you can: Slow down the reaction. The boring option is to switch to a system with a pot life of 30-50 minutes, and overnight cure - as these will usually have negligible exotherm even for bulkier castings. The more exciting option is to get rid of some of the catalyst present in the product, which usually involves adding a common and reasonably safe chemical to the system. It's simpler than it sounds. Partly prepolymerize the resin. Pre-mixing the full amount of isocyanate with about 10-20% of the intended amount of polyol, and setting this mixture aside for about an hour or two, will minimize the exotherm later on, likely reducing shrinkage by 70-90%. This has several other benefits, too, and the only side effect is increased viscosity. Add an inert filler to act as a moderator. Well-chosen additives allow you to reduce shrinkage by at least 30% without significantly compromising flexural properties of the system; going up to 80-90% is possible if you are willing to make some performance trade-offs. Allow some extra resin to flow back into the mold as the system cools down. Adding sprues or vents allows shrinkage to be offset without deforming the mold, and can result in dimensional accuracy improved by 80% or more. Cast in several layers. This eliminates shrinkage almost completely, but works well only with relatively simple shapes. The approaches can be combined, often with synergistic results. It is also possible to let shrinkage happen, but direct it toward non-essential locations; this can be accomplished by intentionally weakening a section of the mold, for example by using thin walls. The bottom line is that you don't have to worry a lot - but you need to be aware of this behavior, and need to know how to reduce it when necessary. What to buy: all in all, don't read too much into the datasheet, but be wary of resins with very high stated shrinkage - unless that shrinkage is measured by the manufacturer for a sample that is cured at an elevated temperature. For samples that spend the first few hours or days at room temperature, advertised shrinkage should be less than 0.3% or so. Beyond that, comparisons are somewhat pointless. Mixed viscosity: flow characteristics of polyurethanes are very different from silicones, possibly due to higher surface tension; on top of that, polyurethanes usually have much shorter pot life. Because of that, resins under 1,000 mPa*s are preferred; products over 2,000 mPa*s or so will be more challenging to degas and pour - and venturing past 4,000 mPa*s should be done at own risk. The parameter is not critical, but it's good to avoid extremes. Pot life and demold time: many polyurethanes will have fairly short pot life, between 30 seconds and 4 minutes. That's usually not enough for manual casting, unless you are doing something very simple. Around 7-8 minutes is highly advisable for low viscosity resins, and closer to 10-15 minutes makes sense for when dealing with resins over 1,500 mPa*s or so. As for demold time, it is usually preferable to keep it short; between 2 and 6 hours is ideal, as it lets you crank out multiple batches in a single day. That said, overnight cure (12-24 hours) is not the end of the world. Any slow-curing resin can be accelerated in a simple way, and we'll cover that a few sections down. Presence of fillers: some resins are pre-mixed with fillers to improve their flexural properties, abrasion resistance, or fire rating. In general, don't go there unless you are sure that you can't approximate this effect by manually adding the appropriate filler, and that you want to be permanently stuck with all the drawbacks (e.g., higher viscosity, lower impact strength, and the tendency for fillers to settle in storage). Color: avoid dyed or non-pigmentable resins. Transparent, translucent, neutral white, and slightly off-white resins (light beige, lightly straw-colored, etc) can be usually easily pigmented to your liking. Colors such as amber, caramel, or tan are more of a gamble; ask for a photo or a sample of the material to determine how bad it really is. Some of these colors are faint and easily overcome, and some are there to stay. Compatibility with platinum-cure silicones: there is a small number of transparent resins or other specialty formulations may be inhibited by the platinum catalyst present in silicone molds. Always scan the datasheet for any mentions of that risk. If it's not mentioned, you are good to go. All right, ready for some recommendations? Here we go: Best all-around resin: Innovative Polymers IE-3075. Really, nothing else comes close. Translucent, high-strength plastic with a reasonable pot life (8 minutes) and quick demold time (2-3 hours for smaller parts). Around 83 Shore D, flex strength 120 MPa, modulus 2.9 GPa, decent impact resistance. Very low cost - around $17 per liter. The system can be slowed down in a simple way if you need a longer cure time or lower exotherm. A good fallback option in the US and several other markets is BJB Enterprises TC-854 A/B, which is about 15% less rigid and cures a tad faster, but is otherwise indistinguishable from IE-3075 and costs about the same. The other US choice is Huntsman RenCast 6591, but it has noticably shorter pot life, is harder to pigment, and costs much more. For those of you in Europe, RenCast 5146 (also sold as RenPIM 5219) is a very similar, low-cost resin. This one has a pot life of around 30 minutes, and requires overnight cure (unless you add some extra catalyst). There are some distributors for BJB products in the EU, too, so you may also have luck with TC-854 A/B. Water clear: Innovative Polymers OC-5274 or OC-5086. Like other mercury-free compositions, these are sensitive to moisture in thin layers. When making small castings in single-part molds, you may end up getting relatively low yields unless you preheat the mold, perform pressure casting, or add a small amount of a separately purchased catalyst (see section 4.4.4). The price of the resins is relatively steep, around $45 per liter. High-impact plastic: Innovative Polymers TP-4052. This product is fairly similar to IE-3075 in most aspects. Flexural parameters are somewhat worse, but impact strength is almost three times higher. Price is in the vicinity of $30 per liter. Note that as opposed to IE-3075, I have not found a way to slow this system down when low shrinkage in mass casting is desired. At this point, unless you have a specific itch to scratch, it's perfectly OK to order just IE-3075 directly from IPI. Their "1 gallon kit" (actually around 6.5 l) sells for about $110. "Quart kits" are also available if you need to try it out first. If you want to shop around, I don't think it makes sense to look beyond Innovative Polymers - not if you're in the States; they have a remarkable selection of unique, user-friendly products designed specifically for manual casting, and great customer service. They take direct orders, and also have several local distributors. If you're skeptical, you can have a look at products from Smooth-On, Alumilite, BJB Enterprises, or Freeman - but you will not find anything that even comes close to that selection. If you are in Europe, checking out Huntsman and Axson is not a bad plan. As with silicones, polyurethane resins are pretty stable and have a fairly long shelf life - but they are fairly sensitive to sunlight, humidity, heat, oxygen, and moisture. It is a good practice to buy several 100-250 ml polypropylene or HDPE bottles (example) for intermediate storage of the amounts of resin you plan to use within a month or so - and keep the original containers sealed and blanketed with inert gas. The inert gas can be just a burst of "canned air" (difluoroethane or tetrafluoroethane), but if you want to save money in the long haul and have some room in your workshop, it makes more sense to invest around $150 in a small nitrogen tank, a regulator, and a hose. This setup will last for months, and it's only about $10 to refill at a nearby Praxair location or so. In any case, if you store the resins properly, you can expect most of them to maintain their properties for at least 2-3 years; manufacturers usually give much more conservative guarantees, but take them with a grain of salt. Remember to agitate the containers if the components separate. Oh, some formulations may crystallize if kept below 10° C or so, but this process can be reversed easily. Prolonged storage in crystallized form is not advisable, as it may lead to the formation of insoluble dimers. Caution: although most of the polyurethane formulations you will encounter are reasonably safe, there are some unfortunate exceptions. We'll talk about this a bit more in chapter 7 - but for now, definitely watch out for: Volatile isocyanates: all isocyanates are dangerous if inhaled, but most of the prototyping formulations use prepolymers or monomers with negligible evaporation rates - so it would take serious effort to put yourself at risk (intentionally aerosolizing the resin would be one bad idea). In particular, MDI, HMDI / DMDI, and IPDI isocyanates are pretty safe. That said, some industrial resins use more volatile and more reactive compounds, such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) - and these are best avoided. Toxic catalysts: minutiae amounts of harmful organomercury salts, such as phenylmercuric neodecanoate, were found to be excellent, highly selective catalysts for polyurethanes; less concerning but still somewhat nasty tin(IV) compounds (e.g., dibutyltin dilaurate) offered some hard-to-replicate benefits, too. Needless to say, you probably want to avoid unnecessary risks. Such catalysts are largely phased out in favor of compounds of zinc, bismuth, tin(II), titanium, aluminum, and so on - but you can occasionally find them in products available in some markets (for example, Smooth-On, BJB, Alumilite, and Freeman still use them frequently). Possibly harmful amines: several amine curatives once-popular in certain high-performance elastomers - most notably 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA / MOCA) - were implicated as probably carcinogenic in humans. Be watchful for products that haven't switched to safer, modern alternatives. You won't find any of the problematic components in resins from Innovative Polymers - but other manufacturers sometimes show less restraint. Request and study material safety datasheets (MSDS) when in doubt. 4.1.4. Flexible polyurethanes Flexible polyurethane elastomers are an interesting alternative to silicones. You don't necessarily need to buy any, but they may come handy if you wish to make functional rubber parts, and your silicone is not pigmentable, or has insufficient strength. Key advantages of these rubbers include 30-50% lower price, and much better performance toward the upper end of Shore A (above 40 or so): several times higher tear strength, much less pronounced tear propagation, excellent abrasion resistance, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, lower viscosity, and the ability to pigment the system as seen fit. On the flip side, polyurethanes exhibit some exotherm-caused shrinkage in larger castings, and adhere to many other plastics, making them less desirable for creating negative molds; they also tend to have slightly worse rebound characteristics, and limited temperature resistance (they get soft around 70-90° C, and deteriorate somewhere between 150 and 200° C - so casting low-melt metals, for example, is out of question). The parameters to look for in these compositions are similar to these for silicones, with the exception of pot life and viscosity - here, the advice provided for polyurethanes is more pertinent. When reviewing the datasheets, pay close attention to the ratio of tensile strength to elongation at break, because there can be striking differences in the rigidity of various products, especially those rated 70 Shore A or above; some of them are only somewhat flexible, and will not be suitable for making parts such as tires, rollers, or transmission belts. Note: This goes both ways: not all Shore A polyurethanes are particularly rubbery, and not all Shore D polyurethanes are necessarily very rigid. For example, some 60 Shore D polymers are highly elastic and can be stretched up to three times their original length, even though their surface feels hard as nails. They resemble the rubbers used in certain garden hoses, shopping cart wheels, etc. As for recommendations: you should go with Innovative Polymers HP-21xx series; I've tried quite a few other products, and nothing else comes close. They are relatively inexpensive ($25 per liter) and feature superb "true rubber" mechanical characteristics, long pot life, and good cure profiles. For example, HP-2170A is a super-stretchy 70 Shore A rubber with tear strength of 42 kN/m, far surpassing most silicones. There are also softer variants, down to 50 Shore A (HP-2150A); and more rigid but still surprisingly flexible ones, up to around 60 Shore D (HP-2160D). In fact, it's possible to blend them to achieve intermediate properties as needed for a particular project. All the products in the HP-21xx line take several days to polymerize at room temperature; if that's too slow and heating them up is not an option, you can add some separately purchased catalyst to get overnight cure with no real trade-offs. 4.1.5. Epoxies, polyesters, and so on If you have dabbled in resin casting before, chances are, you used epoxy or styrene-based polyester resins, rather than polyurethanes. These options are popular with hobbyists because of their broad availability, low price, and less onerous processing requirements (i.e., less sensitivity to mixing ratios, moisture contamination, etc). That said, I think it's a bad idea to use these materials in precision casting work, for a couple of reasons: High shrinkage. Both polyesters and epoxies cure by condensation, and usually exhibit very high exotherm compared to polyurethanes with the same demold time. Shrinkage as high as 10% is common in unfilled polyesters; epoxies are better, but not dramatically so. Mold damage. Epoxies and polyesters use corrossive, oxidizing, or permeating components, and this reduces the service life of silicone molds quite a bit. It may be difficult to get 5-10 pulls out of a complex mold. Brittleness. Most epoxies and polyesters are designed to be cheap and to bond well, and not to have outstanding flexural parameters or impact strength. When superior characteristics are required, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or aramid cloth is typically used for reinforcement, but that's not very feasible for tiny, complex parts. Low UV resistance and clarity. Transparent epoxies and polyesters usually have lower clarity than water-clear polyurethanes, and are more prone to developing a yellow hue when exposed to sunlight. In comparison, many polyurethanes exhibit high UV stability. Workshop safety concerns. Components of a polyester resin are extremely volatile, flammable, and are an inhalation risk. Epoxies are more user-friendly, but use corrossive chemicals, and contain non-trivial amounts of bisphenol A. Bisphenol A hasn't been conclusively implicated in being harmful to humans, but is suspected of being an endocrine disruptor based on some subset of animal studies. Limiting your non-essential exposure may be a wise step. Of course, I don't want to demonize these polymers. Polyesters are sometimes useful for bonding and repair applications; and epoxies are extremely useful as high-performance glues and laminating or potting resins. Both epoxies and polyesters can be superior in lay-up composite applications, too, in part owing to their improved bonding capabilities. You can have a look at the products sold by Freeman Supply, or check out the low-cost, water-clear epoxies available from Polymer Composites Inc; just don't expect them to be a sensible match for PU for the processes discussed in this guide. 4.1.6. Pigments and dyes Adding colors to your castings is fairly easy. One option is to find an artist store, and shop for dry, non-toxic organic pigments. Such pigments will work equally well with polyurethanes, silicones, and just about anything else - but may be relatively painful to disperse or to blend with any accuracy. The other choice is to purchase coloring pastes where pigments are already dispersed in a non-reactive (plasticizer) or reactive (polyol) medium - but these won't work in silicones. For dry pigments, Kremer is probably the best source online. For reactive dispersions, you can ping Innovative Polymers (send them your picks from this RAL chart); Eager Plastics has a pretty good selection of non-reactive pigments and dyes, too. Beyond that... selecting your palette is a matter of personal preferences, but here are some quick tips: Be sure to get some titanium-based white (Kremer 46200, IPI Bright White) and deep black (Kremer 47400, IPI Black 201). These two are used not only as standalone pigments, but are also useful as opacifiers for controlling transparency of the material, and the saturation produced by other dyes. When browsing artist stores, try to avoid most mineral-, plant-, and animal-based pigments; stick to modern synthetic dyes where possible. In particular, be wary of traditional products containing lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel. It's easy to go from vivid hues to muted ones, but not the other way round. Focus on punchy pigments with simple names; "Bohemian moonlight blue" is not what you need. You can't just buy three primary colors, and hope to make every other hue with that. It won't work, especially if you are aiming for a vibrant pallette. Aim to get at least 6-8 different, useful colors to begin with. Whatever you do, keep your pigments moisture-free. Store them in closed containers and in a dry place. If you need inspiration, here are some nice picks: Daylight fluorescent colors: Kremer has a line of day-glo pigments that result in extremely vivid colors that form translucent dispersions; Innovative Polymers carries a good selection, too. Basic opaque pigments: in addition to black and white, you may want to start with vibrant yellow (Kremer 55100, IPI Yellow 802), cyan (Kremer 55500, IPI Blue 303), pure red (Kremer 55300, IPI Bright Red), magenta (Kremer 55470, IPI Magenta), green (Kremer 55700, IPI Signal green), orange (Kremer 55200, IPI Orange 602). Transparent dyes: useful only if you are planning to make transparent or translucent parts. ORASOL dyes produce brilliant transparent colors, but pre-made dispersions from Eager Plastics are more convenient to use and have very high yields. Fancy pearlescent pigments: check out Paint With Pearl. Their prices are hard to beat. A small bag or bottle of a pigment will cost somewhere between $5 and $20, and should last for years. Tip: You can, of course, opt to paint your parts instead of adding pigments to the resin; acrylic and polyurethane lacquers can be used alike. For adding text or other ornamental elements to machined parts, you may also want to consider a low-cost vinyl cutter, such as Silhouette SD or Roland Stika SV-8. These devices are fairly affordable, and the results look amazingly good - especially if a layer of clear coat is applied on top. If another cutting machine is too much, you can also simply equip your CNC mill with a specialized drag knife to get comparable results. 4.1.7. Other additives Adding colors aside, many other properties of cured plastics can be altered in profound ways by introducing certain easily available, low-cost additives. It's almost impossible to provide an exhaustive overview of all the available choices, but several use cases are definitely worth calling out: If you want to reduce shrinkage, there are many fillers that increase the distance between reactive molecules of the resin, slowing down the reaction and buffering some of the produced heat - but the ones that do so without significantly affecting viscosity or mechanical properties of the finished part are of particular interest. I found that 3M Scotchlite iM30K, a type of high-strength, hollow glass microspheres (less than 0.02 mm in diameter) works great when added at a ratio of about 4% by weight; when used in conjunction with the pre-mixing trick discussed earlier on, shrinkage is eliminated almost completely. When flexural properties are of utmost importance, tiny milled glass fibers, around 0.8 mm long, significantly reduce shrinkage at a radio between 10 and 30% by weight. Both of these fillers sell for less than $20 per liter. When you need to reduce weight, Scotchlite S15 can be added to any system at ratios as high as 3:1 by volume, resulting in a free-flowing resin with effective density less than 0.4 g/cm³. Compressive strength will be pretty reasonable, but flexural properties will suffer. This may come handy especially for hulls of model airplanes or boats. When you want an extremely hard plastic, the aforementioned variety of short glass fibers can substantially improve flexural strength, more than double flexural modulus, and significantly increase hardness and abrasion resistance - especially when used in conjunction with a silane coupling agent (see later on). Using longer or thicker fibers is a possibility, but may affect surface finish or complicate the casting process. For short fibers, ratios around 30% by weight are a good starting point. The downside of this trick is a significant reduction in impact strength; starting with a high-impact resin, such as TP-4052, may give you a bit more wiggle room. For improved impact strength, lower hardness, or lower viscosity, plasticizers can be introduced to the system to effectively add "padding" in the resulting polymer structure. Because they don't participate in the polymerization reaction, they reduce tensile strength and may increase creep (the tendency for the material to permanently deform under relatively minor but sustained load), but that trade-off is acceptable in many uses. For polyurethanes, one of the safer and more versatile plasticizers is dipropylene glycol dibenzoate (DPGDB), available from Eager Plastics under the name of EP9009. For silicones, any low-viscosity silicone oil will do; you can get it from the same source that you are purchasing the resin from. Plasticizer levels between 5 and 10% are common, although in silicone rubbers, up to 50% may be useful. You shouldn't have to pay more than $20-$40 per liter or so. To simulate select properties of metals: powdered metals, such as copper, aluminum, or iron, can be added to resins in significant amounts to increase their weight, thermal conductivity, and remarkably, give them a highly metallic appearance and feel when polished. You can find suitable 300-600 mesh metal powders on eBay or from sources such as ArtMolds. Prices vary, but aren't prohibitive. Flexural properties will suffer. Of course, multiple types of fillers can be combined; in particular, it may be useful to add some glass fibers to lightweight materials filled with hollow glass spheres, to maintain acceptable flexural strength. If you are wondering what to buy up front, it's not a completely bad plan to get some Scotchlite iM30K, plus 0.8 mm glass fibers, and a bit of DPGDB (also useful for preparing pigment dispersions and such). Other fillers are not nearly as essential. 4.2. Casting workshop Now that we have the selection of resins, pigments, and fillers sorted out, it's time to briefly chat about the workshop equipment you will need to get the ball rolling. The list isn't particularly long, but even when it comes to something as inconsequential as mixing cups, making the wrong choice will unnecessarily complicate your life. 4.2.1. Vacuum pump and chamber Insufficient mixing may cause a range of problems with finished parts - but vigorous stirring will almost always introduce some air into the resin. This problem aside, bubbles of air may get trapped inside mold crevices as you pour the mixture in - even if your mixing skills are beyond reproach. Last but not least, some resins may simply liberate some amount of dissolved gases once the polymerization reaction begins; IE-3075 is an example of that. Vacuum degassing solves all these problems, and is not as scary as it may sound. Even if you are on a tight budget, you should get a low-cost vacuum pump capable of getting pulling around -1000 mbar of vacuum (that's about 10 mbar absolute, or -29.5 inches of mercury). I ordered mine from VIOT: click here for an entry-level model that sells for around $100, and should work fine; I have a $140 model with a higher flow rate, and it served me well. You will also need some sort of a vacuum chamber to hold the mixing container and the mold itself; it's possible to rig something together on your own, for example using a sturdy cooking pot and a cover made out of thick polycarbonate - but low-cost vacuum dessicator chambers work fine in that capacity, and start around $50 or so. If you are planning to work on relatively small projects, or opted for a pump with a relatiely low flow rate, Bel-Art #420100000 is a good choice; otherwise, model #420430000 will accommodate larger pieces, too. (For a bit more money, you can also find some good-looking purpose-built degassing chambers from several sellers on eBay.) About the only other piece of this puzzle is a hose to connect the pump with the chamber. I use 1/4" Kuriyama K7160 Polyspring, which I ordered from these guys; it's about $4 per meter. Other hoses can be used, too, but they need to be vacuum-rated, which in practice means that they need to be either fairly rigid, or reinforced with a metal spring to avoid collapsing as soon as you turn the pump on. Beyond that... well, getting some vacuum grease for o-rings and other parts of the vacuum chamber is not a bad plan (link); it also comes handy for several other purposes every now and then - for example, for preventing caps on resin bottles from seizing in storage. 4.2.2. Auxiliary tools It goes without saying that for any sort of precision work, you need a reasonably well-equipped workshop to begin with. I am assuming that you already have that - and that basic tools such as clamps, needle files, or several grades of fine sanding paper, are always within reach. With that in mind, there are several less obvious, minor items that will be useful specifically when casting mechanical parts, and that we haven't mentioned before: Precision scale: observing proper mix ratios is extremely important for addition cure silicones - errors of as little as 2% may affect important properties of the rubber. Polyurethanes are a bit more tolerant, but it is important to stay within 4% or so. To that effect, in order to accurately mix components when working with relatively small quantities of resins (10-50 ml), you should try to get a scale with a resolution of at least 0.05 g, and measurement range of at least 0-200 g. You can get something usable for under $40 (I ordered from wholesale-scales.com, and can't complain). If you are watching your budget, you can also get away with a regular, gram-resolution kitchen scale - but in this case, you shouldn't attempt to mix less than about 30 ml of polyurethane, or 100 ml of silicone. In the long haul, this may be wasteful, depending on the size of your parts. Mixing containers: any plastic cup should do, but consider getting a box of one hundred 100 ml polypropylene beakers from Ted Pella or any other outlet with lab supplies; the price should be around 20 cents a piece ($20 per box). PP beakers are nearly indestructible, will not crack during mixing, will not melt when heated up, and will not fall apart when exposed to solvents. But perhaps most importantly, resins don't stick to them, so you can reuse the same cup over and over again. This actually leads to savings after a month or two of casting work! Mixing sticks: you can mix the resin with just about anything, as long as it's dry, clean, and has the right shape to reach all the spots inside the mixing cup. Many people use tongue depressors, which cost something around 1-2 cents a piece (try Ted Pella), and can be wiped clean and reused indefinitely. If you choose that option, just keep them away from moisture, and be sure to clip the business end to get a flat tip for better reach. Tongue depressors aside, chopsticks also work well, as do proper laboratory spatulas and flattened mixing sticks (link). The choice is yours. Freezer paper or thick aluminum foil: it's convenient to pour a bit extra resin into the mold, and let it overflow before sealing everything; this minimizes the risk of air entrapment. Any non-permeable, cheap material can be used to protect the surrounding working area against the overflowing resin; freezer paper and heavy-duty aluminum foil from a grocery store will do the trick. Deburring tools: there are several inexpensive hand tools that prove very useful for quickly cleaning up the thin film of resin that may be present around the mold's parting line, and for fixing other minor casting artifacts. I recommend grabbing one miniature swivel deburrer, such as Noga RB1000 ($8); one fixed-blade scraper, such as Noga SC8000 ($20); and perhaps a couple of small, hard Nylon brushes, such as this kit (already mentioned before). You can do without them, and just use a toothbrush, a pin, and a needle file - but your life will be a bit more difficult. Dental picks / wax carvers: a low-cost set of picks, hooks, and spatulas - something like this kit ($9) - will be extremely useful for removing silicone molds from masters, and for assorted other precision work. In fact, if you don't have that in your workshop already, you are missing out. Sheet polypropylene or HDPE: flat, smooth, non-stick plastics are useful for covering single-part molds to ensure dimensionally accurate and aesthetic castings. Polypropylene is the best choice, and you can get it in cut-to-size pieces from many sources, including Professional Plastics; HDPE is a second option, but it is less temperature-resistant, and it's more common to see warped sheets. In any case, get at least 15-20 cut-to-size pieces, around 1-3 mm thick, with dimensions corresponding to the scale of parts you are expecting to routinely make (10 x 15 cm is probably a good starting point). You can get individual larger pieces later on. Note: make sure that the material you are buying is machined to a flat, smooth surface; HDPE in particular is sometimes available in patterned varieties - suitable for making cutting boards, but not so much for casting work. The material may come with some minor scratches, but these can be buffed out easily with fine sanding paper. If the pieces are badly gouged or warped, however, request a replacement! Brushes: a set of small, soft-bristled brushes (example) will be useful for cleaning master patterns and applying mold releases and other treatments to molds. That's about it! For working with small quantities of resin and pouring it into complex multi-part molds, you may also find it useful to get a box of single-use, two-element 10 ml syringes with no rubber seals (e.g., from eNasco), and some blunt-tip dispensing needles. 4.2.3. Mold releases and other useful chemicals Mold release is a material that forms a protective barrier between the mold and the resin you will be pouring in, and makes it easier to demold final parts. The use of mold releases is optional when casting silicones in polyurethane patterns, or polyurethanes in silicone molds, because these materials don't adhere to each other in a particularly strong way - but still, a properly selected release agent makes demolding easier, and prolongs the life of any mold by reducing its exposure to reactive chemicals. On top of that, if you ever want to cast polyurethanes in polyurethane molds, or silicones in silicone molds, a robust adhesion barrier is simply a must. I have tried many different mold releases over the years, and my top pick is, unquestionably, Stoner A324; this spray-on agent beats most of the silicone, PTFE, or zinc stearate releases that I have tried before. They sell it for about $5 per can, and this should last you for about 1-3 months of hobby work. Stoner ships for free if you order a full box of 12 cans ($60). If you can't obtain this product in your market, silicone-based mold releases are your second best choice, although some varieties may gradually permeate and swell silicone molds. Releases based on mineral oils, PTFE, zinc stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, and so on, usually don't perform well in high-precision, vacuum-assisted casting work. The manufacturer of your silicone rubbers may be able to recommend some specific, locally available picks. That aside, you may want to also grab a wax-based mold release: they dry to form a hard, polishable, permanent layer that not only serves as a barrier, but should improve the surface aspect of polyurethane patterns. Low-viscosity brush-on formulations, such as Synlube 531, should work well; more viscous liquids, such as AdTech MR-1, may need to be diluted with naphtha when working with intricate shapes, but it's not a hard thing to do. Hardware store paste waxes that contain carnauba wax (link) work fine for simple shapes where dimensional accuracy is not critical, but high-gloss finish is desired - and if you dilute them to a water-like consistency, you can use them for complex models, too. In all cases, once the wax is dry, you can simply buff it with a soft cloth or a brush. Note: waxes should not be applied to silicone molds, because they will inevitably crack and peel off - and the solvents used are usually damaging to silicone rubbers, too. In general, with any new mold release, always test it by soaking a piece of silicone in it for about 5-10 minutes; any substantial or permanent change in dimensions would be a reason for concern. Mold releases aside, you may find it useful to get some of the following, largely optional chemicals: Basic solvents: it's good to have the following two options at hand: Acetone: when used sparingly, works as a great degreaser for plastics; if you don't make a habit of using it, you will not get robust bonds with cyanoacrylate or epoxy glues, especially on molded parts that may be still covered with release agents or so. It is also useful as a solvent for certain resin additives, and helps degas stubborn or high-viscosity resins (1-2 drops make a huge difference). It is advisable to get reagent-grade acetone from eBay (link); hardware-store variety is usually also OK, but may cause problems if it contains too much water. VM&P naphtha: useful for diluting mold releases and for cleaning up silicone spills. Ethyl acetate (an acetone-like solvent used in nail polish) works for the last two purposes, too - and may be a more environmentally friendly alternative. Siloxane surfactants (very optional): concentrated siloxane surfactants make it easier to use polyurethane resins as surface coatings; they do that improving wetting characteristics and eliminating pinhole defects. You will likely need them if you wish to use resins such as HP-21xx or IE-3075 as high-performance surface coats. Look for a product called Satur~8 on eBay; when added to resin at around 1.5%, it should make quite a difference. Silane couplers (ditto): these may come handy if you wish to add glass-based fillers to polyurethane resins, or improve bonding to glass surfaces. They modify the surface of these materials to make them form strong, covalent bonds with polyurethanes, epoxies, and similar plastics. The coupler is applied as a 2% solution in alcohol or acetone, and then left to dry in the presence of atmospheric moisture (water molecules are needed for the actual activation process to occur). The most common and useful compounds are called 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO) and (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTES). Concentrated variants can be ordered from Chemsavers.com (just drop them a mail), or get a smaller quantity from SPI Supplies (link for GLYMO, link for APTES). Diluted APTES is also available from crafts stores. Note that you don't always have to go through all this trouble; for example, milled glass fibers available from Fibreglast are already pre-treated in this manner, and there is no point in soaking them in a coupling agent again. On the other hand, Scotchlite glass microspheres come in a virgin state and will benefit from this step. 4.2.4. Optional: temperature-controlled oven Temperature-controlled ovens are not essential in casting work, but they let you perform several time-saving tasks: Drying molds, pigments, fillers, and other supplements if necessary. In most cases, this can be also accomplished with any cheap, $40 toaster oven. Accelerating the cure of resins when dimensional accuracy is not critical. This is sometimes preferred to chemical acceleration, because there is no need to purchase any reagents, and the behavior can be fine-tuned more easily. Thermal acceleration requires accurate temperature control between around 30-70° C, and will usually let you demold parts in under 1 hour. Post-curing finished parts, so that they achieve their ultimate properties sooner than normal (it may take up to a week at room temperature for all the reactions to cease). This requires accurate temperature control around 80-120° C. Low-cost toaster ovens are the obvious solution, but somewhat unfortunately, they have extremely poor temperature accuracy and stability, especially on the lower end of the scale. If you are an accomplished DIYer, you may be able to grab one and simply equip it with a more accurate, digital temperature control circuit. That said, if you are willing to part with a few hundred bucks and have some floor space, you can also try getting a real laboratory oven, such as this one ($400); hot air sterilizers and dryers may offer a smaller and slightly more affordable alternatives in some markets, too (example, around $300). If you don't have that much money, or simply don't have enough room, don't worry; you can do just fine without this piece of equipment, provided you are willing to wait a bit longer for your castings every now and then. 4.2.5. Optional: pressure pot There are some complex, multi-part molds where it may be hard to consistently avoid air entrapment, even with the aid of vacuum; on top of that, there are some resins that tend to be difficult to fully degas, or that will develop bubbles of carbon dioxide when not mixed perfectly well, or when exposed to residual humidity. That latter set of problems is particularly evident in mercury-free water clear poulyrethanes, such as the vanilla version of Innovative Polymers OC-5086. To improve your odds when dealing with such tricky cases, it helps to have a pressure pot; the idea is to increase ambient pressure surrounding the mold to about 3-4 bar, thus crushing and dissolving back any existing bubbles, and discouraging the formation of new ones. Sure, it's a brute-force solution - but can you argue with its results? Pressure casting equipment is more bulky, more expensive, and somewhat more dangerous than vacuum pumps (due to much higher pressure differentials) - and for most part, isn't necessary; get it only if you have plenty of room, and you are either forced to work with water clear resins that don't tolerate non-pressurized casting, or you are willing to spend at least $200 to improve your yields a tiny bit (say, from 85% to 97%). If you want to take this route, pressure pots start around $80 (link); nicer ones fetch as much as $300 (link). To operate it, you will also need a compressor - and these start from $100 from fairly noisy units from the hardware store, to $180 for relatively quiet-running ones; standard pressure hoses and fittings add another $20 or so. 4.3. Your first casting projects All right, all right - enough with all the theory and shopping tips. It's time to dig out that wax pattern that you have made before, and turn it into a finished work of art! This section is all-text, but if you need visual aids, this photolog is probably good to look at. Caution: similarly to many workshop and household chemicals, casting resins can be harmful if misused. In particular, they may react violently when mixed with incompatible substances; cause severe irritation or lasting damage if splashed into your eyes; and will emit dangerous vapors if overheated, burned, or intentionally aerosolized. Please refer to product safety datasheets (MSDSes), and to section 7 of this guide, for an overview of known risks, material handling recommendations, and disposal procedures. Do not proceed with any hands-on experiments until you have done so. 4.3.1. Making a silicone mold Resin casting is fun, but you need to remember that once the components are mixed, the reaction will proceed no matter what; it's important to plan accordingly: read this section fully and memorize all the steps beforehand, and have all the necessary supplies and information within reach. First, you need to estimate the amount of resin you will need: for CNC-machined or 3D-printed shapes, simply ask your CAD application to calculate the volume of the master, and subtract this value from the volume of a dummy box of the same height, width, and depth. To have a comfortable margin, add about 15% to the result, or 10 ml, whichever is greater. Then, multiply that volume by the density of the resin (check the datasheet; it's usually between 1.1 and 1.4 g/cm³). The resulting figure is the weight of the material you need to prepare. With these calculations out of the way, prepare the following stuff: A roll of paper towels. Tear away about 5-10 pieces ahead of time, and place them within reach; this comes handy for wiping mixing tools, cleaning up minor spills, etc. An easily accessible trash bag for dirty towels and other things you want to get rid of in a hurry. Mixing container that fits within your degassing chamber, and holds at least 3 times the volume of resin you will be working with. A clean, flat, and clutter-free work surface, covered with aluminum foil or freezer paper. A kitchen timer, a stopwatch, or something else that would let you keep track of time. Although accidents are unlikely, you should still try to minimize potential damage: if there are any LCDs or other expensive gizmos in your workshop, consider moving them a bit farther away, or covering them with plastic sheeting. Don't wear your best clothes, and if you have a carpeted floor or expensive hardwood, cover the area that is most likely to suffer in case of a spill. When you are ready to go, place the mixing cup on a scale, then tare it. Agitate both components of the resin in their original containers, and then use a clean tongue depressor or a spoon to pour about 20 g of silicone into the mixing cup. Add a suitable amount of catalyst (the ratio is usually 10:1, but check the datasheet), start the timer, and begin mixing thoroughly for honest 3 minutes; be sure to repeatedly scrape the sides and the bottom to avoid leaving any unmixed resin in these spots. Next, place the cup under vacuum; the mix will initially rise as the bubbles expand, and then collapse back; you should keep it under vacuum for another 1-2 minutes past that point. If the resin gets dangerously close to overflowing during the initial rise, simply release the vacuum (i.e., yank out the hose), and try again; several cycles of that should do the trick - and next time, use a larger cup. The next step is to pour some of the resin into the mold created in chapter 3; use about half of the required volume or so. Place the mold on a strip of aluminum foil, and put that under vacuum; this will help the resin conform to even the most intricate shapes with no effort on your end. After about 2-3 minutes, you can slowly release the vacuum, pour the remaining amount of resin (use a bit more than necessary to get a convex surface at the top of the mold), and set the whole thing aside for several minutes to allow any bubbles to rise to the surface (or collapse back into the resin). If there are any stubborn bubbles on the surface at that point, you can apply a gentle burst of compressed air to get rid of them. Finally, cover the entire contraption with a flat, clean sheet of polypropylene; lay it down gradually, starting at one side, to avoid air entrapment. When done, weigh it down with something reasonably heavy - around 500 g should do - and brace the whole thing, so that the cover doesn't slide off. Be sure to check the timer at this point - has the entire process taken more than about 12-15 minutes? If yes, why? In any case, give it about 12 hours or so, until the resin remaining in the mixing cup is firm and tack-free. If you are impatient, placing the mold in a temperature-controlled oven at around 50° C will cut the curing time down to 1-2 hours or so - but don't go too high, given that this particular master is made out of wax. When the rubber is ready to demold, pull off the cover, and then use a dental hook or a similar tool to pry the rubber off near the corner of the mold. Remove it fully and inspect the result. if it looks flawless - as it should - you may want to briefly post-cure it at around 100° C for 30-60 minutes, and in the meantime, pat yourself on the back! Here are several questions that may be on your mind: What about the application of a mold release? Waxes already have a non-stick surface, so if you are following the instructions from chapter 3, you should be fine. When using prototyping boards or 3D-printed materials, you should apply a thin layer of mold release beforehand, and allow it to dry. Use a soft brush to spread the substance evenly, and don't overdo it: you want to wet the workpiece, but do not let the liquid pool in hard-to-reach spots. The resin didn't cure! What now? Ow, bummer. The most likely reason is insufficient mixing (especially if there are sticky patches or streaks in an otherwise well-cured material); bad mixing proportions; contact with incompatible materials (platinum-cure silicones are particularly sensitive to sulfur compounds); or low temperature (the resin will take forever to cure below 18° C or so). If you have ruled these causes out, feel free to drop me a mail, and we'll try to get to the bottom of it. What if I'm having trouble demolding? This takes some practice - try to find the right tools, and locate a spot where you can grab the rubber with a hook without causing any damage. For particularly challenging shapes, introducing pull tabs and draft angles in the mold, as discussed earlier, is the way to go. What if the mold is too big to put under vacuum? For simple shapes, you can just gently pour the degassed rubber in, starting at the lowest point of the mold. If there are any tight spots, it's useful to fill a syringe with a small amount of catalyzed resin, put a needle on, and use that to force the resin into these problem areas beforehand. When working with truly oversize pieces, you may find it useful to rely on a process called glove molding: brush on several thin layers of silicone onto the part, and then coat this flexible skin with a rigid, thixotropic polyurethane, epoxy, or polyester resin to create a backing shell. This is a great way to conserve silicone, although the mold takes more time and effort to prepare. (For optimal results, the silicone resin used for this purpose may need to be thickened to a non-flowable consistency with an additive such as Bluestar 22646 or with fumed silica. Fumed silica can be also used as a thickener for the rigid resin used as the outer coat.) Vacuum degassing only made the bubbles worse, what now?! The resin should rise and collapse pretty quickly; some bubbles will continue to appear, but they should collapse back shortly after the system is returned to room pressure. If that doesn't happen, check the ballast valve on your pump (it should be closed) and examine the entire setup for any leaks. Make sure that the pump is in good working order (many pumps require the right amount and type of mineral oil for lubrication). Verify that the pump is well-suited for the size of your vacuum chamber, too. If you're stumped, getting a cheap vacuum gauge from Amazon may help. How long will the mold last? Depends. When following the advice provided in this guide, around 50 pulls would be the norm. Lower-strength silicones, more aggressive resins (epoxies, polyesters, very fast or very slow polyurethanes), and complex geometries (deep molds with intricate detail) will lower the lifespan of silicone molds. Okay, okay - time for some polyurethane fun! 4.3.2. Casting plastic parts Polyurethane casting is not dramatically different from working with silicones, but you have to be swift, and pay more attention to detail. Quite simply, with a resin such as IE-3075 or TP-4052, you will probably only have about 6 minutes to go through all the steps - so there is no time to look around for paper towels or a mixing stick. In general, before starting, you should go through all the preparation steps outlined in the previous section; and when done, you should also do the following: Make sure that the resin hasn't separated or crystallized. In almost all formulations, the isocyanate component should be clear, and both components should be completely homogenous. Agitate the containers if necessary; crystallization may require heating the containers slightly (usually not more than 40° C); always check with the manufacturer first, and exercise caution. Note: in filled systems, the filler settles out of the solution and hard-packs at the bottom of the container; this is particularly true for heavy fillers, such as glass. You need to use a small paint mixer attached to a power drill to properly homogenize the contents of larger containers; it's not a big deal, but watch out for spills. Manual mixing is viable only for small quantities, up to perhaps 250 ml or so. If you haven't done so already, get two smaller polypropylene bottles, and fill them up with a more manageable amount of isocyanate and polyol, so that you do not have to constantly agitate, open, and tip over gallon-size jugs. When done, blanket the original containers with "canned air" or nitrogen, and close then tightly. Be sure to label the new bottles clearly, too. Make sure that the mold and any hygroscopic fillers you want to add are perfectly dry - especially before first use, or after extended storage. Placing solid materials at 110-150° C for about 10-20 minutes, or applying vacuum for 5-10 minutes, is a good option if you want to play it very safe. Prepare a perfectly flat, spill-proof surface on which the silicone molds will be laid out while the resin cures. You can use a sheet of polypropylene, or a neat piece of aluminum foil with no creases. Whichever option you choose, applying some mold release to that surface is a good idea. Grab a small, flat sheet of polypropylene or HDPE to serve as a top cover for the mold. Mark one side with a permanent marker, apply a thin coat of mold release to the other, and place the sheet within reach. Apply a very light coat of mold release to the silicone mold, and spread it evenly with a brush. Repeat the process every 5-10 pulls, but don't overdo it; for casting polyurethanes in silicone molds, too little is better than too much. Allow the release to dry for 15 minutes or so. With all the preparations taken care of, you are ready to roll. Place the mixing cup on the scale, tare it, and pour the required amount of isocyanate; in our case, 10 g will do. Next, gently pour the appropriate amount of polyol (for IE-3075, this will be 8.9 g), start the timer, and begin mixing very thoroughly, frequently scraping the walls. Most polyurethane resins, IE-3075 included, require at least 90 seconds of mixing to progress from a dispersion to a proper solution when mixed in a small quantity - and if you stop sooner, the cured material may not cure properly. Do it right. When done, place the container under vacuum, and turn on the pump. The resin should take no more than about a minute to rise and collapse back; if it's taking much longer, your vacuum chamber may be too big, or the pump may be inadequate or malfunctioning (e.g., due to an open gas ballast valve, or due to contamination). If, on the other hand, everything went as expected - and the bubbles have collapsed in a timely manner - you should now pour some of the resin into the mold cavity (to fill it roughly halfway, taking care to cover any detail where air entrapment is likely), and place the mold under vacuum for another minute or so. Don't worry if it never stops bubbling at this stage; that's OK. After a brief round of degassing, release the vacuum gently, place the mold on a previously prepared flat surface, and add the remaining resin, until it overflows and forms a convex surface (this is important - otherwise, air entrapment is a lot harder to avoid). Grab the polypropylene cover and carefully lay it on top of the mold, using the technique outlined for silicones. You should brace the cover against something, so that it doesn't slide off, and weigh it down with around 200 g (larger molds can be clamped with several kg of force, but this particular one is relatively easy to squish). Well, that's it! Before you go, check the timer; if the process has taken more than six minutes, you should figure out how to improve it. In any case, leave the mold alone for at least 3 hours (or more, depending on the resin used), and when you come back, confirm that the material left over in the mixing cup is tack-free and hard as nails. Next, gently flex the polypropylene cover to detach it from the part, and extract your casting from the mold. Hopefully, the result is perfectly fine; that said, the likelihood of mishaps is higher for polyurethanes than it is for silicones - so if something isn't right, don't despair. Here's a quick summary of the most common issues I have seen: The resin is still sticky or gooey: assuming you waited long enough, the culprit may be low ambient temperature (try to stay close to 20-25° C), incorrect mixing proportions, or mixing the wrong components (the containers all look almost the same). A less likely cause may be the introduction of a problematic filler or dye, or the use of a resin that is incompatible with platinum cure silicones (this is rare; the datasheet should have said so). Treating the surface of the mold with a separately purchased polyurethane catalyst is a possible workaround for that last problem - see later on. The material turned into a foam: this may be caused by using a resin that crystallized during storage and hasn't been heated up to dissolve the crystals; by adding a filler or other additive that contained a significant amount of water; or by similar type of gross moisture contamination (wet hands, condensation, etc). In some formulations, failing to properly degas the catalyzed resin, mixing for way too short, or not allowing the mold release to dry properly before pour, may also cause a similar symptom. (If you suspect your vacuum setup, check out the tips in the previous section.) Top surface is soft and scratches easily: this is almost always due to insufficient mixing. Dispersed droplets of polyol have coalesced and, being lighter than the isocyanate component, floated up. More thorough mixing or higher ambient temperature will usually fix the issue. Premixing - as discussed later on - should also help. Discoloration or clusters of tiny bubbles running around edges or in other well-defined streaks: usually also a matter of insufficient mixing - see above. Several individual, round bubbles that floated to the top or are stuck in tight corners at the bottom of the mold: air entrapment during the casting process. If there are stubborn bubbles still present in the liquid as you are pouring it into the mold, and your vacuum system is in good working order otherwise - mix in 1-2 drops of acetone per 10 ml of resin before degassing, and see if that helps. Oh - when in-mold degassing is not possible due to the size of the part, applying the resin with a syringe or a brush may help with any tricky spots. Giant tear-shaped bubble near the top surface: air sucked into the mold due to applying too much force when placing the cover or insufficient clamping. It may also be that you haven't poured enough resin to begin with, or that the cover or your work surface is warped. Several oddball bubbles in thin sections, especially if suspended in the middle of the part: often caused by using a highly moisture-sensitive and slowly curing resin, such as OC-5086; the bubbles form as the resin is already partly-solid, contributing to their sometimes elongated or meandering shapes. If all other options fail, pre-heating the molds, adding some extra catalyst (see later), or using pressurized casting will help. If you are seeing any issues, it's important to narrow the problem down right away, while the number of variables is still fairly low. If you are out of ideas, don't hesitate to ping me at lcamtuf@coredump.cx; I may be able to help. A good place to discuss your experiences or showcase your work may be /r/resincasting, too! Anyway - if everything turned out to be just fine, you may want to briefly post-cure the part and any leftover material. Place it at around 100° C for one hour, and then play with it to get a sense of its physical properties: try drilling a hole in or scratching the surface of one of the leftover bits, and see how hard it is to break it. 4.4. Miscellaneous polyurethane casting tips This section is just a quick a collection of random notes that should come handy in real-life projects, but that I wanted to keep out of your first casting job. Enjoy! 4.4.1. Meta: not all resins are alike Before we dive into various advanced topics, you should know that there are significant differences in the handling characteristics of various polyurethane resins, even if the advertised cure times and ultimate physical properties of the material are roughly the same. In particular, be aware of the following: The choice of catalysts will affect the resin's sensitivity to moisture, often dramatically so. Some resins with highly selective catalysts will cure pretty well in open air, and can be used as surface coats (e.g., HP-21xx); some have moderate sensitivity that can be greatly lowered using the premixing technique outlined later in this chapter (IE-3075, TP-4052); and others, such as OC-5086, really need to be modified with an aftermarket catalyst, or pressure-cast, to maintain sanity when making precision parts. The use of blocked or temperature-sensitive catalysts helps achieve long pot life followed by a snap cure when casting larger models; unfortunately, the same trick may prolong demold time when working with tiny parts that never reach the activation threshold. The exact composition of the system will greatly affect miscibility of the formulation at lower temperatures, before the reaction really kicks in. Some resins will require very little stirring when working with quantities around 10-20 ml, but a few may need as much as 5 minutes of work, unless you are willing to increase the temperature slightly (to ~30° C) or employ a similar trick. Depending on the composition, the resin may have a brittle stage, at which point it is very vulnerable to cracking even under minimal stress; in other systems, incomplete polymerization is simply marked by susceptibility to plastic deformation. Because of all these striking differences, don't take everything you see in this guide as universally applicable to every formulation on the market; and in the same vein, don't expect your own experiences with product A to be fully applicable to product B. If in doubt, request a sample of any new product you are considering, or simply ask. 4.4.2. Adding pigments and fillers to resins Let's start with something simple. Non-reactive (i.e., plasticizer-based) liquid dyes and coloring pastes can be mixed into the working amount of isocyanate, before adding any polyol; when taking this route, just try to stay under 2% by volume (around 8-10 drops per 10 ml); if you find yourself routinely having to add more, consider switching to dry pigments or a higher-yield dye or a reactive carrier - because past this point, solvents used in the dye will be affecting the properties of the part. Reactive coloring pastes designed specifically for polyurethanes use a polyol as a base; that's the case for pigments from Innovative Polymers. Their main benefit that they can be added at much higher levels without completely messing up the properties of your parts. In principle, you should subtract the weight of the added dye from the required weight of polyol - but in practice, this varies from one formulation to another. In a quick experiment with IE-3075, I found that using the nominal amount of polyol results in improved strength. Results in other resins may vary. When working with dry pigments, there is a bit more legwork involved. If you simply dump the pigment unceremoniously into the liquid, it will probably clump together - and stay that way. To avoid this, you need to place the desired amount of material in an empty mixing cup, tare it, and start adding isocyanate drop by drop, mixing constantly, until you end up with a homogenous, runny paste (siloxane surfactants can make the process easier, too). Once the paste looks good, you can gradually add the remaining isocyanate while constantly mixing - and you should be all set. Tip: if you have a high-yield, hard-to-disperse powdered pigment that you keep coming back to, it may make sense to make a custom coloring paste for future use. Simply disperse it thoroughly in an inert plasticizer (e.g., dipropylene glycol dibenzoate, discussed earlier; silicone oil works for platinum cure rubbers) or in a suitable polyol, and pour that into a dropper bottle. Of course, as noted earlier, you should ensure that the material is moisture-free; in tricky cases, premixing the resin or adding zeolite should help. Glass-based fillers, such as Scotchlite or milled fibers, may benefit from being pre-treated with a silane coupler, too. 4.4.3. Premixing the system Premixing is one of the simplest and lesser known tricks that can help solve many of the problems that crop up in some polyurethane casting jobs. For example, it can dramatically reduce shrinkage without affecting cure time; lower the risk of cure inhibition; halve the time needed to fully mix the resin in small batches; and greatly reduce the sensitivity to moisture, to the point of making many systems suitable for surface coating applications. These benefits stem from the reduced reactivity and improved compatibility of a partly polymerized liquid. It's not a silver bullet, but for many formulations, it's pretty close to being one. The only price to pay for premixing is an increase in viscosity, which typically isn't a big deal if you have started with a low-viscosity system such as IE-3075; and the added expense of about 5 minutes of work and about one hour of waiting per every batch that you intend to cast. If you want to try it out, the recipe is very simple: measure the desired amount of isocyanate, add all the fillers and dyes you want to have, and then introduce between 10% and 20% of the necessary amount of polyol; this mix needs to be stirred thoroughly, degassed - and then stored in a covered cup, blanketed with an inert gas, for about 1-2 hours. At that point, the remaining polyol can be mixed in, and the resin can be cast. Keep in mind that premixed resins will have short shelf life: the viscosity will keep increasing, and in presence of a catalyst, the isocyanate will more aggressively react with ambient humidity and deteriorate. You should premix only the amount you intend to use right away. Oh - in case you are curious, this graph shows the impact of premixing on the exotherm for 10 g of IE-3075, and how it compares to the use of fillers. The measurements were taken using a thermocouple submerged in a small, insulated polypropylene cup, approx. 30 mm in diameter: The X axis is time in seconds. The Y axis is temperature in °C. The resin and the room are initially at around 20 °C. 4.4.4. Adjusting room-temperature cure speed of existing resins Here's another tidbit you won't find in any other hobbyist reference on resin casting: it is possible, and in fact fairly easy, to chemically slow down many polyurethane systems to significantly reduce shrinkage; and to accelerate slow-curing ones to get your parts sooner or have fewer artifacts in thin sections of your molds. Why bother, you may ask? Well, it not only saves you money, compared to buying several resins for different applications - but perhaps more interestingly, it enables you to come up with custom-tailored cure profiles that are of no commercial interest to the manufacturer. In essence, there is a wide variety of catalysts used in castable polyurethane resins. Every catalyst behaves differently: some are highly active at room temperature, some kick in only later on, when the resin has warmed up due to exotherm. Some are better at driving the early stages of polymerization, but stop shortly thereafter; some have a sustained effect until the very end. Some are highly selective toward the desirable isocyanate-polyol reaction, and some don't mind catalyzing the isocyanate-water reaction - which leads to the formation of bubbles of CO2. Some are very stable, and some deteriorate when exposed to open air and other substances, which may cause inhibition or poor surface cure. But there is no single product that gives you the very best on all fronts. For this reason, manufacturers combine various catalysts to reach a compromise that makes sense for their intended customers - but these parameters aren't necessarily ideal for your needs. For example, OC-5086 is a resin designed for larger castings; when dealing with tiny parts, it will cure too slowly, and with far too much sensitivity to ambient moisture. Thankfully, you can fix this on your own. 4.4.4.1. Speeding things up Ideally, if you wish to use OC-5086 or HP-21xx - or accelerate any other finicky resin - you should get bismuth neodecanoate from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Krackeler. The cost is around $35 for 250 g, and that amount will last you forever. The catalyst isn't dangerous, but both of these places have a blanket policy of shipping only to commercial addresses. If you can't have it shipped to work, ping the folks who run Chemsavers.com - they should be able to get it for you and ship it to your home for a very modest premium. Bismuth neodecanoate is a syrupy liquid which needs to be diluted with a plasticizer (e.g., DPGDB), a suitable polyol, acetone, or something else of that sort. Depending on the resins you are working with, you may have to experiment with dosage, but typically, levels between 50 and 500 ppm will be enough. For example, to "fix" OC-5086, you can prepare a 4% solution in plasticizer, and add it at about 1-2 drops per 10 ml of isocyanate as you are getting ready to mix it with a polyol. To speed up HP-21xx, you will need a solution closer to 50%, added in similar quantities. Now, if this particular bismuth compound is hard to find where you live, don't despair! A decent alternative is tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, also known as stannous octanoate. This substance is commonly sold as an accelerator for condensation-cure silicones; for example, a nearly pure form is available under brand names such as Smooth-On Accel-T, Quantum Silicones QSil STO, or Bluestar VICURE #2. Just be careful not to buy anything based on dibutyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin dineodecanoate, or a similar tin(IV) compound: they will work great, but also happen to be a lot more toxic. As with bismuth, the appropriate dosage varies depending on the resin; for OC-5086, a 4% solution, added at 1-2 drops per 10 ml of isocyanate, is a good starting point. Note that the compound is a bit more harmful than bismuth - handle it with care. Bismuth and tin aside, there are several other, more exotic options to choose from. They may offer very specific benefits, such as improved curing characteristics in particular systems, or no subsequent inhibition of platinum silicones (which are somewhat sensitive both to bismuth and tin). If you need additional guidance, click here to expand a section with some rough notes. Alternative catalysts: there is a large number of other catalysts used in polyurethane formulations. The list below includes some of the more common choices, along with an explanation why they aren't featured more prominently in this chapter: Other complexes of bismuth. According to scientific literature and tons of published patents, various other alcohol-soluble soaps of bismuth, including 2-ethylhexanoate and naphthenate, perform very well. Nevertheless, they are less common and tend to be more expensive. Complexes of zinc. Various zinc-containing compounds - including 2-ethylhexanoate, neodecanoate, and acetate - are commonly used as polyurethane catalysts. On the flip side, they are less potent than bismuth, tend to be less selective, and have a more non-linear temperature response - leading to higher exotherm in bulky castings and slower cure in thin sections. Triethylenediamine. A very potent catalyst, actually offering superior surface cure in products such as HP-21xx - so if you are doing a lot of work with amine-based formulations, go for it. On the flip side, it messes up resins such as OC-5086. Other non-metal catalysts. A fair number of other amines, imidazoles, and similar substances exhibit strong catalytic activity in polyurethanes, although most of them tend to favor the reaction with water over the reaction with polyols. There are several exceptions, but they tend to be difficult to find. Something like 1,2-dimethylimidazole or n-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole may work. Zirconium acetylacetonate. Reported as an excellent catalyst for some formulations, and a weak one for others. More exotic zirconium complexes are said to work more consistently, but are rare. Complexes of aluminum. Commonly reported as highly selective but low-potency catalysts. Aluminum acetylacetonate is commonly mentioned, but has fairly high acute toxicity. Safer compounds tend to have lower solubility or other drawbacks. Complexes of titanium. Sometimes cited as potent catalysts with unclear selectivity. I had a chance to test titanium isopropoxide once, with decidedly mixed results. As with zirconium, more exotic complexes may work better - not sure. Other metals. About half of all the metals in the periodic table shows some catalytic activity in polyurethanes; notable examples include iron, copper, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, vanadium, manganese - plus toxic elements such as mercury, lead, cobalt, and so on. In general, they tend to be less potent, less selective, or problematic for other reasons. There is also a long tail of other substances, including certain acids and bases, that show some catalytic activity - but usually need to be added in much higher quantities. Random rant: as noted above, most suppliers of lab chemicals are no longer willing to ship to residential addresses. Such restrictions make some sense for haz-mat materials - but the companies simply won't do any business with you, even if all you're trying to buy is salt or glucose. There are two reasons for this. First, there is a growing number of government agencies - ranging from DHS, to DEA, to CPSC (yes, that's right!) - that don't want people to make anything ranging from illicit drugs to bootleg fireworks. Companies that sell to individuals face a hodgepodge of regulations and vague reporting requirements, and risk police raids and other serious consequences if they mess up. Second, there are liability concerns: if a kid loses an eye and his parents sue - well, even if the manufacturer prevails in court, there are still legal expenses and bad PR to deal with. Because of this, it simply makes no sense for most of them to cater to the hobbyist market at all - shipping to a commercial address creates a pretense of due diligence, no matter how weak it may be. To keep chemistry alive as a hobby, I urge you to support the remaining few places that did not succumb to this trend; in particular, consider going with eBay sellers or friendly outlets such as Chemsavers even if you have an opportunity to order certain chemcials directly from the manufacturer for less. Just stay away from ScienceLab.com. 4.4.4.2. Slowing down the reaction In many types of polyurethane formulations, it is possible to slow down the reaction by converting the catalyst to a less ractive complex. In particular, systems that rely on amine catalysts (and do not contain reactive amines as crosslinkers or any other vital components of the formulation) can be slowed down with strong, non-oxidizing acids that react with the catalyst to form a largely inactive ammonium salt. In the same spirit, some of the less obnoxious thiols and certain other substances can chelate a variety of organometallic catalysts. In products such as IE-3075 or OC-5086, you can get good results with p-toluenesulfonic or methanesulfonic acid, both of which are available from Chemsavers for around $20. Methanesulfonic acid is slightly more convenient, because it is liquid at room temperature; but p-toluenesulfonic acid is pretty easy to directly dissolve in polyol. Levels around 0.1-0.5% by weight should have a very pronounced effect; just be careful not to go overboard: excess acid may react with isocyanates and mess things up. This graph shows the impact of p-toluenesulfonic acid on the curing exotherm of IE-3075, using the setup outlined earlier on: If PTSA or MSA are not easily available in your market, a much less potent but possibly still acceptable alternative is sulfamic acid, a common cleaning compound available on eBay and Amazon for just a couple of bucks. The main problem with this compound is its relatively poor solubility in polyols and in most organic solvents. A saturated solution in n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) may be your best bet; it will need to be added at a level closer to 1-2% by weight, which isn't exactly ideal. The solution is also not stable in the long haul, so prepare only as much as you intend to use in a couple of days. What else? If you really can't get any of the above, you can try tartaric acid. Along with several other weak, aliphatic hydroxy acids, this compound will inhibit the reaction to some extent, although it shows some interest in side ractions that may liberate bubbles of carbon dioxide or impart a yellowish hue to your parts. On the upside, it's a common food additive, available pretty much everywhere; and it can be easily dissolved in acetone. Note that PTSA, MSA, and sulfamic acid are all highly corrosive; use gloves and eye protection whenever working with concentrated solutions. Oh, one more thing: keep in mind that while adding catalysts to a resin is guaranteed to make a positive difference, adding a particular inhibitor is not. Of the fast-curing resins discussed in this guide, I never found a way to significantly slow down TP-405x, but almost everything else seems to be a fair game. 4.4.5. Blending several resins together Every now and then, you may be hoping to modify the properties of a resin in a way that goes beyond what's possible with non-reactive fillers, plasticizers, and so on. Other times, you may be interested in changing its cure speed in a situation where the methods outlined in the previous section are impractical or simply don't work. Well, the good news is that you can do quite a bit without resorting to making your own formulations from scratch. First of all, if you have two resins with comparably reactive isocyanates or polyols, and similar catalysts, you may be able to simply mix them together as-is. For example, let's say that you own HP-2150A and HP-2160D, and want to create a range of tough elastomers. The mix ratio is 100:43 for the first resin, 100:20 for the second one, and you want to blend them at a ratio of roughly 2:1 to get a rubber around 70 Shore A. In this case, suitable mixing amounts may be: HP-2150A isocyanate: 10 ml HP-2160D isocyanate: 5 ml HP-2150A polyol: 4.3 ml (10 ml * 43 / 100) HP-2160D polyol: 1 ml (5 ml * 20 / 100) Of course, if the systems are based on dissimilar chemistry, the resin may cure prematurely, not cure at all, or have disappointing mechanical properties. Even in this case, not all is lost: you may be able to get somewhere by starting with a single resin, and then partly or completely substituting one of its components with that belonging to another system. There are situations where it won't work, and situations where it will give you useful materials with faster or slower cure profiles, and mechanical properties somewhere between these of its constituents. The challenge with this second approach is figuring out the correct mixing ratio for isocyanate coming from product A, and polyol coming from product B; the manufacturer won't tell you how many reactive NCO and OH groups are there in each of the components, and without this information, you have to resort to trial and error. The correct ratio is usually between 100:30 and 80:100, and you can pinpoint it by doing several tests and selecting the range that resulted in the highest indentation hardness (Shore D durometer costs about $25-$50 on eBay); guessing the ratio within 5% should be fine in most uses. 4.4.6. Heat-accelerated cure As noted earlier, polyurethanes and silicones begin polymerizing the moment you mix the components; by the time you reach the demold time, the reaction is mostly over - but some cross-linking may continue for many days or weeks at an exponentially decaying rate. As this process goes on, the properties of the part will keep approaching these advertised in the datasheet. If you are impatient and want to demold your castings sooner than normally possible, but don't want to sacrifice pot life or deal with chemical catalysts, placing the mold in a temperature-controlled oven will typically cut the time in half per every 10° C over ambient. Alas, the combination of significant thermal expansion of silicones (0.025%/°C), and the somewhat lower but still noticeable expansion of rigid polyurethanes (0.005%/°C), will probably affect dimensional accuracy of the part - so if you are aiming for snap fits, it makes sense to keep the mold at room temperature for as long as you can, and then bake it at no more than perhaps 40° C. For an already demolded part, post-curing is a valuable process that involves fewer trade-offs, and lets you reach the final properties of the material in hours, rather than weeks; since the resin is already largely polymerized, and is not confined in an expanding mold, its own thermal expansion is less likely to have lasting effects. It's important to ramp up the temperature gradually, though, so that the part doesn't get too soft. I suggest one hour at 40° C, followed by 30 minutes at 60° C and 80° C; the cycle can be wrapped up with 1-3 hours at 100-110° C. Note that many polyurethanes begin to deteriorate around 150° C, and that for transparent formulations and flexible rubbers, this limit may be even lower. 4.4.7. Multi-part molds All right, all right - enough with chemistry. But there's one more topic that may help you in casting work. Sooner or later, you will need to make parts with complex features on multiple sides. When replicating hand-made shapes, the process is usually very intuitive; for example, the geometry can be submerged in a blob of silicone that is carefully dissected with a scalpel or a box cutter, and put together later on. The process for designing accurately meshing multi-part molds in CAD software isn't much more complicated, but may take some effort to wrap your head around it. Let's say you want to make a part with a cross-section as shown on the left (and some additional features that prevent us from simply laying the shape on its side): The first step is to make a regular mold similar to what we would do for one-sided parts, but also add a small pedestal around the geometry - this will serve as a registration mark. The second mold is simply the same part and its pedestal, flipped around; this top mold will neatly slide into the bottom one. Voila! In more complex molds, the parting line may be located less conveniently, and may not allow all the air to escape on its own. In these cases, the mold will typically have a sprue through which the resin is poured in, and strategically placed vents to allow the air to escape from tight spots; a reservoir of resin on top of the spruce will offset for shrinkage in large parts, too. All in all, it's not hard, but when it comes to that, you will need to practice a bit. 5. Essential parts for robot builders Righty-o. Now that we have the basics of machining, moldmaking, and resin casting covered to a good extent, it's useful to discuss more practical designs and part geometries of interest to robotics and other mechanical work. But before we dive into the inner workings of custom-designed gears and drivetrains, it's important to take a brief detour, and go over some of the prefabricated components that may come handy in your projects. Without a good source for tiny screws, springs, dowel pins, or cheap electronic sensors, you simply won't be able to get far. Rest assured, this chapter will merely scratch the surface of it all. If you are looking for inspiration, get "Machine Devices and Components Illustrated Sourcebook" by Parmley, or "Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook" by Sclater and Chironis; and if you need a primer on electronics, my concise guide to electronics for geeks may come handy, too. 5.1. Mechanical components 5.1.1. Screws and threaded rods Machine screws, also known as bolts, are one of the most important items to put on your shopping list: if you want to create durable, serviceable designs that can't be approximated with indiscriminate use of glue, suitable fasteners are simply a must. In tough plastics such as polyurethanes, the use of screws is particularly easy: simply machine a slightly undersized hole and drive the fastener into it, impressing its own thread onto the part. Much of the time, you don't need a nut! If you want to shop for useful sizes and quantities of machine screws, skip your local hardware store. There are three particularly good online sources for miniature and subminiature fasteners in bulk: Micro Fasteners, Fast Metal Products, and Amazon Supply. Micro Fasteners is a good all-around source for low-cost screws in diameters over 1.5 mm or so; FMP offers decent pricing on fasteners smaller than that. Last but not least, Amazon Supply (formerly Small Parts) tends to be a tad more expensive - but Amazon Prime customers get free two-day shipping on every single nut and bolt, so especially for small orders, it's quite a good deal. The exact selection of fasteners depends on the projects you intend to pursue, but I recommend starting with a good assortment of 0.8 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2 mm screws (000-120, 0-80, and 2-56 designations in ANSI UTS, respectively), 100 pieces each. You should grab the cheapest variety of steel or brass screws, aiming for lengths around 4, 6, 8, and 15 mm; drive type doesn't matter a lot - could be slotted, Phillips, or hex. Expect to pay around $2-$5 per 100 pieces for common diameters, and closer to $10-$15 for sizes under 1 mm. Getting some nuts and washers, especially for 2 mm screws, is not a bad plan - but as noted, you won't be routinely needing them. You may also want to look into threaded rods, available from sources such as Amazon - the diameter around 2 mm probably being the most useful. Their more boring use is an extended-reach screw (with one nut at each end); a more interesting possibility is creating extremely compact and simple linear motion systems, like so: Another possible arrangement is using a motor to directly rotate the shaft. In both cases, the transmission enjoys a very high ratio, because every turn of the motor moves the nut by a distance equal to the pitch of the shaft - often in the vicinity of 0.5 mm or so. The downside is poor efficiency - likely under 20% - due to significant friction under load. Note: when it comes to online retailers, many hobbyists also love McMaster-Carr as a source for screws and other mechanical components. That said, they are almost always significantly more expensive than specialized distributors, and often more expensive than Amazon. They do have good deals on some otherwise hard-to-find stuff - say, miniature timing belts - but it's more of an exception than a rule. 5.1.2. Dowel pins, rods, and tubes Traditional dowel pins are rather unassuming: they are just pieces of featureless, cylindrical steel, machined to tight tolerances. For their appearance, they find a truly surprising number of uses: as axles for spur gears and other rotating parts; as registration pins for molds and multi-part assemblies; as movement limiters and contact sensors; as serviceable torque couplers; and so on. You just need to have some - trust me on that. Non-tapered, solid metal dowel pins are available from many sources, including Small Parts / Amazon Supply, and cost very little - usually in the vicinity of $4 to $8 per 100 pieces. I suggest stocking up on 2 mm diameter pins in several lengths ranging from 4 to 20 mm. For high-precision work, 1 and 1.5 mm diameters may come handy, too. Dowel pins aside, it's also good to have some vanilla steel rods or tubes: they are very cheap (usually $1-$2 per meter), and can be cut to size with a hand saw to build anything from long-reaching axles (left) to fairly complex frames (right, also showing threaded rods used as linear motion systems): Metal bars with rectangular, hexagonal, or L-, I-, or T-shaped cross-sections are particularly useful for torque transfer, because you can simply slide components onto them, and there is no risk of slippage under radial load; perfectly round profiles may require the application of glue or the use of a lock screw. 5.1.3. Springs and spring wire Similarly to dowel pins, springs have quite a few uses; many of them are obvious (wheel suspension and other pre-tensioned mechanisms, energy storage, etc), but some aren't. For example, springs are indispensable for transfering rotary motion at an angle - a process that otherwise requires complex bevel gears or universal joints. Perhaps the most common sort is a compression spring: it has generous spacing between its coils, and is meant to contract under load. You can find them inside many types of pens, spray bottles, and so on. The other popular type is an extension spring: it is tightly wound, and offers little or no compressive action - but stretches very well. It's difficult to recommend a particular selection of compression and extension springs up front, but it's definitely a good idea to have a robust variety always available in your workshop, simply to prototype stuff easily. Possibly the best and least expensive assortment I have seen so far is this set - 200 reasonably sized springs for less than $9; comparable kits are also available on Amazon. A great selection of individual springs with specific diameter, pitch, and length, can be also found on Amazon, usually in packs of 10. Traditional springs aside, you should also grab some spring wire (also known as music wire). It comes handy for making contact sensors (especially whiskers!), for creating simple tensioners, and for designing other devices where you want to use a straight piece of elastic material to deflect effortlessly, and then spring back to its original shape. There are many low-cost assortments you can find on the Internet - and as usual, Amazon isn't bad. 5.1.4. Ball bearings There are many situations where it is desirable to constrain rotary movement to a particular axis of rotation, and support it so that the part doesn't wiggle back and forth, or snap under load. Sleeve bearings are the simplest solution: you can route the rotating part through a round, slightly oversized opening, and perhaps use a bit of grease to minimize friction. Alas, this approach has its limits: if the part is rotating very quickly, or if it's subject to significant radial forces, sleeve bearings will result in significant power losses or excessive wear. In particular, sleeve bearings for propellers and wheels may have a very limited lifespan. Because of this, you should get a decent assortment of ball bearings, and use them when appropriate. There are many sources of bearings on the Internet, but most of them tend to be pricey; VXB.com is a notable exception to this rule. They ship internationally and have an amazing selection of 10-, 20-, 30-, or even 100-packs at sensible prices - often hovering around $1 to $1.50 per piece. Some comparably good or even better deals can be found in the $0.99 discount bin or the 10-pack-section of Boca Bearings, too - although their "regular" prices are higher than VXB. Some of my favorite bearing sizes (ID x OD x H) are: 3x6x2 mm (link, $1 a piece, only for miniature projects); 6x10x3 mm (link, $1.50); 8x12x3.5 mm (link, $1.50); and 8x16x5 mm (link, $1). For larger projects, 8x22x7 mm bearings are a bargain, too - trading for about 50 cents a piece or less (link). If you don't have any specific designs in mind, but plan to work on small to medium-scale projects, grabbing a set of 6x10x3 mm or 8x12x3.5 mm bearings is not a waste of money. 5.1.5. Gears and timing belts When building precision mechanical assemblies, it is usually much more convenient (and a lot cheaper) to make your own gears than to source them online. Part of the reason for this is that most of the time, you will want to use compound gears with very specific diameters, heights, tooth counts and ratios, axle bore sizes, and so on. Chances are, you won't be able to find just the right ready-made options online, at least not on the cheap. Timing belts are a different story, in part because they are tend to be simpler. Whether you need timing belts is a good question; they do offer an alternative form of gearing in applications where other solutions are inconvenient to use because of size constraints or the distances involved. For example, they may offer a space-saving way to couple a motor to a wheel without reducing ground clearance. Another popular use is in linear motion systems, where they can acutate any assembly clamped to the belt (and mounted on some sort of a rigid slide to keep it from flopping around). Historically, timing belts used to be fairly expensive and difficult to source in miniature sizes, but this has changed over the past few years. One of the best sources for small timing belts, many for around $1.50 a piece, is McMaster-Carr; check out the MXL series for some very good picks. Some of their smallest ones are just about 10 mm long and 3 mm wide. Timing belts run quiet and have very little backlash, but they are less durable and less rigid than plastic gears; they may be somewhat less efficient, too. 5.2. Robot-related electronics 5.2.1. Motors The selection of motors at your disposal is definitely the single most important factor affecting the ability to bring your electromechanical designs to life. It's also something very easy to get wrong - or get right, but grossly overspend on. It is probably safe to assume that you are interested primarily in small, low-voltage DC motors; if so, the choice is roughly as follows: Vanilla brushed motors: the traditional variety, with rotating electromagnets and a mechanical commutator that powers them up in a particular sequence. The most important advantage of this class of motors is the broad availability of many different form factors, often at ridiculously low prices ($1-$2). That allows you to buy them by the dozen, and helps with rapid prototyping. Unfortunately, these motors operate efficiently only at very high RPM, and deliver fairly low torque, requiring the use of external gearboxes in almost every application; such gearboxes aren't difficult to make, but they add some complexity. The motors are also electrically noisy, and their lifespan is limited by the wear of commutator brushes - an issue in continuous-duty applications. Geared motors: these typically consist of a small brushed motor coupled to an integral gearbox that reduces output RPM, and brings the torque up to a more useful range. They usually operate with decent efficiency (85-95%) and offer transmission ratios of 20:1 to 400:1 or so. The main trade-off is that many of the lower-cost plastic gear transmissions are flimsy and rather unwieldy, so in many applications, it may be more desirable to create them yourself; higher quality alternatives, and planetary gearboxes in particular, often fetch as much as $20-$150. As a rule of thumb, it makes little or no sense to buy anything that looks like this; microminiature metal gears are a usually better investment, and if you look around, you may be able to find them under $8 a pop. R/C servos: affordable motors in this category usually consist of a geared motor coupled to a gearbox, a potentiometer attached to the output shaft, and a small integrated circuit that uses this feedback loop to maintain a position requested by the external microcontroller. The huge advantage of servos is the ease of use: they eliminate the need for additional sensors, H-bridge drivers, and other widgets normally involved in the control of a regular motor. Unfortunately, most of the low-cost servos are pretty bulky - a brick about 4-5 times the size of the actual motor within; most of them are also not capable of performing 360° turns, owing to the design of the internal potentiometer. On top of that, most of the plastic-geared servos are somewhat fragile - the sale of replacement gears is an industry of its own. Vanilla brushless: brushless motors deal away with mechanical commutation, and instead, have a rotor with permanent magnets, surrounded by stationary electromagnets that are switched electronically in a specific sequence. They are more durable than their brushed counterparts, and because of improved heat dissipation, occupy a smaller, more lightweight envelope. The key challenge with brushless motors is that they require precise external control to operate with good efficiency, often incorporating current sensors or Hall effect detectors; this adds cost and complexity. The other issue is that almost all the commonly available brushless motors are designed for high-current, high-performance applications, such as model aircraft - and with their extreme speeds and power demands, they are not particularly well-tailored for projects with more modest needs. Stepper motors: steppers are similar to brushless motors, but use a different rotor design with multiple densely packed poles; this makes the motor turn only by a small, precisely defined degree every time one of the coils is switched (7.5° or 15° is common in small motors; 1.8° in larger ones). There is no position sensing; their high-resistance coils are designed to let them hold a particular position without overheating, but limit their ability to operate at high speeds (their efficiency drops rapidly past perhaps 300 RPM or so). The primary advantage of stepper motors is their high precision, ease of operation, and competent performance at relatively low speeds, suitable for directly operating many types of mechanical assemblies. Their disadvantage is that they are essentially a constant-current device, sinking the same amount of power when freewheeling and under load. Exotic actuators: somewhat disappointingly, there aren't that many alternatives to plain old motors. Linear actuators are interesting, but typically prohibitively expensive ($100 and more). Solenoids, often used in door locks, are pretty cheap, but usually of limited utility. Lastly, "muscle wire", a material that contracts slightly (5% or so) when heated up by the flow of electric current, may sound cool - but because of the small displacement and fragility, it's more of a novelty than a practical tool. As you can see, there is no perfect solution. I personally prefer sticking to vanilla brushed motors and creating my own gearboxes, but if your patience can wear thin, servos or geared motors may be a better choice. For any of these motors, you should definitely look at the following characteristics when shopping around: Maximum rated voltage: every motor is designed for a particular maximum voltage, past which it may overheat or blow up in some other fashion. You can operate any motor at as little as 20% of its rated voltage - but in such a case, you will be hauling around a lot of dead weight in the form of windings, magnets, and so on, that are grossly oversized and serve no useful purpose. In general, motors rated for somewhere between 3 and 9V are probably of most use in small- to medium-size projects, owing to the availability of affordable batteries and power-switching transistors compatible with these voltages. Going beyond 12V can be expensive, and is best avoided unless you are building something big. No-load RPM and stall torque: these two parameters describe the behavior of the motor at two extremes: its speed when freewheeling with no load, and the turning force needed to effectively stop the motor in its tracks. In both of these cases, the motor is not doing any useful work, and its efficiency is zero. In between, the dependency between RPM and torque is roughly linear: with a load equal to 80% of the stall torque, the RPM will hover around 20%. This dependency may suggest that instead of using complex gears, it may be possible to simply operate the motor with a carefully tuned load of 95%, thus reducing its speed down to 5%. Unfortunately, this is usually a bad idea. In essence, every motor has a specific efficiency curve - and for low-power DC motors, it typically looks like this: the device is most efficient when the load is around 20%, and the performance drops off somewhat linearly past this point, eventually reaching 0% at stall. Therefore, in any application where power consumption and heat dissipation are of concern, it's good to operate the motor at somewhere between 5% and 50% of its maximum load most of the time; outside that range, you're just heating the air. To understand what you will be getting out of a specific motor, and to compare different products, it is often useful to compute their normalized torque: the torque they will be able to deliver when paired with a gearbox that brings their speed to a particular value (say, 100 RPM). Assuming that you are aiming for a load of 50%, and that the gearbox has an efficiency of 85%, the formula will be: normalized_torque = (stall_torque * 50%) * (idle_RPM * 50%) / 100 * 85% = stall_torque * idle_RPM / 470 Stall current: this parameter should help you size the power supply and all the associated driver circuits. When multiplied by the supply voltage and compared to normalized torque, it may be helpful for comparing the efficiency of various motors, too. Dimensions: all things being equal, the smaller the better - but form factors matter, too. Long but slim motors are preferable for wheeled robots, as they result in optimum ground clearance when placed inline with or near the axle; while pancake-shaped motors with a large diameter but short length are much better when you need to cram them inside an articulated joint in a legged robot without anything sticking out. Possibly the best source to find a great assortment of low-cost brushed motors (both vanilla and geared) is Kysan Electronics; they have a $100 minimum on all online orders, but seem to be willing to make exceptions if necessary. Good deals can be also sometimes found at various surplus outlets, including All Electronics, Electronic Goldmine, Surplus Shed, BG Micro, or HSC Supply - but their inventory can change rapidly, so your mileage may vary. Last but not least, for servos and brushless motors, Hobby King is hard to beat - they ship from Hong Kong, but do so promptly and cheaply; on orders under $200 or so, you are unlikely to run into import duties. Whatever you do, I'd recommend avoiding robotics-oriented sources such as Solarbotics, Robotics Connection, Pololu, Acroname, and many more. They are good people, but they usually sell exactly the same low-cost motors, and simply charge you more for the privilege of shopping with them. Case in point: this motor costs $23 when bought from Robot Marketplace, or $16 when you go to Solarbotics - but Kysan Electronics carries it for $8 a piece... or just $3 on orders over 1,000 (which is probably the price that the first two shops have paid). In any case, it makes sense to find 2-4 models that are best suited for your needs, and then buy 10-20 pieces of each; having a steady supply of well-performing motors beats having one or two of every mediocre product available on the market. My personal recommendations are: Vanilla brushed: Mabuchi FF-N20PN ("8117" or "8721") ($1.00): one of the tiniest motors I found that can still pack a punch (pager motors are smaller, but offer negligible torque). Diameter of 10 / 12 mm, length of 15 mm. When operated at 3V, it idles around 13,000 RPM, and delivers about 15 g*cm of stall torque - drawing 1.3A at that point. Great for miniature projects. (That motor seems to be hard to find these days; FF-N20PA-11155 motors available from Kysan are a close match, but cost a bit more - just under $2.) Mabuchi RF-356CA-10250 ($2.20): a reasonably powerful pancake-shaped motor for all-around use. Diameter of 24 mm, 8 mm long. About 11,000 RPM, 40 g*cm, 600 mA at stall when running at 6V. RF-300FA-12350 is a cheaper alternative, but it's 4 mm longer and has a lower speed. Mabuchi FF-130SH-14230-6V ($1.90): an elongated all-purpose motor that delivers 13,000 RPM when idling, and stalls around 115 g*cm, drawing 1.3A, when operated at 10V. Diameter of 15.5 / 20.5 mm, length of 25 mm. A comparable but slightly larger 12V alternative is Canon EN22. Spur geared motors: Sanyo 12GN-0348-NA3S and 12GN-0348-NA4S ($7.50): two cheap, robust, extremely small metal gear motors delivering about 2,200 g*cm (NA3S) and 3,500 g*cm (NA4S) of stall torque, and idling around 100 and 70 RPM, respectively. Both run at 6V. Their tiny dimensions make it worthwhile: they measure just 12 x 10 x 25 mm. Stepper motors: Symbol Technologies 21-02485 ($1.00): about 20 mm wide and 12 mm thick; a 5-wire hybrid that is best operated in bipolar mode (where the polarity of the windings needs to be reversed, necessitating the use of H-bridge drivers), and runs fine at 9V. 15° per step, 100 mA per coil, around 40 g*cm of torque. Unfortunately, appears to be out of stock right now. Epson STP35NI48SV50 ($3.00): a larger stepper motor, 35 mm wide and 12 mm thick. Unipolar operation (can be controlled with a couple of transistors), 7.5° per step, 12V, 250 mA per coil, around 220 g*cm of torque. Servos: Mini Man 4.3 ($3.50): a really cheap, miniature 6V servo of acceptable quality, delivering around 500 g*cm of stall torque. Its speed is about 10 RPM with no load. Hextronik HXT900 ($2.65): more powerful, slightly larger servo - 1,600 g*cm at stall, 40 RPM under no load, runs off of 6V. Very popular with hobbyists. Hextronik HXT5010 ($4.50): a larger, ball bearing servo capable of delivering about 6,500 g*cm at stall. It's slow - 8 RPM with no load at 6V. Reportedly can be modified to rotate 360°.

Useful sensors Sensors are essential in almost any electromechanical design, helping interact with the outside world, and providing internal feedback about the state of mechanical assemblies. This section covers some of the most useful, low-cost choices to consider in your work: Tactile switches: simple, small, cheap, and very versatile. When placed behind an elastic bumper, they can work as a wall sensor for wheeled robots; in conjunction with rubberized foot or a floating axle, they can sense contact of the robot body with the ground; and when used as a movement limiter, they are useful for detecting the "home" position of many assemblies. A wide selection of microswitches in all shapes and sizes is available from Mouser and from other major electronics outlets. Pricing starts at $0.10 or so a piece when bought in reasonable quantities; be sure to look at dimensions, trigger force, and button travel. In most cases, it makes sense to stock up on the smallest, low-profile non-SMD switches you can find - for example, Mountain Switch 101-TS4311T1601-EV ($0.20). Larger ones - such as ALPS SKHCBFA010 ($0.30) - may be useful when a greater pressure-sensitive area is desired. Photointerruptors: extremely useful for non-contact position sensing when you don't want to obstruct the motion of a component. They work by shining an IR LED on the element, and then measuring the reflected or transmitted light with a phototransistor. My favorite is a tiny, wide-slot Toshiba TLP841 ($0.40); for reflective applications, Optek OPB609AX ($0.55) may come handy, too. Mechanical rotary encoders: these can be used to measure the angular position of an assembly. They use mechanical coupling, and therefore add some friction - but often offer a convenient alternative to optical sensing. Linear sensors, such as ALPS RDC803001A ($1.50), leverage a heavy-duty rotary potentiometer with several taps; pulsed devices, such as Mountain Switch 101-5433-EV ($0.55), simply alternate between closed and open circuit at predefined angles, commonly producing 12 or 24 pulses per turn. Only linear sensors will provide the absolute position, but they cost more, and require an A/D converter to interpret the data. Magnetic field sensors: solid-state Hall effect sensors such as Honeywell S41 ($0.50) can work very much like a photointerruptor, but will sense the position of a tiny permanent magnet embedded in the rotating element; their primary benefit is much lower power consumption, and the fact that they can "see" through opaque materials, enclosures, and so forth. Distance sensors: these can be positioned either in a fixed location on the robot body, or rotated to sweep the environment in a manner similar to a radar - creating a 2D image that is a lot more more useful than the data that can be acquired with a digital camera, especially if you don't have too much computing power to spare. The two most common rangefinding options are infrared and ultrasound. Infrared sensors are cheaper, but have a limited sensing range, and may be considerably less effective in very bright light (e.g., outdoors); Sharp GP2Y0A02YK is probably the most interesting option here, selling for under $15. For ultrasound, you must be prepared to pay a bit more; for example, MaxBotix LV MaxSonar EZ2 fetches around $25. Digital compasses: these may be useful in robots that need to maintain precise registration with the environment over extended periods of time. You can choose from specialized solid-state Hall effect sensor ICs, such as Honeywell HMC1051; and regular Hall effect sensors that monitor the position of a traditional compass needle (an example of that is Dinsmore 1490 or 1655). Expect to pay $10 to $40. Other fancy sensors: some designs - especially flying robots - may benefit from accelerometers, such as MMA8453QT ($1.40); flex sensors; heat sensors; inclinometers; tilt switches; microphones; digital cameras; or GPS units. That said, these are usually selected for a specific application, and there is no need to keep a continuous stock. 5.2.3. IC glue and MCUs If you have a favorite brand of microcontrollers, there is probably no need to revisit this topic; but if you are looking for advice, it's pretty hard to go wrong with AVR chips such as ATmega1284P ($8). This particular 8-bit MCU, for example, operates at speeds up to 20 MHz (internal oscillator is provided), has 128 kB of Flash memory for program storage, 16 kB of data memory (SRAM), and 4 kB of non-volatile EEPROM. It's essentially a complete computer-on-chip, complete with 32 bidirectional I/O lines, 8-channel 10-bit ADC, hardware PWM channels - all that supporting a wide range of supply voltages, from 1.8 to 5.5 V; there are precious few external components required to operate it in most real-world applications. ATmega chips have a mature GCC-based toolchain with tons of useful libraries, a nice emulator, and a pretty good IDE - and unless you are doing complex image processing or working on something else data-intensive, they will serve you well. (In more demanding tasks, you may need to spend quite a bit more on 32-bit ARM or AT32 chips; I also like Intel Edison.) For ATmega, the only other gadget you need is a simple USB ISP dongle (e.g., AVRISP mkII), costing somewhere between $15 and $30 - and even that can be avoided if you opt for a chip with a built-in USB controller. Note: some people love AVR-based development platforms such as Arduino or Teensy. I am personally wary of these boards, because I find them to offer very few real benefits over the AVR chip itself; you are essentially charged a 1000% markup in exchange for someone soldering the chip to a PCB, and then adding several components that are completely unnecessary in many uses, but make it look sophisticated (e.g., voltage regulators, external crystals). Especially when developing more complex software, you may find it useful to add a way for the MCU to communicate essential information in an easily readable way. Tethering it to a computer is one option, but you may also consider getting an LCD module based on a well-known HD44780 chip; for example, NHD-0216K1Z-NSB-FBW-L ($11) is a very user-friendly device with ample display space. It can be controlled with as few as 6 data lines, and is pretty trivial to interface with - its dedicated controller maintains its own display memory, and even stores editable font data and track of the cursor for you, so you just have to send ASCII data to the appropriate port. In addition to the MCU itself, you should also have a good assortment of standard "glue" chips that are useful for example in multiplexing and demultiplexing applications, and will allow you to extend the I/O capabilities of your chip almost arbitrarily. Probably the best IC family to stick to is 74HC - they are widely available and fairly cheap ($0.10 - $0.35 per chip), and offer respectable speeds and good load driving capabilities. You may want to grab basic logic gates (74HC00, 02, 04, 08, 32, 86 - NAND, NOR, NOT, AND, OR, and XOR respectively); line drivers (74HC240, 241, or 244); multiplexers, demultiplexers (74HC164, 165); line selectors (74HC137, 42, 151); and flip-flops / latches (74HC175, 75, 259). Some projects may also have uses for counters, timers (e.g., 7555), external oscillators, assorted op-amps, etc. About the only thing you can't do with all these parts is driving any power-hungry loads, such as motors: the tiny transistors inside most MCUs and 7400 series chips can output at best around 20-40 mA per line - enough for a LED or two, but not much more. It is possible to use discrete power MOSFETs (e.g., BUK7510) to control high-current devices, but doing so is not always space- and cost-efficient - so you may want to look into IC-based motor drivers. FAN8082 is probably the cheapest ($0.40) full H bridge (i.e., bidirectional) driver capable of delivering up to 1.5A at 18V to brushed motors and bipolar steppers; it even comes with rudimentary speed control. The disadvantages of this chip are its reltively high voltage drop (almost 2V), and the fact that it doesn't support "freewheeling" (high impedance) mode. Somewhat more expensive TA7291P ($0.90, 2A peak at 20V) supports all four output states: forward, reverse, brake, and freewheel; TLE52052 chip ($3.50, 6A peak at 40V) can drive even larger motors with ease. Several dozen similar products exist - shop around, and grab at least around 10 pieces or so. For driving unipolar steppers, solenoids, and other power equipment where you don't need to change polarity, you can also save some money by going with simpler devices: ULN2003 ($0.30) can drive up to 6 devices at 500 mA and 50V (or one device at 3A); while ULN2065 ($2) has four outputs capable of delivering 1.5A at 35V, adding up to 6A total. 5.2.4. Power sources, watchdogs, regulators About the last major set of electronic components that you need to think about are the power sources you will be using in your work. To make the right call, you need to consider several factors: Nominal voltage: in most cases, you should use a power source that provides perhaps 10-15% more than the voltage required by the most power-hungry components of your design - and that's usually the motors. In general, somewhere between 3.5 and 11 V is ideal. Capacity: try to estimate the power needs of your circuit, and aim for something that would give you a sensible run time on a single charge. For example, if you are expecting to sink 100 mA on average, you will get up to 8 hours out of any 800 mAh cell. Peak current / ESR: make sure that the cell can accommodate the expected peak current draw of your device, with a generous safety margin. This matters: for example, a typical 9V battery will typically source no more than 1A - and once you exceed that, the voltage will drop dramatically. Weight and dimensions: there are substantial differences in power density between various cell types, so pay close attention to these characteristics, especially if you are trying to build something lightweight. Today, the best all-around option for robotics are rechargeable lithium-polymer cells, simply because of an excellent balance between capacity, weight, and cost. My favorite source is Hobby King. They have good products, and although they are in Hong Kong, they ship cheaply, quickly, and with no hassle whatsoever. If you browse their site, you can find a 7.4V 5 Ah cell, weighing around 300 g, for about $25; a smaller 1.6 Ah cell fetches $10 and tips the scales at 90 gram; while a tiny 800 mAh one weighs barely 50 g and costs $5. Of course, nothing comes free: lithium batteries have two drawbacks that you should know about. First of all, if they are charged improperly or badly damaged, they can overheat and catch fire - so you need to store and handle them with some care. The other issue is that they shouldn't be discharged past a certain minimum voltage to avoid altering their chemistry; using a voltage cut-off IC, such as MAX8211 or MAX8212, is a very good idea. Of course, there are many alternatives to Li-poly; a typical AA battery is nothing to sneeze at, and delivers up to 3 Ah, with peak current as high as 10A; your usual 9V battery is closer to 500 mAh and can't source more than 1A. If weight is not an issue, you can also go with lead-acid batteries, of course: they are cheap, but weight a ton ($20 will get you 15 Ah at 6V, but be prepared to haul around 2 kg). Ultracapacitors are also of some interest in recent years - but right now, they tend to be fairly expensive, especially if you are interested in supply voltages over 2.5V or so. Last but not least, solar cells deserve a honorable mention - although similarly to ultracapacitors, they are not that practical in everyday uses. Because of their lamentable power capabilities in function of their size, they are useful mostly as a way to conveniently recharge a chemical battery or a capacitor, and not as a continuous primary supply. Oh, one more thing: for prototyping, I recommend grabbing an adjustable benchtop power supply, such as Mastech GPS-3030D ($90); convenience of being able to quickly adjust voltage aside, their huge benefit is that you can limit the current to a safe value, so that an accidental short-circuit will not destroy everything in its path. The same can't be said about most batteries. Tip: the reason why you should match the supply voltage with the most power-hungry components in your circuit is that high-current DC voltage adjustments can be pretty tricky. It's easy to lower the voltage supplied to a low-current device, such as a microcontroller or a couple of LEDs: just grab a linear regulator such as LM317T ($0.25) or L7805 ($0.50) and be done with it. For efficient regulation of higher currents, or for stepping the voltage up, you generally need switched regulators, however. Such regulators are fairly complicated to build on your own, and get expensive if you want a plug-and-play solution. For example, ICL7660 - a chip that can handle up to 20 mA - goes for $2; Murata OKR-T3-W12-C - a hybrid device that can deliver up to 3A - retails for $7; and a 6A variant of the same Murata product will fetch $14. 5.2.5. Other components Well, it goes without saying that you will also need an assortment of generic electronic components to get anywhere: make sure that you have a bunch of resistors and capacitors, a handful of PCB mount potentiometers, some medium-power MOSFET transistors (n- and p-channel), a good selection of terminal blocks and ribbon connectors, a solderless breadboard or two for prototyping, perforated boards in various sizes, and so on. In fact, if you need any help with selecting the right components and using them in a circuit, check out my short primer on electronics in your spare time. What else? If you want to make your own PCBs for finished projects, you can of course print and etch them - although keep in mind that it's also quick and easy - and often more precise - to machine them on your CNC mill: you can simply selectively remove copper plating from a blank board with a cutter - and drill mounting holes at the same time. And of course, don't forget about installing a conveniently located and obvious self-destruct switch! 6. Practical part geometries To wrap up the discussion of technical topics, let's go over a collection of practical approaches that should help you create useful and reliable mechanical designs for small- to medium-sized projects - no matter if you are using CNC machining, 3D printing, or still carving stuff in stone. The failure to get even the most rudimentary understanding of these topics is one of the cardinal sins of hobbyist makers - so don't let this happen to you. 6.1. Basic part design tips The mathematics of material engineering are fairly obtuse, and the finite element modeling software that can be used to model the dynamic behavior of real-world part geometries is prohibitively expensive. Nevertheless, if you are designing small- to medium-scale components and can afford to learn from mistakes every now and then, there is a couple of simple rules of thumb you can follow to get great results without resorting to any of that. (You can also find quite a few good engineering tips on this page.) 6.1.1. Rigidity management Perhaps the most profound cognitive dissonance you can experience during your first adventures in DIY manufacturing is making the first part that happens to be long, thin, and flat. Let's say you grabbed IE-3075 and cast a piece that is 2 mm thick, 1 cm wide, and 15 cm long; you will be probably impressed by how difficult it is to break this sample - but also shocked by how easily it deflects. It just doesn't seem to make any sense: the datasheet says that the material is ought to be 50% more rigid than the plastic used to make Lego bricks, and several times less flexible than the commodity plastics used in everything from toaster ovens to computer cases. But your toaster doesn't flex nearly as much, right? To understand what's going on, consider what would happen if you applied the same bending force to the side of the part, rather than the top: If you do that, you won't be able to flex the part even the slightest bit. The cross-section of the material is still the same - 2 x 10 mm - but all of sudden, it is a lot more willing to resist your efforts. That's because flexing the material amounts to stretching the polymer chains farther apart on one side of the part, and squeezing them close together on the other end. If the material is thin, the effect is relatively modest, and you don't need to invest a lot of energy to make it happen. For thicker segments, the displacement is a lot more dramatic, however: The effect is pretty significant. Simplifying slightly, the rigidity of the part is proportional to the width of the sample - but to the cube of its thickness. This behavior brings us to the manufacturing trick that is being used in almost every item made out of plastic or sheet metal - including toasters and Lego bricks. In essence, you can greatly improve rigidity by increasing the maximum span of the part in the direction subjected to bending loads - without adding any significant bulk. The most common approach is the addition of a couple properly oriented ribs: The average thickness of the part - and thus its weight or the amount of plastic used - hasn't changed significantly. But because each of these ribs contributes to rigidity in proportion to the cube of their height, their impact is more significant than it may seem. The following picture is a good example of the use of ribs to control the rigidity of a thin-walled chassis of a medium-size robot. Note how the ribs are routed around any locations where additional clearance is required, and not interfere with the mechanical design. In fact, they probably improve the overall aesthetics: It is also possible to achieve the same effect without having to introduce any "standalone" ribs; for example, if the part uses curved surfaces or happens to have outer walls, this can provide a comparable degree of reinforcement: Properly reinforced thin-walled parts weigh less, cost less, provide more clearance for other components, exhibit much less shrinkage - and often simply look better. Because of this, try to learn and use these approaches as often as possible. Stick to 1 to 1.5 mm as a baseline wall thickness for all the larger parts - especially for chassis components, covers, etc - and just sprinkle them liberally with ribs, gussets, and other features of this sort. A handful of ribs extending 2-4 mm from the surface of the part is usually all you need to make it work. 6.1.2. Stress distribution So far, we've talked about the need to reinforce thin, long, planar surfaces; but there is one more situation where a small amount of extra plastic routinely saves the day. From the discussion of casting resins earlier in this guide, you may recall that the resistance of these materials to non-uniform loads (e.g., tearing) is dramatically lower than the ability to withstand uniformly distributed stress. For this reason, you should pay close attention to sharp corners, jagged edges, holes, and similar features in locations subjected to significant loads - and incorporate simple reinforcements to ensure that the stress isn't concentrated in any single spot. For example, when designing a coupling for an axle that may be subject to strong radial forces and shock, adding a fillet or a couple of load-bearing gussets can save the day; all other things being equal, the "vanilla" approach shown on the left is much more likely to fail: Given the negligible cost of these features, it typically makes no sense to spend too much time trying to figure out in which exact spots they happen to be absolutely necessary. Whenever it is clear that a localized stress may occur, throwing in a rib, a gusset, or a fillet is simply a good plan. 6.1.3. Fitting tolerances Another problem that a novice designed may bump into is the question of fitting tolerances: when one part needs to mate with another, what should their respective dimensions be to form the desired type of fit? The correct answer depends on a number of factors, including the accuracy of your CNC mill, or the operating conditions of the assembly (temperature, risk of contamination, running speed). Nevertheless, when working with a reasonably accurate milling machine and dealing with normal circumstances, the following rules of thumb tend to work pretty well for rigid plastics: Snug fit: if you want the parts to mesh tightly - for example, to be glued or fastened together - make the opening exactly the same size as the mating part. Interference fit: if you want the parts to hold together without any additional fastening, you can undersize the opening by about 0.01 to 0.02 mm (i.e., offset the profile curve by 0.005 to 0.01 mm). Note that you will need to use force to make them fit, so this may be not an option for fragile parts or unusually brittle resins. Low-friction meshing: to allow a round element to rotate with minimal friction, it's usually sufficient to leave a clearance of around 0.02 mm (offset of 0.01 mm). Note that for high radial loads, ball bearings may be preferable to sleeve couplings. Self-tapping holes for machine screws: measure, look up, or calculate the minor diameter of the screw (the outer diameter minus the depth of the thread). Use this as a diameter for the hole. A drop of WD-40 will help drive the screw in for the first time. When in doubt, be quick to experiment: it takes just a couple minutes to machine a rectangular or cylindrical test piece and play with it. Save yourself the time and frustration of having to debug issues in more complex parts. 6.2. Creating spur gears Gears are an extremely versatile tool that will come handy in all sorts of mechanical assemblies. Depending on your needs, they can reduce or increase the speed of movement, adjust torque, or change the direction, axis, and type of motion - all that with high precision, excellent efficiency (95%+), and great load-bearing capabilities. Alas, unfortunately for hobbyists, much of the freely available information about the geometry of common types of gears is misleading or incomplete - and even the articles posted on Wikipedia are littered with inaccurate images or animations such as this. The key property of a well-designed set of gears is that they transfer motion almost exclusively through a rolling action, with very little sliding (and thus friction) involved; and that they maintain constant velocity and a constant angle of contact through the process. If you violate these principles, your gears will become inefficient, noisy, and prone to vibration. The optimal design is exemplified by the ubiquituos involute spur gear: The blue lines shown on this picture are the theoretical pitch circles of the gears; if you replaced the gears with idealized rubber rollers of these diameters, the behavior of the transmission would not change. The linear speed of any mating gears is the same when measured along the pitch circle, and the ratio of angular speeds depends on the ratio of their pitch diameters. For example, if one of the gears has a pitch circle with a diameter of 10 cm, and it's turning another gear with a pitch diameter of 4 cm, one turn of the former will rotate the latter by 10 / 4 = 2.5 turns. Before getting any real work done, you need to make up your mind about several key parameters that will define the gears used in a particular project; except for tooth count, these values should be the same for any two gears that are supposed to mesh with each other. 6.2.1. Tooth count This parameter depends chiefly on the transmission ratios you are hoping to achieve. The only constrain here is that with very low tooth counts, you will see a behavior known as undercutting: the two meshing gears will collide, necessitating the introduction of some additional clearance - and thus weakening the part: This is not a big deal if the undercut is small; but when it begins to extend significantly into the area where power transfer takes place - that is, the region above the so-called base line, the gray circle shown in the earlier animation - the performance of the gear may be compromised. To avoid having to heavily compensate for this issue, unless exceptional circumstances apply, try to keep tooth counts over 8-9 or so. Note: most of the gear generators you can find online can't deal with undercuts at all: quite simply, if you try to specify fewer than a certain number of teeth, they will reject your input or generate an incorrect result. Avoid these like a plague - and scroll down for better alternatives. As for the maximum number of teeth - there is no real limit to how far you can go, but to keep your models simple and the cutting process rapid, it's preferable to keep the count under 100 or so. 6.2.2. Tooth width This parameter is measured at the pitch circle. The tooth must be wide enough to allow the mating region to be machined with the tools you happen to have at your disposal; in fact, it's advisable to use tooth width at least 30% greater than the diameter of the smallest end mill in your collection. In precision applications that do not involve extreme torques, the value will typically range from 0.3 to 1 mm - and 0.6 mm is a good starting point. You may want to increase the width when working with larger models, to keep the number of teeth sane. 6.2.3. Pressure angle When you look back at the animation shown earlier in this section, you will notice a slanted line that goes through the center. This is the path along which the gears come into contact, and the actual torque transfer takes place. The slant of this slope can be selected to suit your needs, but it needs to be reflected in the geometry of the resulting teeth: In general, low pressure angles result in quiet-running, precise gears that are easy to machine due to generous clearances - but will be weaker, and have more pronounced undercuts. High pressure angles result in thicker tooth profiles which need to be machined with smaller tools, and can be more noisy and prone to backlash and slippage - but also survive a lot more abuse. Sensible values for this parameter range from 12° to 25° or so - and my personal favorite for miniature assemblies is 17.5°. 6.2.4. Addendum The addendum is the distance by which every tooth sticks out above the pitch (contact) circle. The recommended value that ensures continuous and smooth torque transfer is tooth_width * 2 / π, with some wiggle room if you are pressed for space or are running into other constraints. Going below 70% of the recommended distance should be done at your own risk. To minimize undercuts when dealing with low pressure angles and low tooth counts, you can use a larger addendum on the smaller of the two meshing gears, and a smaller addendum on the other one. This technique, known as profile shift, is particularly useful for gears with fewer than 12 teeth, where it can significantly reduce undercuts without compromising machinability (right): Of course, profile-shifted gears will not mesh correctly with regular ones - the mating gear always needs to have exactly the opposite shift. This is seldom a problem, but you need to keep this constraint in mind. 6.2.5. Putting it all together All right! Equipped with all this knowledge, you can compute the profile for your first set of involute gears. There are many different approaches to this task, but my favorite method is unique in that it comes without the limitations that plague simpler techniques - and if you are so inclined, it can be easily generalized to deal with a variety of unusual gear shapes and tooth profiles later on. The process begins with calculating the circumference of the pitch circle for your gear: cpitch = tooth_width * 2 * tooth_count. From this, you can trivially calculate its diameter of the circle you need to draw (c / π). Once you have it on your screen, you need to add a straight line tangent to the pitch circle; this will be used to build a hypothetical mating gear with an infinite diameter. If we can mesh with this, we will be also able to mesh with any smaller gears encountered in real life. On this "pitch line" of our infinite gear, we can draw two lines perpendicular to it, precisely tooth_width apart - and rotate them around the point where they intersect the infinite gear by an amount corresponding to the pressure angle we want to maintain (18° in this example). To turn this into a proper tooth, we need to add a horizontal line that is normally placed addendum = tooth_width * 2 / π below; in fact, draw the line about 5% farther down to create some clearance for any dirt or grease caught in between gears. When done, trim off the excess - and voila: The next step is to simply perform a simulation of how this tooth would engage and then disengage with the actual gear we are trying to create. Recall the mention of rubber rollers: for any two meshing gears, the linear velocity at the pitch circle should be the same - so if the infinite gear (aka rack) moves by n millimeters, the other gear will rotate by 360° / cpitch * n. The rest should be fairly obvious; this is the pattern you will see if you keep creating copies of the tooth at successive offsets along the rack, and then rotating them back by a matching angle around the center of the pitch circle of our gear: The process can be automated easily in almost every CAD tool, although for the initial try, it makes sense to do it by hand; in any case, once you have this pattern generated, you simply need to trace a curve around it, replicate this curve using the polar array tool to create the preselected number of teeth, and offset the pitch circle by the addendum distance to trim off the unnecessary bits: Try to do this exercise on your own. With rare exceptions where backlash is completely unacceptable, you should draw the outline about 0.05 mm apart from the trace left behind by the simulation; without this small amount of play, the teeth will engage on both sides simultaneously, producing unnecessary friction. 6.2.6. Bonus tricks The beauty of the simulation-based method of constructing gears is that it's WYSIWYG, and that it takes most of the usual constraints out of the equation: for example, you can produce gears with any number of teeth, because the possibilty of undercuts is automatically accounted for. On top of that, it can be modified in several fairly intuitive ways. You can: Use custom tooth profiles: instead of the trapezoidal tooth profile we created in our example, you can as well draw a puppy, and still get a pair of working, matching gears. It won't be particularly efficient, but it will work. I'm not good with puppies, but here's an example of a less cute freeform tooth and its generated counterpart: More practically, you can also design gears that have an involute profile, but mesh only with a particular matching gear, by using that gear's tooth profile and its pitch circle, as opposed to a rack. This will help you reduce undercuts when other methods fail. Create custom gear shapes: there is nothing that forces you to perform the simulation against a pitch circle - the algorithm can be easily extended to use an arbitrary "pitch curve" to generate oddball gears that produce variable transmission ratios and do other funny things. Draw internal gears: "inverted" gears - essentially a ring with teeth pointing to the inside - are indispensable in certain types of mechanisms, including high-performance transmissions covered in section 6.4. These need to be generated to mesh with a specific gear running on the inside, using its tooth profile, and are tough to get right by other means. Sounds more fun than it should be? You bet it does! Tip: of course, there is no need to repeat all these steps by hand. The most flexible option is this web-based generator developed by Rainer Hessmer. The tool is very user-friendly: simply enter several parameters and get a DXF file in return. The tool properly handles undercuts, internal gears, profile shifts, and so on - so take it for a spin! If you're using Rhino, you may also enjoy my experimental Grasshopper module, which provides a comparable degree of flexibility, but is much faster, with instant feedback right within the CAD environment. It comes with fairly detailed instructions and features important for machineability, too. To run the add-on, you will need to install the Grasshopper plugin itself, open the plugin with the namesake command, and then load the gear_calc.gh file into the app. Note that the internal gear functionality is not fully operational yet: undercuts are not properly compensated for if the diameter of the meshing gear is close to that of the internal one. Last but not least, some Rhino users may want to grab a copy of my earlier semi-automatic script. Its main advantage is that it can handle arbitrary tooth profiles and very accurately handle internal gears. It is activated by entering Hob4 in the command prompt and answering some simple questions about the gear you want to generate. It will then draw the appropriate circles and - if instructed to do - a standard trapezoidal tooth profile. You can modify the profile or simply select the one produced by the script, and run Hob4 again to finish the job. As noted, the script also allows you to generate internal gears; to do that, you must provide a mating pitch circle and tooth profile extracted from a previously generated external gear. This circle needs to inside, and must be touching the top of the pitch circle for the internal gear. 6.3. Other types of gears Involute spur gears are remarkably versatile, easy to model, and easy to manufacture - but they are certainly not the only type of a gear you can use. Let's go over some of the more exotic but still useful options that may come handy in your work. 6.3.1. Bevel gears In comparison to planar spur gears, bevel gears have a very important property: they mesh at an angle, and therefore, can be used to change the axis of rotation. Although this goal can be achieved by other means - for example, with simplified crown gears or with worm drive, bevel gears do so with remarkable precision and efficiency. The process of constructing a set of meshing bevel gears is considerably more complicated than what we discussed before, and involves a brush with non-Euclidean spaces; nevertheless, if you follow these instructions closely, you should be able to pull it off. As with spur gears, the first step is to choose tooth counts, width, height, and pressure angles; you should also think about the exact gear ratio you want to achieve, as one pair of gears will be not interoperable with any other differently configured set. Next, draw the appropriate pitch circles for both of the gears you want to create, placing them on the X-Y plane; when done, add two lines perpendicular to this plane and going through the center of each circle. Finally, rotate one of the circles (and the associated perpendicular line) in the Y-Z plane, pivoting the operation around the point where touches the other one. In our example, we will use 90° between the mating gears, but any other angle is a possibility: With this out of the way, draw a line that starts where the two perpendicular lines meet each other, and ends where the two circles touch each other (Q). Next, using the Y-Z drawing plane, add a line perpendicular to this newly created one. This final line is denoted as l: To minimize clutter, we'll focus on constructing the gear profile for circle a, and hide the other circle for time being; the steps needed to construct a suitable gear profile for the second gear will be analogous to what we are doing past this point, so you should have no difficulty figuring it out. The next task is to mark two locations on the line l that are in equal distance from point Q; these newly created locations are denoted as C and D. The distance must be a bit greater than the addendum for your gears, but beyond that, the exact value doesn't matter. With these two points in place, draw a circle in the X-Y plane that has the same center as circle a, and passes through point C; a similar circle should be drawn for D. Lastly, use the loft operator after selecting the newly created circles c and d to build a conical surface: The next challenge is to check the manual for your CAD application, and identify an operator that allows you to "unroll" this surface to a construction plane; in Rhino, UnrollSrf is what you need. Select the surface and the original circle a, and apply this transformation; you should get an object resembling the one on the left: Extract the two "broken" edges of the surface as straight curves, and draw a circle that has the same center and diameter as the arc produced by unrolling the curve we selected alongside with the cone. This will be your virtual pitch circle, on which you will have to construct a regular tooth profile using the approach outlined earlier on. You can start by simulating the appropriate tooth profile (center, above), and then by making a planar array to complete the gear (right). The only difference is that before making the array, you need to rotate the profile by 90° to touch one of the extracted edges; and then make a radial array consisting of tooth_count copies that fill an angle of 360° / length_of_virtual_pitch_circle * length_of_circle_a, rather than the usual 360°. When done, truncate the parts that stick outside the edges, and you should be all set. To wrap up this process, you need to position the created gear profile over the unrolled surface again, making sure that it is aligned correctly. Next, use an operator that will map the curve back onto the original conical surface, using the unrolled geometry as a reference. In Rhino, this is accomplished with FlowAlongSrf. Just make sure that you select matching locations on the reference and destination surface, and if you did it right, you should be able to get something of this sort: You can delete the cone and all the helper surfaces at this point, and repeat the same procedure to generate the other gear. In the end, you should be seeing a result that resembles this: Neat, eh? You can now create a scaled copy of each outline along the appropriate axis, using a 3D scaling operator with the origin set at the point where the axes intersect; be careful with this step, as using an incorrect origin will result in gears that would not mesh. With this step out of the way, the scaled copy and the original can be then lofted together, and each of them can be individually extruded toward any point behind the gear to create a cap surface. A few extra moves to trim and cap everything neatly, and you should have a final result in front of you: Sweet! 6.3.2. Worm gears Worm gears are an interesting animal. On one hand, they offer extremely high reduction ratios, which makes them quite attractive for robotics: every turn of the input shaft advances the output gear just by a single tooth. On the other hand, they generally boast very poor efficiency due to significant friction - 30-40% being the norm. From the design standpoint, these gears are fairly unremarkable; the output gear is generated the same way you would make any other spur gear, while the input gear - or more accurately, the input screw - is essentially a rack tooth that is wrapped around a spiral path, with a tooth_width * 2 pitch between the turns: Depending on the thickness of the output gear and the diameter of the input screw, the profile used to generate the output gear may need to be corrected slightly, based on a 2D projection of the trimmed, meshing section of the screw. You should be able to create all this with no help by now; operators such as Sweep1 and Silhouette in Rino are about everything you need. The only complication for CNC machining is that as opposed to spur and bevel gears, the input screw needs a two-part mold. 6.3.3. Helical gears Helical gears are essentialy spur gears - but (literally!) with a twist. Instead of having their teeth extruded along the axis of rotation, the top and bottom profiles are rotated in relation to each other, and then lofted to form a twisted gear. The twisting may be done in a straight line (left) or in a curved fashion (center): The point of this modification is that each gear will now engage more gradually, thus reducing the amount of noise and vibration produced under load, this matters particularly in automotive applications and other situations where steel gears transfer high torques at high speeds. On the flip side, this geometry means that the gears act like a wedge, and exert substantial axial forces on the assembly they are coupled to; a double helical layout, also known as herringbone (above, right) works around that to a large extent. Helical gears are relatively difficult to make using simple, CNC-machined molds; for optimal results, the mold would need to be split into four to six parts. It is easier to machine them directly using a rotary axis - but in any case, the benefits of using this class of gears are negligible in small-scale robotics work. 6.3.4. Pulleys for timing belts Gears that mesh with timing belts are constructed in a manner fairly similar to a normal gear meshing with a rack, but their shape is not entirely symmetrical. MXL timing belts use 40° teeth with a pitch of 2.03 mm. Addendum of the timing belt is approximately 0.5 mm; the dedendum is zero. The width of base of the tooth (at the pitch circle / line of the belt) is around 1.2 mm, leaving just around 0.8 mm in between the teeth. The solid section above the gears is usually around 0.7 mm thick. Of course, the belts are made of rubber and will easily conform to pulleys even if the dimensions are slightly off - so you don't need to obsess over it as much as you'd have to with rigid gears. 6.4. Getting started with gearboxes It is possible to adjust the speed or torque of a motor by employing just a single pair of gears, but doing so is often impractical: for example, if you have a motor that nominally runs at 10,000 RPM, and want to get down to 100 RPM - a reduction of 100:1 - you would need to mesh an input gear with about 10 teeth to an output gear with no fewer than 1,000. Assuming that the width of a single tooth is 0.6 mm, the diameter of the latter gear would be almost 50 cm - oops! To solve this problem, it is common to build gearboxes that employ multiple stages; each stage reduces the speed by a more reasonable factor - usually between 2:1 and 5:1 - and then powers the next stage that performs the same trick again. The gains are exponential: if one stage gives us 4:1, then two will offer a 16:1 reduction; three will yield 64:1; and four would get us down to 256:1. The most rudimentary type of a gearbox is the offset-gear arrangement shown on the left; you can check out a practical example of this design here. This approach works well, but tends to take up space; a simple modification, shown on the right, is to stack the gears alternating between two shared axles, instead (example): Offset gear transmissions of this sort are simple and adequate for most needs; for instance, Tinybot mk III uses them exclusively. Having said that, every now and then, you may wish for something more compact and self-contained. If you are pressed for space, it makes sense to consider a planetary gearbox. There are several possible ways to design such a mechanism, but the most practical arrangement relies on a small, centrally placed sun gear coupled with the input shaft; that gear is surrounded by several planets, and these planet gears in turn roll inside a stationary internal gear known as annulus or ring: Of course, this design makes little or no sense if the planets just run freely; the output stage is created by creating a carriage that slides onto the planet gears, often using a sleeve bearing. The transmission ratio of such a mechanism will be tooth_cntsun / tooth_cntannulus - and that's quite a good result in such a small envelope. Just as importantly, additional stages of a planetary gearbox can be packed tightly on top of each other, resulting in a form factor that is pretty hard to beat. To better illustrate the practical aspects of making a planetary gearbox, you may want to check out this rendering of the design I have been using in my projects for quite a little while: Of course, planetary gearboxes are no silver bullet; they are about 2-3 times more compact than offset gears, and outperform them in some ways, but it's possible to run into situations where an even higher ratio would be desirable - but where the poor efficiency of worm gears and other types of screw-based actuators is hard to swallow. Of all the more exotic transmission systems, the most promising one is probably the cycloidal drive. This device easily attains ratios of 100:1 or more in a single stage by brilliantly exploiting eccentric motion of a large gear in a comparably-sized "cage": I have a separate page describing this particular design in more detail, so I won't repeat all the information here. Rest assured, cycloidal drive systems have some substantial downsides - for example, they tend to introduce vibration, and require subminiature ball bearings to isolate the input shaft from the eccentric gear. Nevertheless, when out of mainstream options, they are worth a try. 6.5. Overview of drive systems By now, you should be well-equipped to get ahead with almost any electromechanical project you can think of; the only question is where to start. In the world of robotics, the single most important choice is probably the mode of locomotion; everything else - from the selection of sensors, to power sources, to data processing capabilities - follows from that. In the last section of this chapter, it makes sense to quickly run through the options you have. In all likelihood, your initial projects should probably be wheeled. It is tempting to try something bolder, but until you are familiar with the dynamic properties of plastics, and have several precision robots under your belt, it's really the best choice. Some of the common approaches to wheeled robots include: Differential steering: in this design, the two front wheels are individually hooked up to two motors; the rear wheels are typically spinning freely. When the motors are rotating at the same speed, the robot drives in a straight line; speed differences result in the chassis banking to the left or to the right. The rear wheels typically need to be equipped with rotary encoders or optointerrupters to detect and compensate for unintented fluctuations in motor speed, and to sense loss of traction. The main disadvantage of this design is that during sharp turns, the non-powered wheels will be dragged sideways, which may lead to loss of registration with the environment. The problem can be avoided by using swivel wheels - or even eliminating the rear wheels completely and lowering the center of mass so that the device is stable with just two; but all these solutions make it much harder to maintain a robust feedback loop. That last problem may be overcome by using Mecanum wheels - but the price tag may be hard to swallow. Car-style steering: in this arrangement, the front wheels are spinning freely; a rigid linkage operated by a motor allows them to turned left and right while a separate motor powers the rear wheels. Position sensors places on the front wheels provide a feedback loop. This is the arrangement used in Tinybot mk III. The approach is simple and sweet, which is precisely why it's so popular in the real world. That said, not all is roses: for accurate, slip-free turns, you may still have to incorporate Ackermann linkages and a differential on the rear axle. This adds more complexity than you could be expecting. Fully reorientable drivetrain: this approach relies on a drivetrain with a system of linkages that allows every wheel to be repositioned to accommodate motion in a particular direction. A simple and economical design of this type, using only three motors and permitting on-the-spot 360° turns, is employed in my Omnibot. The only disadvantage of the specific approach used in Omnibot is that the robot needs to come to a stop before changing direction. In situations where this is a significant problem, additional motors may be used to independently control the position of each wheel. Wheeled robots aside, legged creatures have some undeniable appeal. These robot designs tend to pose a range of challenges related to space management, torque requirements, obstacle sensing, and the creation of practical movement algorithms. Sure - it is relatively easy to bolt a bunch of expensive servos on top of a simple frame - but going beyond that point is usually fraught with peril. Still, if you want to give it a try, your basic choices are: Biped locomotion: achieving a natural, stable, and useful walking gait probably requires at least 4-5 degrees of freedom per leg, packed in a very narrow envelope - as well as a bunch of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and contact or current sensors to detect problems while it's still possible to recover. Because of this, and because of the algorithmic complexity of dynamically stable biped motion, most of the designs you can see tend to cut a lot of corners; using oversized feet to achieve static stability, or executing turns in a large number of small and awkward movements, is a common pattern. Quadruped and beyond: with four or more legs, it is relatively easy to create a design capable of moving in any direction without the need for sophisticated stability control. At least three degrees of freedom per leg are probably required to achieve efficient walking gaits (making turns, climbing obstacles, etc), but some success on flat surfaces can be achieved with only two degrees. Hexapods seem to be particularly popular with hobbyists - perhaps because of their sinister look? Of course, a number of designs for "scuttling" robots with one or less than one degree for freedom per leg can be found on the Internet - but they are usually not any more practical than a wind-up toy. These movement modes aside, there is a long tail of exotic inventions that are worth at least reading about. We have hopping pogo stick robots; several well-publicized ball-balancing units; a bunch of levitating designs that leverage air cushions, magnetic fields, or vibration; insanely cool crawling robots; and a large selection of flying and sailing ones. And hey - why not add something of your own to that list? 7. Workshop safety topics We're done with the technical stuff, but stay with me for a bit longer: even for DIYers, workplace safety is no laughing matter. You will be dealing with power tools and reactive chemicals, and so if you want to pursue this hobby, there are inherent risks you simply have to understand and accept. It's entirely possible to lose an eye or set your house on fire; there are certain common-sense steps you can take to minimize the probability of mishaps, but the odds will never go down to zero. It is also your sole responsibility to investigate and follow all the applicable HOA rules, city ordinances, and other regulations - especially as they relate to purchasing laboratory supplies and chemicals, the use of power tools, and the disposal of unreacted chemicals. In many places, the laws are sensible or non-existent; but exceptions happen. If you accidentally ignore a piece of obscure, boneheaded legislation - well, nine out of ten times, nobody will know or care, but do you really want to be that one unlucky guy? OK. With all that in mind, this chapter provides a quick but non-authoritative overview of some of the most obvious safety considerations and health risks for CNC machining and resin casting. There are no guarantees that this information is accurate, complete, or up-to-date, so do your own research. Do not blindly trust one random dude on the Internet! 7.1. Working around milling machines Small CNC mills are fairly safe, compared to most other power tools - but you still need to read and follow the instruction manual, and in general, exercise common sense in everything you do. The primary risks are getting your hand pinched between the rotating tool and the workpiece, or between any other moving parts; having loose clothing or hair caught by the spindle; or being hit by any debris ejected during the cutting process. Becaue of this, you should really stay clear of the machine while it's running a job - after all, you have no business fiddling with it. If you really need to make some sort of an adjustment, or perhaps simply vacuum off accumulated shavings, it's imperative to pause the cutting process first. It is also a very good idea to wear basic eye protection at all times; although the odds of a broken tool or other sharp material hitting your eye are very low, the damage can be significant. All that aside, high-speed CNC lathes and high-power CNC mills (over 1 kW or so) have their own safety rules that I will not cover here. These devices are often powerful enough to break bones, sever limbs, or eject a loose workpiece with a speed sufficient to kill or maim. If you have one of these, the use of robust safety covers made out of sheet metal, polycarbonate, or wood, is definitely a must. 7.2. Dust considerations Any type of dust can aggravate existing respiratory conditions; prolonged and heavy exposure may also lead to the development of brand new ones. That said, most of the noteworthy CNC stock materials give off relatively little airborne particles when machined in a sensible way - and so, your overall exposure to nuisance dust will probably not change in a major way. Lifelong exposures to wood dust are associated with nasal cancer, so reasonable dust management is advisable for wood-related projects. When working with prototyping boards such as RenShape 460, airborne dust is produced in modest quantities and has no known, specific health risks, but it's still probably good to keep it in check. Covering the mill with plastic sheeting for the duration of the job (well clear of any rotating parts and inlet vents) is a simple dust management trick; building or buying a proper enclosure is an option, too. When containment is impractical, a simple N95 particulate respirator (link) should offer protection. Of course, there are materials that pose an elevated risk; to avoid really unpleasant surprises, always investigate the substances you are milling, sanding, or otherwise dispersing in the air. You should be particularly wary of anything that contains crystalline silica (quartz), asbestos, elemental metals, toxic pigments, and any other harmful substances that may be absorbed through the lungs. Note: whie crystalline silica (quartz) is a significant danger when inhaled, there is no compelling evidence that amorphous glass products, such as milled glass fibers or 3M glass microspheres, share the same risk. You still don't want to breathe any of that stuff in, but these fillers should be safe to use in their intended way - and a tiny amount of dust should be OK. 7.3. Vacuum and high pressure Vacuum isn't particularly dangerous to work with, but you should be aware of the risk of implosion. Plastic vacuum chambers should be inspected for cracking or crazing, and should never be exposed to high temperatures, substantial quantities of solvents, strong acids and bases, and so on. Sketchy-looking or homebrew chambers can be secured with packing tape, shrink-wrap foil, fabric, and similar materials that will retain debris if things go wrong. Other than that, you have very little to worry about; oh, if you are working in a confined space, it may make sense to vent the vacuum pump to the outside, so that the relatively small quantities of gases liberated from the resin - as well as the fine mist of mineral oil from the pump itself - don't end up right under your nose. Pressure casting is more dangerous; that's in part because the pressure differentials are much higher than for vacuum casting (especially if something goes wrong), and because all the energy is released outward if the container fails. Because of this, you should never try to rig your own pressure chambers or any other parts of the system, and not even think about removing any safety valves, regulators, and so on. Follow the instructions religiously, especially when it comes to draining the compressor; do not exceed manufacturer-provided pressure ratings; always double-check that the system is depressurized before trying to open the chamber; and disconnect everything completely when not in use. With common-sense precautions, catastrophic failure is unlikely - but rest assured, bad things have happened to quite a few people who should have known better. Oh, one more thing: if you are inclined to get a nitrogen tank for blanketing resin containers in storage, go for a small one - capacity of 1 cubic meter (40 cubic ft) is more than enough. Store it horizontally or attach it to the wall to make sure it can't fall over, and always use a regulator. 7.4. Silicone resins Platinum cure silicones are believed to be essentially harmless; both the siloxane resin and the catalyst are non-reactive and show virtually no toxicity in animal studies. You should always read material safety datasheets for the specific product you are using, but chances are, the only risk you have to worry about is that the material is sticky, and spills can be annoying to clean up (naphtha and other nonpolar solvents can help). Beyond basic workplace hygiene, no special precautions should be necessary. Now, I don't recommend using condensation cure silicones, but if you decided to choose that option, you should be aware that they often use a small amount of dibutyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin dineodecanoate, or a similar tin(IV) compound, to catalyze the reaction. The substance is corrosive, and more troublingly, exhibits some chronic toxicity. It is present at around 5% in the catalyst component, and usually at less than 1% in the finished product - but since it will leach out in favorable conditions, you should probably not be using condensation cure silicones to make anything that is routinely worn or handled by humans, or that comes into contact with food. When mixing these resins, it's best to use latex or vinyl gloves; basic eye protection is not a bad idea, too. Storing the catalyst in a suitable cabinet and out of reach of children is important, too. 7.5. Polyurethanes Polyurethane resins consist of several very distinctive components, and it's probably useful to discuss them separately. Here's what you can typically find in the MSDS: Isocyanates: polyurethane formulations used for prototyping normally rely on fairly non-volatile isocyanates, such as liquefied methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), hydrogenated MDI (HMDI / DMDI), or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI); products where these isocyanates are already partly polymerized are common, and in this case, the prepolymer may be not listed in the MSDS at all. In general, all these substances are fairly reactive, can be damaging to mucous membranes, and upon longer exposures, will irritate skin. Fortunately, they polymerize to form an inert substance soon after being exposed to water, alcohols, and many other common substances - so they pose little danger to the environment, and do not bioaccumulate. Isocyanates tend to be pretty dangerous if inhaled - enough to earn some of the water-clear HMDI and IPDI formulations a nice "toxic" label in Canada and in the EU. Nevertheless, the extremely low vapor pressure of these chemicals - around one million times lower than water - means that if you are using them for casting reasonably sized parts at room temperature, you have very little to worry about. Within the scope of this guide, the main things to avoid is getting the substance into your eyes and spilling it in large quantities. Use eye protection, wear latex or vinyl gloves, and keep your workplace safe and clutter-free. Now, as hinted earlier, several manufacturers resort to more reactive and more volatile isocyanates, such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI); I recommend avoiding these, but if you have no choice, really good ventilation, gloves, and safety glasses are absolutely a must. Note: a small proportion of industry workers frequently exposed to significant concentrations of isocyanates eventually develop hypersensitivity to the compound. Although this is very unlikely to happen when working with room temperature casting formulations, you should obviously seek medical attention if you have difficulty breathing within several hours of working with this or any other exotic chemical. Polyols / polyetheramines: most polyester or polyether polyol compositions are viscous, non-reactive, non-volatile fluids with relatively high molecular weight, chemically related to substances such as propylene glycol, glycerine, xylitol, and so on. They tend to have rather low toxicity in their intended use, and aren't particularly reactive. Not all products are the same - but unless something stands out in the MSDS, you probably don't have to worry (of course, common sense still applies). Some systems may also use lower molecular weight amines as crosslinkers, or higher molecular weight polyetheramines to replace traditional polyols. Low molecular weight amines tend to be a bit more biologically active and irritating; a chlorine-containing amine originally used in many polyurethane formulations - 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) - was found to be a probable human carcinogen. A number of less reactive replacements emerged since then, and are expected to be much safer based on their chemical structure and animal data. In other words, there is no reason to panic, but it definitely makes sense to handle the formulations with some respect. A good sign of high amine content is a yellow-to-caramel color of the polyol component, alongside with a slight but disagreeable smell. Catalysts: these substances are of special interest, because as opposed to the core reagents outlined above, they usually remain as-is in the cured product - and if the circumstances are right, may leach out of it in small quantities, particularly out of Shore A elastomers. Modern polyurethane chemistry is usually catalyzed with much less than 1% of a carboxylate of bismuth, zinc, tin(II), or a related metal; or with a handful of reasonably selective amines, imidazoles, and so on. Most of the contemporary metal-based catalysts are extremely unlikely to be of any concern - especially at the concentrations used in the resin. The non-metal catalysts have also been studied extensively and carry no known risks at these levels - but as noted earlier, they belong to large and interesting families of bioactive compounds. As a relic of bygone days, several manufacturers still resort to toxic or bioaccumulative organometal catalysts, such as mercury neodecanoate or dibutyltin dilaurate; for example, that's the case for many products from Smooth-On and Freeman. In theory, the cured plastic should be safe to handle under normal circumstances. In practice, the mobility of the organomercury compound may be increased by factors such as incorrect mixing proprtions, UV degradation, exposure to elevated temperatures, or the action of solvents and household chemicals. In the end, I certainly wouldn't use the latter class of resins for jewelry, toys, or food applications - and I wouldn't want to worry about the exposure due to spills and other workshop accidents. I generally recommend staying away from such products altogether, especially since the alternatives have gotten much better over the years. It's not that mercury-catalyzed products are likely to maim you, but they introduce a small, preventable, incremental health risk. When in doubt about the catalyst used, simply check the MSDS to confirm. Note: if you are purchasing any concentrated catalysts or inhibitors to modify the performance of your resins (as discussed in section 4.4.4), be sure to do your homework. For example, common bismuth, zinc, and tin(II) carboxylates are believed to have very modest acute toxicity and no major chronic risks. Many other organometal catalysts - for example, based on tin(IV), cobalt, or mercury - are something you really don't want to keep around in concentrated form. Triethylenediamine and its friends sit somewhere in between: they are flammable, irritating, and fairly reactive, but probably not particularly toxic per se. Plasticizers, fillers, surfactants, etc: while most resins don't contain many other questionable additives, it's useful to briefly scan the MSDS for anything else out of the ordinary. For example, several manufacturers add phthalate plasticizers - such as butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) or dibutyl phthalate (DBP) - to some of the more flexible polyurethane rubber formulations. While these substances have very low acute toxicity and were not shown to be conclusively harmful to humans, animal studies raise some worries about long-term subchronic exposure through children toys, food-contact items, and so on - a situation vaguely reminiscent of the controvery around bisphenol A (BPA). No need to panic, but educate yourself and decide what's your tolerance for such peripheral risks. Residual solvents: some resins may contain small quantities of solvents that are left over from the manufacturing process or have been intentionally added to help with mixing or degassing. This may include xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, etc. Although the solvents are harmful upon prolonged, heavy exposure, the amounts present in the material are usually tiny (under 0.5%) and probably do not pose any serious concern. As with any chemicals, you should avoid mixing polyurethanes - and isocyanates in particular - with potentially incompatible substances; as hinted earlier, this includes alcohols, water, but also strong bases, oxidizers, amines, and metal salts. Rapid polymerization, decomposition, or other funny developments may ensue. Isocyanates also decompose in a matter of minutes in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), so do not use this solvent as a carrier for dyes, catalysts, and so forth. In the same vein, don't mix unreasonable quantities of polyurethane resins in a single batch. Runaway exothermic reactions can become dangerous if the resin gets so hot that the mixing container melts away, or something catches fire. If you need to dispose of a large quantity of unwanted resin, polymerize it in batches; or at the very least, use a large, shallow pan and work outdoors, away from other humans and flammable stuff. Last but not least, because of their irritant properties, uncured resins should be stored safely, and kept out of reach of children and other creatures other than the intended user. These considerations aside, cured polyurethanes are one of the safer, more stable, and least controversial plastics out there. Even if you mess up the mixing ratio, the unreacted isocyanates will simply eventually react with moisture, unreacted polyols will not pose a threat, and nothing horribly bad should be leaching out of the material otherwise. Like most plastics, and organic materials in general, polyurethanes release a fair amount of toxic substances during thermal decomposition - carbon monoxide being by far the most significant problem - so try to resist the urge to burn them if at all possible. 7.6. Other chemicals Throughout this guide, I have mentioned quite a few chemicals that won't be covered in this chapter in special detail. If you plan on getting any of them, you should take care to obtain and read the appropriate material safety datasheets, and understand all the associated risks. In no particular order, here are some of the things you should know: Epoxy resins: many of these products use corrosive and somewhat volatile compounds. Chronic toxicity may be a concern with daily exposure. When mixing larger quantities, beware of significant exotherm - it's usually more pronounced than in polyurethanes. Polyester resins: styrene is highly volatile and flammable, and its vapors are harmful. On top of that, the standard catalyst is a strong oxidizer, and the resin typically cures with an extremely pronounced exotherm. Pigments and dyes: toxic pigments based on lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel are available on the market, but should be avoided. Shop specifically for modern, less harmful alternatives. Avoid pigments that contain crystalline silica of respirable size - and in any case, handle the material with care. Glass fibers: thin strands of glass are easily embedded in the skin, and can give you an annoying but generally harmless rash that takes 2-3 days to go away; getting the material into eyes can be a more serious issue, so use gloves, clean up promptly, and don't touch your face until then. If you get a rash, scratching it will usually only push the fibers deeper; soaking the affected area in water and applying an over-the-counter anti-itch cream (antihistamine) will offer relief. Common solvents, glues, demolding agents: unless indicated otherwise, you should assume that all these products are extremely flammable and that their vapors are harmful. Prolonged exposure to very high levels of certain solvents may lead to CNS effects, reproductive toxicity, and so on; over time, lasting damage is a possibility, too. Naphtha, xylene, toluene, benzene, methylene chloride, and NMP are of special concern. All the other stuff: several substances mentioned in this guide may be described as "reasonably safe", but that doesn't necessarily mean they are non-toxic if aerosolized or ingested in significant quantities; that they don't react in funny ways with incompatible materials; or that they won't cause damage if rubbed into your eyes or skin, heated up, or mishandled in some other way. Before buying any chemicals on eBay, Amazon, or anywhere else, look up their safety datasheets first. Tip: MSDSes are targeted at industrial uses, and err heavily on the side of caution; the datasheet for table salt says that the substance is "harmful in case of ingestion"; that skin contaminated with it must be flushed with water for "at least 15 minutes"; that protective clothing and gloves should be worn at all times; and that proper ventilation is necessary. They also warn that you shouldn't let this chemical enter the environment. And that's not even the worst example: Sigma-Aldrich has a serious datasheet for pure water that says you should use proper glove removal techniques and... wash hands after handling this dastardly chemical. To fend off lawsuits, they also make sure to mention that the chemical, physical, and toxicological properties of this material have not been thoroughly investigated. Do not ignore the advice provided in these documents, but use common sense when evaluating your personal risk, and the safety measures that are appropriate given the amounts you are working with, the way you are handling the substance, the frequency of exposure, and so on. It's always good to pay close attention to LD50 values; chronic health risks; and any mentions of carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity, etc. It hopefully goes without saying that you should store all the materials discussed in this guide away from sources of ignition, excessive heat, and so on; that you need to keep them away from children; and that if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should avoid any non-essential exposure to exotic, industrial chemicals - no matter what the MSDS says. 8. Closing notes Well, that's it! I'm hoping that the content included here inspired you to some extent, or helped you solve a specific problem or two. Since this guide is incredibly niche, if you made it this far, your feedback would be greatly appreciated. If you are so inclined, drop me a mail at lcamtuf@coredump.cx. In any case, good luck in your future work! Your lucky number: 24340256 What to buy: If you can get ER or a similar collet-based system, go for it. Otherwise, just make sure that the toolholding system is versatile enough to accommodate common shank sizes (3, 4, and 6 mm for metric cutters; 1/8" and 1/4" for imperial system tools), and will be sufficiently precise for your needs. Manually programming your CNC machine is about as much fun as building a steamboat out of toothpicks. For a higher-level approach, you need to turn to CAM software: it automatically analyzes the provided geometry (created with any 3D modelling application) and converts it to a set of paths that need to be retraced by the tool to approximate the desired shape. Once these toolpaths are ready, the software then breaks them down into a sequence of painfully basic instructions that actually make sense to the controller embedded in the mill; say, "set speed to 12,000 RPM" or "move cutter to X = 10.245, Y = 5.000, Z = -2.000". The toolpath generation stage is largely hardware-agnostic; but the program generation one isn't. It's good to shop for a machine that speaks a common and well-documented language - or, lacking this, is popular enough to be supported by some of the best-known CAM apps. Keep in mind that even if the manufacturer bundles the mill with some starter software, you don't want to be left out in the cold if the application one day refuses to work with your new PC - or if it simply turns out to be of poor quality. The most common quasi-standard language used by almost all CNC mills is called G-code (aka "NC"). Calling it a real standard may be a stretch: there are very significant variations in how the syntax is implemented by the manufacturers. Still, having support for G-code spells rudimentary compatibility, or at least easy integration, with almost any CAM application on the market. For other languages, this is not always given. What to buy: check if the mill is supported by common third-party packages (Deskproto, VisualMILL, madCAM, MeshCAM, Mayka, etc); if it's not, and if it speaks something else than a clearly documented variant of G-code, be wary. We're almost done: the last thing to do is a quick reality check. Benchtop mills span from units no larger than an inkjet printer, to ones weighing in excess of 200 kg and taking up almost 1 x 1 m of desk space. When shopping for the larger models, be sure to account for their physical characteristics, and make sure you have a way to get them in your workshop to begin with (some doors are barely 70 cm wide). For heavier mills, it is also important to have a piece of sturdy furniture; it's not just the static load that you have to worry about, as the machine may also produce horizontal shear forces due to acceleration and deceleration of the cutting head. Not every wobbly desk from Ikea can handle that - but any proper workbench should. Benchtop mills usually run on standard, single-phase 110 / 230 VAC power supply, but of course, make sure to double-check. They may require several amps in peak, so you don't want them to share a single circuit with a vacuum cleaner, an electric kettle, or a space heater - especially in an older home. Okay - that sums up the list of parameters that are worth looking at. There are also some characteristics that sound important, but usually aren't - so to help you decide, here's a quick list to consult when in doubt: Positioning accuracy: this value tells you how true the machine's idea of a millimeter is to a calibrated reference. The difference is usually negligible, and even if it wasn't, you can compensate in software without any special effort. Origin reproducibility: this indicates how good the machine is about resuming the same starting location after being power cycled. Not particularly important in normal work, unless your power goes out in the middle of a cutting job. Software resolution: unlikely to be lower than mechanical resolution, and fairly meaningless if it's higher. Motor power: spindle motors delivering as little as 75-100 W should be perfectly sufficient for the processes advocated in this guide. More powerful mills are beneficial chiefly in heavy-duty metal work. Table size: easy to confuse with the actual machinable area, but nowhere near as important. The difference between a 2 cm margin and a 10 cm one usually doesn't matter at all. List of millable materials: every mill should be able to cope with a wide variety of materials; don't read too much into the list provided by the manufacturer. Tool changer (ATC): it's a convenient device for unattended jobs, but it's usually not worth the expense in hobby work. It's nice, but unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket, you can do without it. Contact scanner accessory: contact scanning heads are a gadget available for some CNC mills, but chances are, you will use them to scan a couple of coins or pendants, and then lose all interest. For reverse engineering of mecanical designs, just using a caliper works a lot better, and takes less time. Noise ratings: probably not what you think. These parameters describe the noise produced by the mill when in standby mode (spindle off); or when operating, but not making contact with a workpiece. Benchtop mills are fairly quiet in no-load conditions; and even the most compact and underpowered devices can be pretty loud when actually machining something. The actual noise level will range from barely perceptible when working in waxes or using sub-mm cutters, to pretty unpleasant when rapidly plowing through metal with a large-diameter tool. In fact, just imagine the noise made by a saw or a drill. Well, that's probably it. If you spot any other puzzling parameters, please let me know. That really depends on your budget and the scale of the projects you want to be working on. The manufacturers listed 2.1 are a starting point, but the market is evolving rapidly; I had some specific recommendations listed here in the initial version of the guide, but within two years, most of them were out of date. My best advice is to run some Google searches; if in doubt, check out forums such as /r/hobbycnc on Reddit, or simply drop me a mail. Ordering a CNC machine? Well, the next stop is getting some cutters. The selection available on the market is quite overwhelming, so to save you time and money, let's talk about some of the properties that set these tools apart. Oh, before we dive in... here's a drawing of a typical end mill, and all the lingo you will have to memorize soon: All right - so here are the differences you will see: Material: end mills are made either out of cobalt steel alloys (known as high speed steel, or HSS), or from tungsten carbide in a cobalt lattice (colloquially shortened to "carbide"). The latter option is considerably harder, more rigid, and more wear-resistant - and for the tool sizes we are interested in, carries a relatively small premium (30% or so). What to buy: Stick to carbide. Coatings: carbide cutters may be further coated with ceramics such as titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN, aka AlTiN), titanium nitride (TiN), titanium carbon nitride (TiCN), or with amorphous or crystalline diamond. The coatings tend to improve hardness or reduce friction; the bluish-gray TiAlN coating is probably the most common one. In non-abrasive plastics, this particular coating doesn't have a very pronounced effect, but it extends tool life by some 20% or so - and the cost is only 10% extra, so it's not a bad deal. Of course, in some situations, tool wear is a more pronounced concern; for example, glass or carbon fiber composites can leave a mark on carbide tools in a matter of hours. In the same vein, in ultra-precise micromachining, you may have to worry even about early-stage wear, because it can subtly affect the dimensions of the tool. In such cases, amorphous "diamond" coatings offer more definite benefits compared to TiAlN, often extending tool life by a factor of 2-3x. Alas, the coating at a 30%-40% premium and is available only for some tools. (True, crystalline diamond works, too, but costs a lot more and is reserved for more demanding jobs.) What to buy: If you're on a tight budget, skip any coatings and pocket the change. Otherwise, TiAlN or amorphous diamond is probably not a complete waste of money, although you can still skip it on your first set of "training wheel" tools. Tip geometry: precision machining operations in plastics will almost always rely on "vanilla", single-end finishing tools with no chip-breaking ridges, no taper, no coolant outlets, and so forth. The tips of these standard tools come in three basic flavors: Flat tip cutters are the primary tool in all sorts of mechanical work. Ball nose cutters come handy when you need to reproduce gentle slopes and other organic designs. And lastly, corner radius cutters offer a compromise design that combines 90° arcs in the corners, and a flat mid-section - but you can safely ignore them until you have a specific itch to scratch. About the only other type of a cutter worth mentioning here are conical engraving cutters, which look like this; these are useful for making very fine but shallow cuts, for example when machining traces on a PCB. What to buy: build a competent collection of flat tip cutters first. If you want to experiment, grab one or two ball nose cutters, but you probably won't be using them that much in non-artistic work. Cutting diameter: end mills come in cutting diameters from 0.01 mm (a lot thinner than human hair) to 50 mm and more. For most intents and purposes, cutters below 0.25 mm or so are just not very useful, unless you are doing some truly hardcore micromachining; and over 8 mm or so, they get too big to mount and meaningfully use on benchtop mills. Your cutters need to strike a sensible balance: large tools can't machine tiny features, but small tools remove very little material in every pass, making them useful mostly for selective refinishing work. In fact, a two-fold reduction in tool cutting diameter often translates to a 10-fold reduction in effective material removal speed! What to buy: try to get a 3 mm (or 1/8") cutter to handle most of the machining work; for large projects, 6 mm (or 1/4") may come handy, too. On top of that, keep 0.4 mm and 1 mm cutters for touching up fine details. Cutting diameter tolerance (tricky!): "1 mm" cutters don't always have a diameter of 1 mm. In a nod to the legacy of drilling and tapping applications, many manufacturers make their tools to non-symmetric tolerances, as denoted either with a pair of explicit values (say, +0.00 / -0.04 mm), or with an ISO tolerance code such as "e8". Of course, modern tool grinding machines are often a lot more precise than that; micron accuracy is not unheard of. The machine is therefore preset to simply crank out tools at the mid-point of the specified range. Using the example of a 1 mm tool specified as +0.00 / -0.04 mm, the actual diameter will end up being 0.98 mm or so. In most uses, you won't even notice - but then, every now and then, such a subtle difference can bite back. Okay, so the case of explicit tolerances is pretty clear; as for the "e8" case: for cutters with diameters below or equal to 3 mm, the offset is -0.021 mm. For cutters over 3 mm and up to 6 mm, the difference is -0.029 mm. What to buy: whatever you want, just make sure to double-check the tolerance, and write down the actual diameter of the tool. Also, if the vendor declares a suspiciously sloppy tolerance, approach such tools with caution, and perhaps ask the company if they mean it. Shank diameter: this is the diameter of the top portion of the end mill - the one that goes into the holder. It has no significant effect on the cutting process, so you simply need to make sure that you have a matching collet for all the tools you intend to buy. Cutting length: the cutter will have flutes extending only through some of its length. The height of the cutting region sets the upper limit of how deep the tool can be driven into the workpiece in a single pass. What to buy: for the processes outlined here, you typically only need the flutes to extend to a distance equal to about 50% of tool diameter. Because the flute-bearing section somewhat more vulnerable than the rest of the end mill, and may also be subject to uneven wear, it's actually beneficial to opt for stub-flute tools when you have a choice. Reach length: many end mills have a neck - a section between the flutes and the shank, across which the diameter of the tool does not exceed that of the cutting tip (and in most cases, is about 10% percent smaller). The distance from the tip of the tool to the end of this section puts an absolute limit on the depth of machining near any vertical walls: As you can see in the rightmost drawing, the problem can be avoided by introducing a non-zero draft angle: a subtle slant on any tall, vertical walls. Draft angles also help with removing cured parts from rigid molds - but are not always desirable or practical. That's why having a tool with a decent reach length is still a good plan. On the flip side, more is not always better: with miniature long-reach tools, as the neck gets longer, the cutter becomes more prone to deflection and easier to break. A 1 mm tool with a 3 mm reach can be operated with few worries; at 10 mm, you need to be a bit more careful; and at 30 mm, it starts to require ninja skills. Oh, of course, some tools don't have a neck to speak of; in these cases, there is a taper that immediately follows the flutes, and reach length is identical to cutting length. That may be good or bad, depending on whether flute length is sufficient for your needs. Note: there is an interesting special case - some 3 mm or 6 mm tools have shank diameter identical to their nominal cutting diameter; the same goes for their imperial 1/8" and 1/4" counterparts. You can think of them as having reach length equal to total tool length, minus about 20 mm needed for the collet. There are some drawbacks of driving these tools deeper than their cutting length, though: their pretend "neck" doesn't have a reduced diameter, so when dealing with zero draft angles, it may end up rubbing against the workpiece. This usually has no effect in prototyping plastics, but quickly becomes a problem in metals and other tough stuff. The situation gets slightly worse if the actual cutting diameter is smaller than the nominal one, due to non-symmetric tolerances. In these cases, driving such a tool too deep may have a minor but noticable impact on dimensional accuracy or surface finish. What to buy: moldmaking often involves relatively deep cuts and vertical walls. Make sure that your 3 mm tools have a reach of at least 20-30 mm; for 1 mm, stick closer to 10 mm; and for 0.4 mm, 2-4 mm should do the trick. Overall length (OAL): self-explanatory. Typical mold cutters have lengths of about 50 to 75 mm; some lower cost or subminiature tools may be available as 38 mm, too. Longer end mills - up to 150 mm or so - are also available, but seldom worth the price. The main significance of this parameter is that the tool will stick out of the spindle by no more than OAL, less something around 15 mm for the part that needs to be gripped by the collet. Life gets more complicated when the collet nut and the rest of the spindle gets in the vicinity of the workpiece, so it's preferable to have tools long enough to deal with the typical depth of the molds you are planning to work on. What to buy: if your projects will be anything like mine, your molds will probably range from about 6 to 22 mm in depth, with infrequent excursions down to 40 mm or so. If so, OAL of 50-75 mm is a good pick. Number of flutes: higher flute count translates to faster material removal rates and superior finish, because there are more cutting passes per every turn of the spindle. Unfortunately, there are modest limits to how many sufficiently robust flutes you can cram onto a small cutter, and still have enough room for swarf; 4 flutes are the common limit, although 6 are not unheard of. What to buy: for the materials we will be using for moldmaking, the more flutes, the better; at least three or four are strongly desirable on 3 mm cutters, and nice to have on smaller tools. For aluminum, rubbers, and malleable plastics, one or two flutes may be a better pick. Helix angle: zero degree flutes are perfectly straight, and run vertically along the tool. The industry standard is 30°, which offers a sensible balance between edge sharpness, vibration, and swarf removal speed. Lower angles are used to rapidly engage and remove softer materials (e.g., rubbers, thermoplastics); while higher angles improve tool life and reduce vibration in hard materials. What to buy: there is virtually no difference between 15, 30, 45, and 60° when working with easily machinable plastics; you can safely disregard this parameter, and just focus on finding the most interesting and the most affordable tool. Center cutting ability: almost all the cutters of interest to CNC work have a bottom flute that extends through the entire diameter of the tool - which allows it to be plunged straight down into the workpiece, and effectively act as a somewhat competent drill. But a small minority of end mills are not center-cutting, and can't be operated this way. You probably don't want that. What to buy: avoid non-center-cutting tools. Phew! My favorite tool manufacturer is Hanita (now a division of Kennametal, confusingly sold under the brand name of WIDIA): they have an unmatched selection of metric tools at reasonable prices, and are available all over the world. If you are in the States, Sierra Tool is a good reseller; Centerline Industrial is a bit cheaper, but for some reason, refuses to ship to residential addresses. And if you are anywhere in Europe, I can strongly recommend ordering Hanita products with ITC. Hanita aside, Harvey Tool has a very interesting selection of imperial system miniature tools in the US - and I found K&H Sales to be a dependable distributor. Other US manufacturers include OSG Tap & Die, Monster Tool, Micro100, and Microcut, but their catalogs are not as impressive. Readers in the EU may want to check out Nachreiner. Here are the catalogs of the three most interesting manufacturers: Hanita: full end mill range (most are "e8"). Harvey Tool: all tools (some have non-symmetrical tolerances). Nachreiner: carbide finishers. As for practical recommendations, I would suggest starting with Hanita 401403000, 402403000, or Harvey 73118-C4, as the baseline "3 mm" cutter ($15-$30); Hanita 7N2201021 or Harvey 76440-C3 for 1 mm work ($30-35); and Hanita 7N2200410 or Harvey 992515-C3 as a long-reach ~0.4 mm tool ($35). If you are not on a very tight budget, it makes sense to order two of each - it's easy to mess something up in the heat of initial experimentation. With the tools selected, you also need to make sure you have the right set of collets. For ER16, if you are not desperate to save a few bucks, try Rego-Fix "UP" (ultra-precision) collets; they retail for about $45 a pop, and are carried by K&H; another good option are "DNA" collets from Techniks (about $30, require a custom nut). You can find lower-cost collets from many other, more obscure brands - but they are not always particularly good. Oh, one more thing: for ER16, every collet has a specified clamping range - for example, 3.00-2.00 mm. It is always preferable to use the upper value: a 3.00-2.00 mm collet is better than a 4.00-3.00 one when holding a 3 mm tool. Before embracing any complex or high-precision projects, it is important to understand the performance of your mill, and see if anything needs to be fixed, adjusted, or compensated for. While CNC mills don't require constant tuning, making several simple measurements after unpacking the device can save you a lot of time. If you neglect this step, you will find that troubleshooting mill accuracy issues in complex, real-world projects tends to be a daunting task, simply due to the sheer number of variables to look at. The essential tool that you will need to perform the initial measurements is a micron-resolution dial indicator with a magnetic base. You can get a no-name unit on eBay for about $50 (link), or go with Mitutoyo or other reputable brand for about $220 (indicator, base). For lower-cost mills with a rotary tool acting as a spindle, you may be better served by a 0.01 mm indicator, though; in this case, you can get a Mitutoyo one for about $80 (link, base not included). The first thing to check is the runout of the spindle and the tool holder. Wipe clean the internal spindle taper and the collet (use WD-40 if there is any excess grease or other accummulated dirt; a small brass brush works well for any stubborn gunk), and install a tool that extends at least about 20-30 mm from the collet. Tighten until you feel definite resistance, but don't overdo it - excess force may deform the collet, and is not essential in lightweight work. Next, affix the dial indicator to the table or other sturdy surface, make the tip of the indicator touch the tool near the spindle, and observe the change in readings as you gently turn the spindle by hand, preferably at the top (the mill should be turned off, of course). Be very careful not to exert any unnecessary pressure on any of the parts. Let's call the result of this measurement Rcollet. Move the indicator about 10 mm lower (stay clear of the flutes) and repeat the test; we'll refer to it as Rmiddle. Finally, if possible, remove the tool and the collet, and reposition the indicator to make contact with the internal taper of the spindle (the measuring tip now pointing up). Repeat the procedure, and write down the result - Rtaper. Here's how to interpret the data: Rtaper: this measurement tells you about the concentricity of the spindle itself. If it is excessive, it may be time to service the spindle (e.g., adjust the internal tension spring; disassemble it and install a new pair of precision bearings; or, insert a shim somewhere to fine-tune the concentricity). Rcollet: if the spindle measurement looks OK (and only then!), this value helps you estimate the eccentricity contributed by the tool holder (on top of Rtaper). If the value is high, examine the collet for dirt and damage (again, WD-40 is a pretty good cleaning liquid). Small tool holder misalignment can be often "fixed" simply by adjusting the tightening torque, or applying a gentle pressure to the appropriate side of the tool when tightening the nut. If that doesn't help, replacing the collet - perhaps with a higher-quality model - may be the way to go. Rmiddle: this value lets you estimate the eccentricity at the tip of the tool, which ultimately, is the most important observation to make. You can see if the TIR is increasing, decreasing, or staying about the same in relation to Rcollet - and use that to extrapolate the apparent diameter of the tip. For a quality machine with a dedicated spindle and ultra-precision ER16 collects, after some adjustments, TIR should preferably stay within 2 µm or so; and for any mill, it is good to have runout within 0.01 mm. If you are seeing something much worse, poke around and see if you can improve it: it's usually simpler than it may seem. For example, the factory spindle that came with my MDX-540 mill had a TIR of about 6 µm; using a hook spanner to adjust the tension of the internal spring by one tenth of a turn reduced the value to 1 µm. In more complex cases, switching around or rearranging the existing bearings inside the spindle, or replacing them with new ones, will often do the trick. Tip: try to quickly repeat the Rcollet measurement after every tool change, even if you are not doing high-precision work. Trapped dirt will affect the concentricity of the tool holder, and even a tiny difference can easily reduce tool life by 50%, and increase cutting noise by more than that. Spindle eccentricity aside, it is also useful to verify that the tool is truly perpendicular to the X-Y plane; if that's not the case, for example because one of the screws that attach the spindle to the rest of the mill is not tightened to the same torque, you may see somewhat perplexing dimensional errors in machined parts. The test you should perform is exceedingly simple: you need to mount a cutter that offers at least around 2-3 cm of clearance between the collet and the flutes; programmatically lower the spindle by 2 cm or so; and set up the dial indicator as shown on the previous drawing, in section 2.3.1. When done, gently rotate the tool to find the mid-point of its TIR, and then programmatically move the spindle up by about 1 cm. The same procedure should be repeated after repositioning the dial indicator to make contact with the side of the tool (rather than the front). If everything is fine, you should see no appreciable change in the values shown by the dial indicator; a few microns may be fine, but if the difference is getting close to 0.01 mm, you should definitely investigate. The issue is almost always trivial to fix: you may need to loosen the screws that hold the spindle in place, and perhaps insert a shim made out of aluminum foil on the offending side to straighten it out. Caution: before operating the mill, be sure to read the safety tips provided by the manufacturer, as well as the advice included in section 7 of this guide. Small CNC machines are not particularly deadly power tools, but they are still power tools - and it's your responsibility to use them safely. The spindle assembly is typically fairly heavy, and under normal operating conditions, will be rotating rapidly. At these speeds, any poorly balanced rotating part, any malfunctioning ball bearing, and any damaged transmission belt may easily introduce significant vibration - and that vibration will inevitably propagate to the end mill or the workpiece. It is difficult to accurately measure high-frequency vibration without the help of specialized tools, but this shouldn't stop you from performing two rudimentary checks. Try this: Attach your dial indicator to the table or other part of the mill frame, and let the tip touch any non-rotating part of the spindle. Run the spindle at several different speeds, and observe the reading; oscillation of the indicator hand, if any, should stay well under 1 µm. Remove the tool, grab a long screwdriver, and carefully touch any non-rotating part of the spindle with its tip. Be vigilant, and keep your body and the screwdriver itself well clear of any moving parts. When the tool is touching the spindle, you shouldn't be able to hear any ringing noise, or sense any appreciable vibration in the palm of your hand. If any of these tests reveals excessive vibration, the first thing to do is disenage the motor from the spindle (there's usually a belt or some sort of a clutch involved); if the problem doesn't go away, you know that the problem is with the motor itself, in which case, it may be useful to have it serviced or replaced. If the spindle is to blame, replacing the internal bearings would be the obvious next step. Whatever the cause is, fixes shouldn't be too expensive, but pinpointing the issue may take a while. Repeat accuracy is the single most important factor limiting the precision of the parts you can make. Even if you are not planning to machine anything particularly intricate, this parameter is still worth checking: if it's alarmingly poor, it may be indicative of a problem with the mill. To estimate the accuracy of the machine, brace the tip of the dial indicator against the side of the spindle assembly, and then programmatically move the spindle away in the X axis, in 0.01 mm increments (or whatever the nearest multiple of your mill's mechanical resolution is supposed to be). After about 5-10 steps or so, reverse the direction, and gradually move back to the starting point. Here's what to look for: Every step should move the needle of the dial indicator by the same amount, ideally within 1 µm, and definitely within 0.01 mm. Jerky stepping may be due the increments not being a multiple of the actual hardware resolution of the mill, or due to wiring problems in the stepper motor. The actual travel distance, as measured by the dial indicator, should match the expected distance closely. If there's any substantial error that seem to be proportional to how far you are moving, your CNC software should let you compensate. The locations of the steps when moving away from the dial indicator should be the same as when moving back; and the spindle should return to the same starting position at the end of the test. Any observable offset is probably due to backlash - which should be in the micron range. There may be some limited ability to compensate for this in software (for example, your CNC application may offer low-level motor calibration settings), but it's not a silver bullet. Of course, try to repeat this procedure for all axes. If in any of them, repeat accuracy is worse than 0.01 mm, it may be good to talk to the manufacturer. We're almost done! The last parameter of note is the loss of accuracy you can expect if the mill is braking or accelerating rapidly, or aggressively plowing through a difficult workpiece. The value depends on the rigidity of mill frame, and the type and quality of its linear motion systems. If it's poor, there is no reason to despair - but it means that you may have to slow down when doing precision work. The test here is extremely simple: with the mill on but the spindle turned off, brace the dial indicator against the side of the cutting head, and then use your hand to gently press the spindle from the other side - along the tested axis. Don't overdo it: the goal is to exert may be 20-50 g of force, and not to overcome the holding torque of the motors. In a quality mill, the momentary deflection should stay under 5 µm or so - but up to 0.02 mm is something you can live with. Once you know that your machine is behaving correctly, there isn't that much that needs to be done on an ongoing basis: it's a pretty sturdy piece of machinery, and it's usually not subject to heavy wear. Consult the manual for manufacturer-specific advice - but in most cases, the rules are pretty simple: Always keep the collets, cutters, and the spindle taper squeaky clean and lightly lubricated. Get rid of any thick, factory-applied grease (use WD-40 or naphtha to do that); carefully remove all cutting residues (use a small brass brush for any stubborn bits); and apply WD-40 or a similar low-viscosity oil to protect all these components against corrossion - especially after handling them with bare hands. Sweat residue can quickly lead to corrosion! Thoroughly vacuum the mill after every job. Cuttings, if allowed to pile on, may eventually make their way into the sensitive, normally shielded parts of the drivetrain - or more prosaically, may simply obstruct the movement of the table. Do not use compressed air for cleaning, as this can push dirt deeper into the machine, or just spread it around your workshop unnecessarily. Every few hundred hours of machining (1-2 years' worth of weekend projects), wipe old grease and dirt off of ball screws and linear guides, and apply a fresh coat. Medium-viscosity lithium grease is typically the right choice - but check the manual carefully, and whatever you do, avoid mixing lubricants of different kinds. After several thousand hours of use (5+ years), it may be time to inspect the spindle assembly for any obvious wear, loss of concentricity, noise, vibration, or elevated operating temperature - and service it as necessary. If you do it yourself, the replacement of spindle bearings should cost between $40 and $300, depending on the design. Some of the entry-level mills may be using low-cost brushed motors to power the spindle; such motors are a consumable, and may require a replacement after anywhere from 100 to 2,000 hours - but typically don't cost much. Higher end machines usually rely on brushless motors that should last a decade or more. Linear drivetrain motors, bearings, and so on are typically not subject to substantial wear when doing lightweight hobbyist work; if properly maintained, they should last pretty much forever. Insufficient lubrication or contamination with abrasive materials (ferrous metals, glass, etc) are about the only things to watch out for. If you are planning to do high-precision work, or simply wish to ensure high-quality surface finish when working with organic shapes, it's useful to measure and document the diameter of every new end mill in your collection. Although the tools are usually manufactured with micron-level accuracy, the specifications can sometimes be wrong, and on top of that, manufacturing variations may occur from batch to batch - for example, due to changes in the thickness of applied coatings or the gradual wear of the grinding tool. Case in point: some of my Harvey's 0.04 inch cutters actually measure around 1.022 mm, rather than the expected 1.016 mm. At these scales, such differences can bite. To perform the measurements, you will need an accurate micrometer. This tool, along with quality calipers, is one of the most important investments you will make, so don't fret: $50 will get you a decent no-name brand, while $140 is enough for Mitutoyo. For two- or four-flute tools, the idea is to gently tighten the jaws of the micrometer around the flutes, while simultaneously rotating the cutter (in the direction opposite to its normal operation) to find the maximum diameter. You need to stop as soon as you feel any resistance, to avoid breaking the tool or gouging the jaws; practice on larger, sturdy end mills before moving on to sub-mm ones. Three-flute tools are a bit harder to deal with. If the flutes are long enough, you may be able to grip the cutter so that one face of the micrometer is touching the peak points of two flutes, and the opposite face is touching the remaining one. That said, with stub-length tools, you may be essentially out of luck; doing a careful test cut and measuring the result may be the way to go (you need to account for TIR and repeat accuracy). Beyond the initial measurements, it is also a good habit to re-check your tools after every 10 hours of cutting or so, preferably measuring the diameter near the very tip. When doing heavy cutting, you may see some reduction in tool diameter as the outer edge of the flutes gets a bit more dull; for this reason, I suggest keeping your primary roughing tool separate from the finishing ones. Tip: even when working with plastics, applying several drops of a cutting fluid to the workpiece can improve finish and limit tool wear by keeping the tool cool and helping remove chips more efficiently - give it a try! For lightweight work, sulfur-free oils, such as Oatey 30200, work best. They are also easy to clean up with a detergent and don't interfere with resin casting work.

Cutting fluids or no fluids, it makes sense to examine your tools for damage and excess wear every now and then. You can't trust your naked eye, but a simple 7x magnifier, selling for under $50, should do the trick. If you have a microscope with magnification between 10x and 50x, that's even better. Here are the two most common cutter failure modes that aren't visible with naked eye - significant wear (left) and a chipped flute (right): Both of these tools will still work, but the one on the left will not hold tight dimensional tolerances in particularly demanding applications; while the one on the right will produce crummy finish in machined parts and will be prone to gumming up. Tip: good bookkeeping is incredibly important in CNC work: computer-aided design and creative chaos simply don't mix. Cultivate good habits starting with end mills: make sure that you have a spreadsheet (or even a flat text file) listing all the tools you have, outlining their geometry, and making note of the measurements you have taken. Having such a list will not only help you avoid surprises, but will also make it easier to maintain a healthy stock of tools - so that you never have to put a project on hold for two weeks after accidentally breaking your last 0.4 mm end mill. Having such a list will not only help you avoid surprises, but will also make it easier to maintain a healthy stock of tools - so that you never have to put a project on hold for two weeks after accidentally breaking your last 0.4 mm end mill. By now, you should have a good idea of which mill to choose, where to find the cutters, and how it all fits together... or perhaps you own a 3D printer, and didn't read the previous chapter at all. Either way, the next step is getting comfortable with the software needed to bring your ideas to life. In this section, we'll go over some of the basics, and then proceed with a simple starter project of our own. The primary function of CAD software is, quite simply, to let you design 3D parts. Your CAD application may be just about any general-purpose modeling program, such as Blender - but in the long haul, it makes sense to settle for a purpose-built tool. "Real" mechanical design software offers better control over part accuracy, and comes with powerful data input and analysis tools that streamline engineering work. On the flip side, they usually have less impressive rendering capabilities - and may come with no support for animation, physics, and other perks taken for granted in general-purpose 3D apps. For now, though, the distinction between general-purpose modeling tools and CAD isn't that important. You simply need to get comfortable with any 3D design software of your choice - and that takes a bit of work. A-ha, that's a good question indeed! In the previous edition of this guide, I tried to give an impartial overview of the market - but in the end, there is plenty of choice, and very few genuinely bad CAD tools. You can just look around, find the one you like and can afford. If you just want a simple recommendation - and are willing to spend some money on software to begin with - Rhino 3D is probably the best CAD package that you can get on a hobbyist budget. Students can purchase a fully-featured edu license for under $140, so if you are still in the academia, it would be foolish not to go for it. For mere mortals, there is a heftier price tag attached - $750 - so it's a more difficult call. Still, it's a mature and user-friendly tool that runs well even on low-end systems, and it's just done well - so you probably won't regret it. Now, if Rhino is priced outside your league, many people in the community are also fond of Alibre Design PE, which sells for about $100. Or, if you prefer not to spend any money at all, and can live with a somewhat clunky app, then FreeCAD looks fairly OK for simpler work. What else? Several accomplished DIYers use general-purpose 3D modeling tools such as Sketchup or Blender. The free-of-charge general-purpose tools are pretty diverse and mature; the only problem is that they may be less suited for complex work later on. If you are willing to cross that bridge when you come to it, they are definitely worth a try as a starter option. Last but not least, cash-strapped DIYers may also want to check out one of the "demo" editions of commercial CAD tools. For example, Creo Elements has a modest limit of 60 parts per document, but otherwise, should do the trick. We should probably start the lesson with a gentle warning: CAD programs tend to have a fairly steep learning curve. This is in part because you are forced to manipulate 3D objects using a 2D input device and a 2D display - and it takes a while to master that skill. The other problem is that these applications tend to use unfamiliar UI paradigms and obscure terminology - and even something as simple as right-clicking an object may have an unexpected result. It takes some effort to start using the software in a competent way - and if you're just banking on your innate abilities, you will probably learn to do things exactly the wrong way. If you want to make real progress, here are some rules to live by: Read the manual and do the tutorials. Trust me, you are not too good for this - even if you never had to do that with any other software. Set aside 2-3 days to go through all the exercises, and read the help pages. You need to understand what the program has to offer and what terminology it uses; even if you have some experience with 3D modeling software, you will learn a lot. Give your mouse a break. Try to do as much as possible without clicking around the UI. Learn command names and keyboard shortcuts, and make a habit of entering coordinates and dimensions manually. Find hotkeys for enabling, disabling, and changing grid and object snaps, changing drag modes, constraining movement, zooming and rotating viewports, and so on. This will save you plenty of time. Don't approximate. Never move objects around to make them just sort-of fit together. Learn to leverage object snaps, or use parametric operators to move, copy, rotate, or replicate objects with precision. If you don't, you will quickly start accummulating subtle geometry errors that will cause many 3D operations to unexpectedly fail later on (e.g., due to self-intersecting curves or imperceptible gaps). Don't believe in magic. CAD programs often come with advanced features to automatically calculate intersections or unions of 3D solids, place and remove holes, etc - but these functions aren't perfect, and tend to misbehave at least opportune times. Instead, learn to break down complex problems into simple steps, and operate on intuitive primitives (e.g., planar curves and surfaces) for as long as possible in the editing process. This also makes it easier to revise your designs later on. Before you start, there's just one more thing to do - you need to customize the program for precision work. Needless to say, the tolerances needed to design a building aren't the same as when designing a gearwheel - and CAD applications are used for both. For now, simply go through the configuration pages, and try to do the following: System units: set to millimeters. Or don't, but I find inches pretty unwieldy for precision work. Precision: set precision (or tolerance, or accuracy) to 0.5 µm (0.0005 mm) or so. Display mesh tolerance can be set to about 0.01 mm, simply to speed up rendering. Display grid: enable if necessary, and set major spacing to 5 mm, and minor spacing to 1 mm. Set grid size to match the work area of your machine. Snaps: disable object and angle snaps by default (you will be able to turn them on with a hotkey when necessary). Enable linear snaps and set distance to 0.5 mm. If the program supports it, turn on "planar" mode for snaps, where all the object snap points are projected to the construction plane of the current viewport. Viewports: switch to four-viewport display mode - showing top, front, and right sides of the model, plus a rotatable "perspective" (axonometric) view. Zoom in all viewports so that there are about 2-4 mm between the grid lines displayed on your screen. Shading mode: configure all viewports to use 3D shading, preferably with translucent surfaces (opacity around 80-90%; "ghosted" preset in Rhino), and with 1 pixel edge thickness. If possible, set a different edge color (e.g., red) for any "naked" edges that do not form a closed solid. Done? Then let's roll... Your first job is to figure out how to draw several simple, two-dimensional shapes on the X-Y construction plane (i.e., using the "top" viewport of your CAD app). Try do to sketch all of the following: A single, straight line segment, A multi-segment zig-zag line (with sharp turns), A closed multi-segment line, where the end is joined with the beginning, A circle, using three methods: center point and diameter; two boundary points; and three boundary points, An arc - by selecting center point, diameter, and start / stop angles, A rectangle, using two methods: two corner points; or a center point and one corner, A polygon - circumscribed and inscribed, with a specified number of sides. Practice a bit; perhaps sketch a simplified, boxy outline of a car, complete with wheels. When you are comfortable with these 2D primitives, it's time for your next exercise: try to draw a smiley face without using your mouse at all. Type in the required commands and specify coordinates by hand; the display grid should be of great help. Oh - for some extra credit, add a hat! With your drawing in place, it's time to get familiar with several important operators. Figure out how to select one or more objects with your mouse, and then find the commands that perform the following tasks: Move selected objects by a specified distance in the current viewport, Duplicate ("clone") an object, likewise, Rotate object by a specified angle, around a selected point in the viewport, Flip (or "mirror") selected objects around a specified axis, Scale object proportionately in all directions, by a specified factor, Scale object in one direction only, Form an array of objects by cloning the selection at a given linear interval, Form a radial (polar) array by cloning the selection at an angular interval. Play around with these operators until you are comfortable with the way they work; pay special attention to scaling and rotation operators, and the way they are affected by the choice of the origin, reference point, and the viewport. As soon as you are done moving, flipping, and cloning stuff, locate and play with the analytic tools that let you do the following: Measure the distance between any two points, Measure the angle between two straight lines, Calculate the diameter (or radius) of a circle or an arc, Find the center point of a circle or an arc, Show maximum deviation between two similar curves, Compute the surface area of any closed curve. This is a good opportunity to experiment with object snaps, too: enable them temporarily, and check the various options they offer. In particular, be sure to give tangent snaps a try: draw three random circles, and then try to connect them with tangent lines, like this: Piece of cake? Thought so! You should be now ready to master several more complicated modeling skills. Note: Somewhat surprisingly, 2D drawing techniques are more important than any 3D sketching tools; in fact, you should resist the temptation to play with 3D primitives at this point. The bulk of mechanical modeling work is almost always done with spline curves, which are later converted into 3D objects with the help of operations such as extrusion, revolution, or lofting. We'll get to these operators soon. Your CAD application probably stores every curve as a non-uniform rational B-spline. The visual representation of this mathematical model is not very easy to grasp, but getting a hang of it is essential to any sort of serious modeling work. In essence, every NURBS curve is defined by three parameters: Degree: this parameter defines how many control points will be simultaneously affecting the trajectory of the curve at any given location. Degree 1 curves allow just two points to have a say, with a linear transition between the starting and the destination point (i.e., a straight line). For degree 2 curves, the shape is influenced by three points, allowing it to have smooth bends. With degree 3, the number grows to four, and so on. Control points: every curve is accompanied by at least degree + 1 control points, to which it is progressively attracted to along its length. In degree 1 curves, control points simply lie on the curve (at the vertices). For degrees 2 and above, the points are often positioned outside the curve, forming a sort of an editable, elastic envelope, as shown below. Knots: these are the intervals along the length of the curve at which the influence of a previous control point ends, and the influence of a new one begins. Think of it as a way to pace the changes: densely packed knots can result in sharper turns. Note: it is possible to have multiple subsequent knots at the same location. If the number of knots in a cluster is equal to the degree of the curve, it's called a kink: it effectively forms a barrier that prevents control points on one side to have any influence over the other, and vice versa. This allows the curvature to change aburptly, forming a proper angle. Curves can be losslessly broken into separate segments at such a kink, too. An example of a degree 2 spline with no kinks is shown below; control points are marked in yellow, and knots are red: To practice a bit, try to locate the command that lets you draw a curve of a given degree by specifying subsequent control points. Get a hang of its behavior particularly for curve degrees 2 and 3. There should be also a separate command for creating interpolated curves that go through any number of specified "via" points that you click on, which may be useful for tracing around bitmaps and so forth. Oh, one more thing: using both of these tools, try to create a proper kink! When you are comfortable with drawing, experiment with the following curve-editing tools: Displaying and moving around control points for an existing curve, Adding and removing control points, inserting a kink, Non-uniform refitting, to simplify the curve or remove kinks while maintaining its approximate shape, Soft-editing a curve by dragging a selected point on its surface, Displaying curvature and continuity information - can you spot any exising kinks? Last but not least, be sure to familiarize yourself with the "explode" operator that splits curves at existing kinks (see what it does to a rectangle, circle, etc); and the "join" tool that merges adjacent curve endpoints to form a curve with kinks. As should be apparent by now, NURBS curves can be separated and joined at kinks in a completely lossless manner: the underlying coefficients do not have to change, and there is no gradual reduction of accuracy if you repeat these operations 100 or 1,000 times. Unfortunately, in many cases, you will need to truncate curves at locations that do not correspond to any existing kink. In these situations, the CAD application will be usually forced to create a new curve with a different set of control points in the vicinity of the cut. This fitting process usually works very well, and the resulting deviation should be much smaller than your configured tolerance, but you should be aware that the operation does not come completely free. With that warning in mind, find the command that let you split a curve at a point where it intersects with another one, and experiment with it. For degrees higher than 1, you should be able to see the effect it has on the set of control points for the curve - and if you ask the program to calculate the deviation between the input and the output curve, it will probably give you a tiny but non-zero result. Examine the deviations for a couple of input curves to see what to expect in normal work. In addition to the curve splitting tool, there may be also a second operator that works roughly the same way, but lets you immediately delete (trim) the unwanted parts. It may sometimes save you a click, so if possible, get familiar with it. In any case, it's time for a brief exercise. Remember the command for drawing radial arrays? Try to combine that with splitting and trimming to arrive at a result such as this: Nice, eh? It's not quite a proper gearwheel, but we're pretty close. Note: as mentioned earlier, it is always preferable to use the simplest editing tools that still do the job. In particular, you should always favor the join, explode, refit, split, and trim operators over any features that, for example, automatically compute unions, differences, or intersections of 3D objects. Why? Well, these advanced tools quickly go bonkers if you have something as simple as two closely touching, parallel walls - not to mention accidental self-intersections, non-watertight curves or solids, etc. It's one thing if they just fail in an obvious way... but if the resulting error is subtle and goes unnoticed, you may end up having to redo a good chunk of your work later on. We're almost done with curves - hooray! But before we go, there are three other, immensely useful editing tools that you should probably learn about: The fillet operator is applied to any angle (kink) on a curve, and replaces it with a specified radius. The trick is often used for engineering purposes: fillets serve as a stress relief in sharp corners and drastically improve their strength. But even more interestingly, filleting lets you capture the real-world result of machining a corner with an end mill of a given size - which is important for certain types of snap fits. This illustation shows the use of filleting to determine the actual shape of a machined part: Note: Of course, it's not that you can't make a competent acute angle with a CNC mill. For example, refinishing the one on the left with a 0.4 mm cutter would result in a deviation of barely 0.3 mm. Still, in many cases, it's more convenient to account for such intrinsic fillets in your designs, than it is to refinish the workpiece with a separate tool. Oh, one more thing: in situations where you don't control the shape of the mating part (lighter blue in the picture below), you can always resort to bone fillets, too: Chamfering is a similar operation, but it replaces the selected kink with a straight segment that starts at a specified distance from the vertex. Compared to fillets, chamfering may have a more desirable appearance, depending on the effect you are aiming for - and produces a much simpler 3D mesh. The last operator, offsetting, offers an interesting way to resize any shape: it creates a derived curve that consists of points at a particular, constant distance from the original geometry. It is quite different from traditional scaling, in the same way that gaining weight is different from growing bigger - and it comes quite handy for generating walls, undersizing or oversizing parts, and so forth. Well, that's really it! You may also want to explore tools that let you extend or close curves, or blend them with more fine-grained controls - but for most intents and purposes, we are ready to talk about something a bit cooler than that. Let's start building three-dimensional solids. It's simple: draw a closed curve, and then find the command that creates a planar surface from it. Examine the result, then check out what happens if you select two curves, one within another. What about separate or intersecting input curves? Examine failure modes of this operator, too: what if one of the input curves is at a slightly different Z level? What if the curve is open or self-intersects? Of course, the planar surface that you have just created is still, well, pretty flat. The next important operator to play with is extrusion: select your curve, and using the side view, select the extrusion height. Disable the creation of top and bottom "caps": we just need the side walls. Try to use the join operator to merge the flat base surface with the extruded wall. If it worked, you have pretty much mastered 3D work. Lets try a slightly more complicated exercise: That's pretty easy, eh? In fact, it's a lot simpler to construct shapes this way than it is to start with 3D primitives, and clumsily piece them together. But don't let it go to your head. Spend a few more minutes playing with extrusion: see what it does to open or self-intersecting curves, to multiple curves that overlap or aren't at the same Z level, and so on. You should also take this opportunity to experiment with the explode, split, and trim operators that you remember from your curve editing days. Draw two solids and make them overlap, then see if you can use the trim operator to remove all the overlapping internal sections, and join the resulting outer shells into a new, closed shape. Can you do the same to "subtract" one solid from another, or only keep the intersection? Find the analytic tool that lets you calculate the volume of each of the solids, and use it to double-check that your results check out. Oh, one more thing: can you trim surfaces with curves? Why not give it a try! These tools aside, there are several other advanced surface editing operators that you should be aware of; they are particularly important if you want to create organic shapes without having to think too much: Curve revolution: this operator lets you draw a surface by taking any curve, and rotating it around a specified axis, and letting it leave a trail in the 3D space. This is the method of choice for creating many simple shapes with axial symmetry - bottles, vases, cans, chess pieces, rings. In fact, try to create each one of these. Lofting: this mechanism lets you "drape" a surface through a series of curve outlines arranged in the 3D space. Think of it as the opposite of slicing. It comes handy in a variety of situations, including creating draft angles for molds, or adding a handle to a cup. Play with it a bit - it's fun: Sweeping: this tool lets you select a curve and drag it along a specified rail, generating a surface in the process. It can be seen as a generalized form of curve revolution (in which the rail is always circular). A more advanced version of this operator lets you use multiple rails, which allow variable scaling of the profile curve; or multiple profiles, thus also generalizing the loft operator. Blending, filleting, chamfering: equivalents of the curve editing tools that let you smoothen the edges of your solids. Blending is particularly useful for creating a smooth, variable-curvature joint: The list of useful operators goes on - for example, it's sometimes useful to extract edges from surfaces or solids, to place or remove holes, or to orient something on an oddly-shaped surface - but you can discover these on your own. For now, let's just have a quick look at how to manage your work. It's one thing to sketch a nice 3D box - but any medium-scale project may easily consist of several hundred of such solids, often meshing closely and stacked in creative ways. If you don't manage your virtual workspace well, you will get overwhelmed, make mistakes, or both. The document management tools at your disposal will vary from one program to another, but you should familiarize yourself with at least the following: Grouping. This function lets you combine any number of objects into a single logical component that can be moved around and copied as a whole. Unlike trimming and joining, this operator does not require the objects to form a single solid - in fact, you can group completely disjoint things, such as curves, dimensions, and even light sources for the rendered scene. When necessary, the group can be opened, and its contents can be edited separately. This tool is very useful for conveniently creating serviceable parts from simpler, reusable solids. Note: some programs go beyond simple grouping, and let you instantiate objects loaded from a separate document. These instances are automatically updated to reflect any changes to the "master" document. I find this to be an overkill in my work, but your mileage may vary. Assigning to layers. Layers offer a simple way to centrally manage certain properties of objects, such as visibility or color, without merging them into a single blob. All objects or groups that comprise a named layer can be still accessed individually - although you can also select all members of a layer if so desired. You should use layers to keep track of all instances of any given part, or to denote other important information - for example, that a particular object represents a premade part not meant to be machined, or that it's only a visual aid. Locking and hiding. Objects or layers that get in the way of editing may be locked. This keeps them at least somewhat visible, but prevents any interaction: you can't accidentally select them or move them around. Hiding is a more radical alternative: it completely removes the affected items from view. Locking and hiding is typically best applied to layers, as it usually takes just a single click to toggle this parameter in the layer manager. For individual objects, hiding is useful predominantly for items that you are not planning to access again: for example, any construction curves that were already used to create all the solids you needed, but that are worth keeping around just in case you need to redo something later on. To get them back, you will need to activate a special mode that hides all the visible objects, shows all the hidden ones, and lets you select the ones you want to bring back to life. As soon as you are reasonably comfortable with object management, we can actually make a simple mold! Okay, it's time for some fun. Let's start by trying to draw a heart: Here's what's going on in that illustration: We draw a helper rectangle as a guide for the overall size of the part. This one is 23 mm wide and 20 mm tall. We then use object snaps to draw a vertical line through the middle of the part, which will be our axis of symmetry. Once the guides are sketched out, we add a 13 mm circle (slightly larger than half the rectangle), and align it with the edges of the box. You can use grid snaps for that. We draw an arc using object snaps. The beginning of the arc is tangent to the existing circle, the end is at the bottom of the center guide, and the diameter is manually entered as about 110 mm. We mirror the circle and the arc around the axis of symmetry. At this point, the symmetry guide is no longer necessary, so we delete it. We use the trim operator to remove the internal parts of the heart, and then delete the outer rectangle. Voila! Easy, right? Now, let's join all the curve segments, and turn the whole thing into a mold: See if you can figure out all the steps on your own. The final result should be a watertight box with dimensions around 33 x 30 x 8 cm. Its bottom left corner should be at coordinates (0, 0), and the top surface should be at 0 mm, likewise. The mold cavity should have a 4 mm clearance around the heart, and should be 7 mm deep. The heart itself should be resting at the bottom of the cavity, and should be 4 mm high (its top surface should be at -3 mm). If everything checks out - well, the good news is that you have yourself a master mold (aka a pattern). Now, we cut some corners with the moldmaking process, given the simplicity of this project, but this is how the entire thing usually plays out: Be sure to save that project - we'll need this file soon. CAM software reads the geometry created with your favorite modeling application, and turns it into toolpaths that can be sent to a milling machine, a 3D printer, or some other automated tool. All the computer-controlled manufacturing technologies use a common set of underlying concepts and have a comparable degree of complexity, but there are many details that remain specific to a particular tool. Since we have to choose one way or the other, the rest of this chapter will focus on the software designed for CNC mills. When I first published the original version of this guide, the makers of CAM applications catered almost exclusively to commercial users. The software was ridiculously overpriced, shipped with archaic UIs, and always included a collection of mind-boggling bugs. Thankfully, the emergence of low-cost mills and serious hobbyists is slowly changing that. Still, there is no single package that would be a sure bet for all users, and you need to understand what sets them apart. Here's a quick list of the things that matter the most for everyday CNC work. If you own a computer-controlled rotary axis, or plan on getting one, you should figure out which 4-axis machining modes are supported by the program - and decide if they are worth the extra price. The three fundamental choices are: Indexed cutting (XYZ): in this mode, every milling job is handled using traditional, planar three-axis movements. The only new trick is that the program will automatically rotate the workpiece (and the CAD model itself) in between jobs, letting you machine the part from multiple sides with no extra leg work. This rudimentary approach is probably the most useful one, particularly for engineering work. It works great on geometries that have a small number of distinct, planar faces - for example, a two-sided PCB, a nut, or a rectangular enclosure. Interestingly, indexed cutting is actually fairly easy to simulate by creating several CAD files with the same part rotated by the desired degree, generating toolpaths for each of these files, and then sending them to the mill and rotating the part in between. It takes a bit more time, and there's a higher risk of human error - but it's up to you to decide if the extra convenience is worth spending several hundred bucks extra on your CAM tool. Lathe-type machining (AXZ): in this mode, the Y axis is kept in a fixed position, so that the tool hovers directly over the axis of rotation, or stays at a predefined offset. The workpiece is turning continuously as the milling head is moving up, down, and to the sides. If you haven't seen a lathe in action, this video should clarify what's going on. Such an approach allows efficient reproduction of smooth, cylindrical shapes that would require indexed cuts from 6 or more sides to approximate the shape by traditional means. Examples may include threaded shafts, worm gears, soda bottles, or rings. Unlike the previous mode, this one can't be trivially approximated in a program that doesn't support it natively; but it's also not nearly as essential, not unless you're planning to work on jewelry or other artistic stuff. Fully simultaneous four axis machining (AXYZ): in this mode, the machine is free to move in all four axes while cutting, and the application analyzes the geometry to find the right balance between lathe-like and planar movements. This may result in more efficient machining of complex surfaces with variable curvature or hard-to-reach undercuts - but it's seldom of any use to begin with, and it can be approximated by alternating between the two techniques mentioned earlier; the extra cost is difficult to justify in hobbyist work. What to buy: your call. If indexed cutting is all you need, you may be able to live with lower-cost three-axis CAM. Vendors of CAM software tend to be pretty creative about the range of specialized and obscure machining modes that they offer, but there are only three options that really matter; the rest is either redundant, or doesn't work well in complex molds. Here are the three methods in question; the first two really must be supported by the application you want to go with: Overhead projection: this method amounts to projecting a simple surface-filling pattern onto the workpiece, from the top. In the most basic case, the pattern may be just a bunch of evenly spaced parallel lines, connected together on alternating ends. The tool then follows these lines in the X-Y plane (X-A for lathe-style machining), and is lowered or raised as necessary to reproduce the shape of the part: Such a computationally inexpensive approach is particularly efficient when machining flat regions or very gentle slopes with a flat tip cutter; in this case, the spacing between projected lines (stepover) may be comparable to the diameter of the tool, and still produce excellent surface finish. Alas, the strategy is a bit less suitable as soon as the cutter gets near any vertical surfaces. If the wall is in a direction perpendicular to the toolpath, the process will leave scallops of uncut material, as shown above; the height of the scallop is equal to cutter_radius - sqrt(4 * cutter_radius² - stepover²) / 2. Walls that happen to be parallel to the direction of the cut will acquire a better finish, but the process may leave a layer of uncut material, up to stepover thick. Walls at other angles will get a combination of both artifacts. Note: both of these issues can be remedied to some extent without switching to a more advanced machining strategy. Scallop height can be managed with modest changes to stepover - for example, when using a 3 mm tool, changing stepover from 2 mm to 0.5 mm reduces scallop from 0.38 mm to 0.02 mm - that's a 20-fold improvement at the expense of slowing down by a factor of four. The other problem - with the accuracy of parallel walls - can be fixed by doing a second pass using lines projected at a different angle, so that the cut is no longer parallel in the previously affected area. Of course, the situation gets a lot trickier if you have walls at many different angles, or worse yet, any arcs. Good CAM software be able to not only generate linear projections, but also "offset" patterns that are constructed from an arbitrary outline provided by the user. This has some important benefits that we'll talk about soon; the end result looks kind of like this: Z axis slicing: also known as waterline cutting, this machining strategy starts by creating a stack of horizontal surfaces, evenly spaced in the Z axis. Each of these surfaces intersects the CAD model, and every such intersection results in a number of closed, two-dimensional outlines of the part. These outlines can be then offset for the size of the tool, checked for collisions, connected together, and used as a toolpath: This mode allows for faithful and highly efficient reproduction of intricate vertical features, such as spur gears. On the flip side, it does not do anything useful for horizontal surfaces; and produces staircase patterns on sloped surfaces, unless the spacing of Z levels is unreasonably tight - as seen above. On top of the basic mode with a constant Z step, some of the more expensive CAM programs allow you to automatically detect and optimize the spacing of Z levels based on the geometry of the part. That sounds nice in principle, but I could never get this feature to work in a sensible and consistent way in any of the programs I have tried. 3D draping: this method generates a toolpath that always maintains a particular distance between cuts, or keeps a particular scallop size, regardless of the shape of the machined part; this is somewhat akin to printing linear toolpaths on a piece of fabric, and then laying it over the geometry to be reproduced. This strategy can be a significant time saver when working with organic shapes using ball tip tools, but it is not commonly useful in everyday mechanical work. What to buy: the two first strategies must be supported unconditionally, and should come with no strings attached: you should have full control over how they are used and when. The third one is a plus. Advanced features of these modes, and other toolpath generation methods, matter a lot less. Efficient machining of complex models requires the ability to decide which tool and which strategy will be applied to various regions of the model - and in what order. To facilitate this process, your CAM application should let you define a freeform region for every machining operation, either by selecting an existing boundary curve imported alongside with the 3D model - or by drawing something by hand. It should let you exclude regions within an existing selection by picking a second curve inside the first one, too. These capabilities are pretty much all that matters. You may notice that certain programs have the ability to automatically generate selections based on some property of the model - for example, to only machine flat surfaces, vertical walls, or something in between. These features are sometimes nice, but are usually more limited or less reliable than what you can do in CAD - so don't pay any special attention to this. What else? Oh - several programs offer "residual machining" of regions left over after the previous operation with a larger tool. This sounds great in theory, but is typically both fairly coarse and extremely slow; I tried two applications that supported this feature, and it misbehaved or ran out of memory more often than it proved to be useful. What to buy: curve-based selection is a must. Pay little or no attention to the rest. Some CAM applications do not put any special thought into organizing the toolpath segments that are spewed out by the underlying geometry-analyzing algorithm. Depending on your model, the result of that can be pretty inefficient; for example, a waterline cut that sequentially machines every outline on every layer before moving further down will produce a total of 15 operations when machining these two separate holes (left): The image on the right shows a more sensible ordering: instead of going back and forth between the machined regions, finish one first, and then move to the other. The result is 9 operations, consisting mostly of short movements. Quite a few programs are capable of such common-sense optimizations - but not all. What to buy: it is useful to shop for CAM applications that offer cut optimization, especially for waterline machining. It's not an essential feature, but it's a major time saver. If in doubt, consult the manuals or ask the vendor before buying. G-code - the language supported by most of the CNC machines on the market - has several commands that can be used to execute circular, spiral, or helical movements of the tool. While support for these opcodes is not required, quite a few embedded controllers recognize them, and translate them to motion optimized for the hardware they are hooked up to. CAM programs, however, usually convert input files to polygon meshes, and generate toolpaths where arcs are broken into thousands of small, linear movements. This practice is not just a waste of electrons, but may result in lower machining speeds, because it hinders the ability for the controller to plan ahead and pick the best acceleration and braking strategy. Perhaps more annoying is that if the pitch of the generated 3D mesh doesn't overlap with the hardware resolution of the motors in your CNC mill, needless vibration may be introduced, too. What to buy: If your machine supports arc interpolation, it is good for the CAM program to know how to generate G-code that leverages that. It's not a deal-breaker, but something really nice to have. There are some brief moments in the cutting process where the tool may be pluging head-on into uncut material. Most of the time, though, the tool simply works to widen existing pockets, and engages the material one side at a time. There are two principal configurations possible during that task: In the conventional (aka upcut) mode, contact with the workpiece is made on the left side of the tool, in relation to the direction of movement. Toolpaths generated this way allow the material to be engaged very gradually, starting with a near-zero chip load, and ramping it up. This strategy is less dependent on the rigidity of the tool and the workpiece, and results in superior dimensional accuracy and surface finish with rigid plastics and many other types of easily machinable materials. In the climb (downcut) mode, the orientation of the tool in relation to the workpiece is reversed, and every flute plunges into the material to start at the maximum chip load, and then have it taper off. This approach puts greater strain on the tool - and if the tool or the workpiece deflects, it reduces the dimensional accuracy of the final part. That said, it may offer better cutting speeds or improved surface finish in certain annoying materials - such as metal alloys prone to work hardening, or soft, malleable thermoplastics. In waterline cutting, maintaining a specific direction of cuts comes naturally, and at no extra cost; in fact, it takes special effort to alternate the type of cut between each layer. Overhead projection strategies are more problematic: if the projected pattern is just a bunch of parallel lines, the only way to achieve consistent direction is to cut the first line, raise the tool, move back to the starting side, lower the tool, and make the next cut - in short, there's a lot of non-cutting movements. And that's the major advantage of "offset", spiral-like projections that we have mentioned earlier on: they permit the direction to be maintained without having to raise the tool. What to buy: you should make sure that the software gives you full control over the direction of cut for every machining strategy of note. Not having this ability will make your life miserable, especially when working with miniature, long-reach tools that flex easily. Last but not least, the application you end up choosing needs to support the file formats that can be written by your CAD package. The most common interchange formats include IGES and STEP (both of which are vendor-agnostic); DXF and DWF (originating with AutoCAD); 3DM (Rhino3D); and STL (3D Systems); support for at least one of these is good news - and the more, the better. NURBS surfaces are supported natively in all of these except for STL and DXF, where approximate tessellation may be required. Input formats aside, you also need to confirm that the application actually supports your CNC mill, and can generate suitable output files. If your machine speaks G-code, and the application offers the ability to create custom G-code postprocessors, you may be able to find a third-party converter or write your own one with relatively little effort; otherwise, you need to make sure that the mill is supported out of the box. Here's a short and incomplete list of things that tend to appear in product specifications and may seem important, but typically don't matter much: 2.5D machining strategies: these features are used to convert bitmaps and other 2D input data into engravings, simple cutouts, etc. They are truly useful only if you don't have a CAD application to begin with, which obviously won't be the case. Support for drilling, tapping, boring, and so on: when working in plastics, it makes virtually no sense to buy specialized tools and use exotic toolpaths to make holes and perform similar tasks; end mills, operated the usual way, will almost always do. Manual toolpath editing: this ability may be useful for very simple models, where the toolpaths are trivial, and fixing them by hand may be a convenient alternative to reworking the model. Toolpaths in complex molds are nearly impenetrable, though. Visualization support: the ability to simulate the machining process is a nice addition, especially when making your baby steps with CAM, or when dealing with buggy software - but ultimately, it's not worth the extra price. Once you work out a sensible machining workflow, the results are almost always easy to predict. Collision detection: this lets you prevent cuts where the tool taper or collet holder would hit the workpiece, because you miscalculated the reach of the tool. This is useful chiefly if you have a machine with an automatic tool changer; otherwise, adjusting collision detection settings after every tool change is about as problematic as configuring the toolpath correctly to begin with. Support for workpiece approach methods: center-cutting tools can work as drills, but aren't particularly competent in this role; plunging them directly into tough materials may reduce their life expectancy quite a bit, especially if the cutter has a flat tip. This can be solved by generating toolpaths where the tool enters at an angle - that said, for easily machinable plastics, it's pretty much a non-issue. Cutting wizards, libraries of materials, etc: while these seem cool, they are generally tailored at simple industrial applications or other beginner work. Configuring the parameters manually is almost always a safer bet. Drawing, part editing, and analysis tools: having these capabilities available in a CAM package is useful only if you don't have them in your CAD application - but that, again, shouldn't be the case here. Of course, feel free to ping me if you stumbled upon any other cool-sounding feature, and need help figuring out what it's worth. Well, it's complicated. For starters, your CNC machine may come with a basic CAM application, and that package may turn out to be good enough for starter jobs. For example, Modela Player 4 - the application that comes with Roland mills - is pretty decent. That said, in the long haul, you will probably want to upgrade to something more featured and flexible. Somewhat lamentably, there aren't that many free-of-charge applications that would be easy to use yet powerful enough; FreeMill is one potential choice, but it only supports a single, rudimentary machining strategy - and really, isn't worth much. This leaves you with commercial tools. If you are on a tight budget, you may want to check out MeshCAM ($200), which is actually a very competent package with good technical support. Other alternatives within that price range include Cut 3D, or the hobby license for DeskProto. I have tried both DeskProto and MeshCAM, and both of them are pretty good - so these would be my top picks. Other than that, there are quite a few other reputable choices with prices hovering around $1,000 and more. The pricing in the "pro" segment, especially for more featured packages with 4-axis machining, is still rooted in the era of strictly-industrial CNC - but deep discounts are available to students, and sometimes, to those who buy the software along with the mill itself. Notable applications in this category include VisualMILL / RhinoCAM, Alibre CAM Mayka, madCAM, and quite a few more. If money is no object, or if you can get a good discount, you may want to dig deeper. If you need advice, I've seen VisualMILL in action, and it looked pretty good. Tip: many of the commercial packages have demo versions. These demos are either limited to a 30-day trial, or lack the ability to write G-code, but are otherwise fully-featured - so be sure to check them out before you buy. CAM programs can be counterintuitive; you will probably need to read the manual carefully to even understand how to create a toolpath, or write the resulting NC file. These applications are also often finicky, unforgiving, and buggy - so it's important to take it slow, and check everything twice. Before loading your 3D models, you need to configure the software for your particular machine, either by selecting the appropriate postprocessor, or - in the worst case - by writing your own based on an existing config file for a similar mill (not as scary as it sounds, as long as your machine came with a code reference manual). You should also go through all the configuration options, and make sure that units are set to millimeters, that the tolerance is 1 µm or better, that arc interpolation is enabled if supported by your hardware, and that the G-code coordinate system is set to G54 (the first, default user-configurable coordinate system, and the only one you will be using in hobby work). With this out of the way, you should load the geometry to be cut. Let's use the heart-shaped mold created earlier on; if you need to export it from your CAD application to a mesh-based format, such as DXF or STL, be sure to configure meshing tolerance to 1 µm or better for that step, too, as this setting is often separate from the global value. Once the model is loaded, you need to verify its position. For three-axis work, the mold cavity should be facing up, and the top surface should be aligned with the Z=0 plane in the CAM application; when looking from the top, the bottom left corner of the mold needs to be at X=0, Y=0, too. If it wasn't loaded this way, you can move or rotate it as needed, but also try to figure out what went wrong: is your original CAD model oriented correctly? If that's not the reason, is there a CAM-level option you should have toggled at import time? Well, all right. Once the model is in the right spot, it's time to create some toolpaths next. To maintain sanity, it helps to split the cutting process into several phases. Each of these phases accomplishes a different task, and may use a different tool, feed speed, machining strategy, stepover distance, and so forth. The first phase of almost every project is known roughing; its goal is to remove the bulk of the material as efficiently as possible. Of course, astute readers may ask why this isn't also the final step - and the answer is that, quite simply, heavy chip loads and rapid tool speeds offer limited accuracy; it's better to leave a small margin of uncut material, and refinish the surface in a separate process later on. The usual roughing strategy is a hybrid approach where the model is cut in Z layers, and on every layer, the application first uses a pattern of horizontal movements to clear the pockets, and then performs a waterline-type cleanup pass. Once the first level is done, the toolpath advances to the next one: In some applications, roughing may not include that cleanup pass, in which case, you should probably configure a separate waterline step right after roughing. This is to ensure that the margin of remaining material is reasonably uniform, so that chip loads don't fluctuate wildly later on. Tip: good CAM applications let you use pocket-shaped offset cuts, rather than linear movements; this completely eliminates the need for the waterline cleanup pass. If that mode is offered by your software, take advantage of it - it will speed up the process and also let you maintain a consistent direction of cuts. In any case, for the materials used in this guide, you should configure the roughing process the following way: Tool size: use a 3 mm or 1/8" flat tip cutter, but lie to the application and give it a diameter about 15% higher (say, 3.5 mm). This will cause the toolpath to be slightly farther away from the workpiece than actually makes sense for the tool - thus creating a margin for roughing in the X-Y plane. Tool length offset: tell the program to pretend that the tool is about 5% of tool diameter longer than set on the machine (effectively moving the toolpath up). This introduces a similar margin in the Z axis. (If not supported by the application, you can make this adjustment simply by setting Z origin a bit higher than measured.) Roughing margin: set to zero. Using tool size and length offset is usually more intuitive, especially for toolpaths where you want to have an offset only in a specific direction. Stepover: something between 30% and 50% of tool diameter should do. You can ramp it up even higher, but there's no real need to do so in this case. Z level spacing: set to 1 mm. Especially if the value is high, it should at least vaguely correspond to the spacing of key features of the mold in the Z axis. Tolerance / sampling resolution: for roughing, can be safely set to around 0.01 mm or so, to reduce processing time. Machining speed: use maximum spindle RPM; feed per tooth should be about 0.08 mm (i.e., 2,000 mm/min with four flutes at 6,000 RPM). Cut direction: when using offset cuts, use conventional cutting with the tool first engaging at the center of each pocket. When using linear cuts, set to bidirectional (meander) mode. No special approach strategy required. Machining region: set so that the cutter stays completely within the envelope of our mold, and does not attempt to trace around it. Note that depending on your CAM application, selection regions may work in one of three ways: Tool fully inside: the cutter must stay completely within the bounds of the selection. Nothing that lies outside the region will be machined. Protrusions that lie within the selected area, but are closer than tool_diameter to the boundary, will not be fully profiled, as the tool won't be able to pass between them and the limiting curve. Tool center inside: the center point of the end mill is required to stay inside the selection, but the tool itself can stick out slightly. Features up to tool_diameter / 2 away from the selection can be machined by the tool if necessary. Protrusions within the selection must be at least that far from the boundary to be fully profiled. Tool touches selection: the tool is free to roam anywhere as long as any point of its geometry stays within the selected region. In this mode, features within tool_diameter from the boundary may be machined. Everything within the selection is cut. It doesn't really matter which selection philosophy the application happens to use, as long as you are aware of its behavior, and can plan accordingly. If you are still not sure what's going on, check out this image; teal denotes the desired geometry, the selection rectangle is cyan, and the remaining unwanted material is red: Well, that's pretty much it. Once the roughing operation is set up, simply tell the program to calculate the toolpath, and examine the result closely. Make sure that it actually makes sense: is the tool staying within our virtual workpiece? Do the toolpaths look anything like what we discussed before? If the program can give you estimated machining time, is it less than 10 minutes or so? If everything checks out, congratulations; now, let's finish this thing. Finishing toolpaths typically refine the geometry in several consecutive steps: The vertical (Z axis) margin on flat surfaces is removed using a projection toolpath that has a zero tool height offset, but preserves the original tool diameter offset from the roughing process. The X-Y plane margin around vertical features is removed using properly spaced waterline cuts, configured with the true diameter of the tool. If there are any sloped surfaces, they are locally refinished using a tightly spaced projection toolpath or 3D draping, possibly with a ball end tool (this is not applicable to our model). If there are any holes or tight pockets that couldn't be faithfully reproduced with the current cutter, they are selectively refinished with a smaller one. To take care of the first item on this list, you'd normally want to configure an offset-type, projection finishing toolpath with the following parameters: Tool size: about 2-5% higher than the value used for roughing (3.6 mm or so). Tool length offset and margin: both set to zero. Stepover: not critical; 1 mm is a safe bet. Tolerance / sampling resolution: 0.5 µm or so. Machining speed: maximum RPM; feed speed should be about 0.05 mm per tooth (i.e., 1,500 mm/min with four flutes at 6,000 RPM). Cut direction: conventional if using offset cuts. Otherwise, for parallel toolpaths, use bidirectional cutting mode to save time. Machining region: restrict to the inside of the mold cavity. Make sure that the generated toolpath doesn't climb the sides of the cavity, as this would be a no-op. This step cleans up the flats; now, we need to take care of the walls. This is done with a "pure" waterline toolpath that traces around vertical shapes, and does nothing more. The parameters for this step should be: Tool size: enter the actual, measured diameter of the tool. It's good hygiene to include TIR, if known. Z distance: set to 0.5 mm. In general, this must coincide with the spacing of vertical features of the mold, and shouldn't be too large (to avoid high chip loads). Any features that are not aligned with this parameter may need to be refinished separately. Machining region: restrict to the inside of the pocket. This time, make sure that the outer walls of the pocket will be machined. Starting height: 0 mm. Always double-check this parameter for waterline toolpaths, as rouding errors may sometimes prompt the CAM application to default to something dubious. Everything else should be the same as for the previous step. Well, that's almost it. After this toolpath, the heart should be looking pretty much the way we designed it - with just one minor blemish: center kink in the middle of the heart will have a slight fillet on the top, due to our relatively large 3 mm tool not being able to fully squeeze into that tight spot. To fix this problem, we can perform a selective waterline cut with a 1 mm end mill. Most of the parameters don't change from step #2, except: Tool size: enter the actual, TIR-compensated diameter of the new tool. Z distance: use 0.25 mm. Speed: maximum RPM, feed of around 0.035 mm per tooth should be fine (that's around 450 mm/min with two flutes at 6,000 RPM). Machining region: make a rectangular or circular selection extending a few millimeters around the problematic kink. And... well, that's it! Generate the toolpaths and pat yourself on the back. For future reference: here's the list of maximum recommended cutting parameters for the tools you should have bought. These values are applicable only to several classes easily machinable prototyping materials that we're going to talk about soon - when working in more demanding stock, you will need to slow down: 0.4 mm: feed 0.01 mm/tooth, 0.125 mm cut depth, 0.125 mm stepover, 1 mm: feed 0.035 mm/tooth, 0.25 mm cut depth, 0.4 mm stepover, 3 mm: feed 0.1 mm/tooth, 1 mm cut depth, 2 mm stepover, 6 mm: feed 0.2 mm/tooth, 3 mm cut depth, 5 mm stepover. Speeds reduced by 20-40% are recommended for finishing operations, especially with 3 mm and 6 mm tools. Measure twice, cut once. Before sending any data to the machine, it's always good to recheck your work; 5 minutes of that may save you several hours of troubleshooting in the physical realm. Here are some questions to ask yourself: Have you entered all the values correctly? Confirm tool diameters, stepover, Z distance, and feed speeds. A missing zero or a misplaced decimal point can cost you $20 for a broken tool. Do the toolpaths look OK? Anything that seems weird, suboptimal, or that exits the expected machining envelope? Any places where the toolpath seems to go straight through the geometry? Run a simulation if possible, and inspect the model from all sides. Have you covered everything that needs machining? Are there any spots where toolpaths do not reach, even though you wanted them to? For selective refinishing, have you selected all the regions you wanted to clean up? It's embarrassing to miss a spot. Is there any risk of collisions? Are the toolpaths suitable, given the reach of the tools you are going to use? Are all the traverse movements happening well above the workpiece? Several CAM programs make it easy to misconfigure this, and plunge through an essential part of your work. Try to use that checklist until you are reasonably comfortable with the process; it's not that mistakes are common, but they can strike at inopportune times. If everything checks out, you need to get the toolpaths ready for cutting. In some programs (e.g., Modela Player), the output is done directly from the application - in which case, just sit tight. In many other apps, the data is written to a text file, and that file is then sent to the machine using a separate CNC utility; if so, export ("post") the toolpaths now. Of course, remember to save the toolpath for the 1 mm tool in a separate file! Okay, okay - but first, you need a suitable workpiece. We will cover more permanent options shortly, but for your initial tests, I strongly recommend getting something called machinable wax. It is a hard, rigid, wax-like substance, technically a blend of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and paraffin. It is not the cheapest or most durable stock, but has two important properties: it machines quickly to a very good finish with excellent dimensional accuracy; and more importantly, because it's much softer and more fragile than common plastics, even fairly major mistakes won't immediately result in a broken tool. In the States, the material is available cheaply from the folks at MachinableWax.com. I would suggest ordering their set #17-424215 (featured on this page). It's a box of 12 pieces, 42 x 42 x 15 mm, selling for $21. Don't overdo it - this really isn't the best or the most cost-efficient material for real work, so get just a single box or two. The only other thing you need in advance is a way to secure the wax to the milling table. Your mill may have come with some sort of a clamping system, or at least slots or screw holes that let you rig something together after a quick trip to the hardware store. Alternatively, you may want to consider MWHS01 from High Tech Systems ($100), which is a very versatile and lightweight system of clamps that should work for almost any medium or large CNC mill. That said, when working with easily machinable materials and using small tools, you can also get away with strong, thin double-sided tape, such as 3M 444 or Tesa 4965. Simply place four short strips in the corners of the workpiece, and press it down; then lift one of the corners to detach. Assuming you have all the necessary supplies, we can mount the workpiece at this point. Wipe clean the table and the stock material, apply the double-sided tape as described earlier, and attach the workpiece to the table, making sure that it's entirely within the working area of the mill. Depending on the design of the machine and the length of the tool, you may need to put something underneath the workpiece to allow the cutter to reach it, too. Next, confirm that the workpiece is actually attached securely, and install your 3 mm tool in the collet. Tighten the tool holder, quickly confirm the TIR, and make sure that there is some clearance between the tool and the top of the workpiece when the spindle is fully retracted. Assuming everything is fine, you can now turn on the mill and let it initialize. Caution: I am assuming that, as requested earlier on, you have familiarized yourself with the operating manual of your mill, and with the safety tips information included in section 7 of this guide. As with any power tool, you can get hurt if you are careless. For G-code mills, the next step is to set the coordinate system to G54, then move the tool to align it with the bottom left corner of the workpiece (looking from the top), plus about 5 mm. With the tool at this X-Y location, tell the machine to set its X and Y origins; this is done in a hardware-specific fashion. Setting the Z origin is the last hurdle to deal with. Find a convenient location on the workpiece, in a region that won't be removed in the cutting process. If the machine has a tool sensor, simply place it underneath the tool, and follow the manual to perform the measurement. Without a sensor, you can use the trick we talked about earlier on: place a thin strip of paper or foil on top of the workpiece, and wiggle it back and forth while lowering the tool; use increments of 0.05 mm when you are close, and stop the moment the tool pinches the foil. Set the Z origin in that location; oh, and try not to pinch your hand instead! Done? Well, in that case, it's time to put on safety glasses, perhaps put several dabs of cutting oil in the region to be cut, and then hit "send" and output the 3 mm roughing and finishing toolpaths to the machine. With any luck, several minutes later, the machining process should be wrapped up. Vacuum off a bit and inspect the result; is the shape in line with what we're expecting? If yes, let's fix the kink: install the 1 mm tool, check TIR, redo the tool height measurement (very important), and hit "send" to output the remaining toolpath on your list. In case you are wondering, there are very few things that can go wrong with the cutting process itself, and all of them should be fairly self-explanatory. For example, if the machine starts cutting at an unexpected location, or too high / too low in relation to the workpiece, you probably messed up setting the origins, selecting the right coordinate system, or had the CAM model positioned incorrectly. Similarly, if the tool breaks while cutting in the expected location, this is probably due to grossly incorrect RPM, feed speed, or cut-in depth; or bad ordering of toolpaths. But chances are, you won't run into any issues just yet, so sit back and relax! Note: as hinted earlier, for more complex jobs, it's useful to keep the roughing end mill and the finishing cutter separate, even if both processes call for the same diameter of the tool. This way, you don't have to worry about the loss of micron-scale accuracy as the roughing end mill begins to wear - and you will be able to use both tools for a lot longer. As soon as you're done, detach the mold and vacuum in thoroughly. Machinable wax sometimes requires a gentle but firm cleaning with a brush and a touch of compressed air to get rid of the somewhat sticky chips - so do that, and then have a closer look. Is the surface silk smooth? Do you see any pronounced tool marks or gouges on vertical surfaces? What about horizontal ones? Do the dimensions check out when you use a caliper? (In more complex projects, pin gage sets are useful for measuring the diameter of small holes, too.) Chances are, you're in good shape - but if anything is even slightly wrong, now would be the right time to track the problem down; don't wait until you're working on more time-consuming projects, or in less forgiving materials. Here are several causes of the problems you are most likely to see: Tool ploughing through an essential part of the geometry: this may be due to poorly configured toolpaths; failure to adjust Z origin after tool change; axis stepper motor overload in open-loop machines; or sending a cutting job while the tool is positioned below the top of the workpiece (not all CAM applications prefix the generated toolpath with an instruction to retract the cutter). Double-check that the workpiece is still properly attached, too. Significant dimensional inaccuracy: this is usually caused by incorrectly specified tool diameter, excessive TIR, misaligned spindle axis, incorrectly secured workpiece, or poor mill calibration. The last problem will be directly proportional to the size of the machined feature, and if so, can be measured and compensated for in software. Substantial tool marks or gouges: these defects are typically due to high TIR, excessive speeds, or high chip loads during finishing (e.g., due to incorrect choice of toolpaths). Sometimes, lowering RPM is all you need. Very poor overall appearance of the mold: this may be due to unsuitable stock material (e.g., certain types of soft, malleable thermoplastics); using a bent or chipped tool; using a drill instead of an end mill; or having the workpiece partly detach from the table in the middle of the cutting job. Still, in all likelihood, the result will be fine. If that's the case, let's wrap up by reviewing some common-sense rules that come handy in mold design, just so that you are well-equipped to work on your next CNC project - and then, let's cast a mold. There are relatively few real constraints on what you can cut on your milling machine, but there are several simple design strategies you should follow to keep the cutting process simple and quick, and make accurate, durable, and dimensionally accurate molds. Here's the gist of it: To speed up toolpath calculations, always choose straight lines over arcs when you can. For example, you may want to opt for simple, manually drawn shapes for mold cavities, or use chamfering instead of filleting to provide reliefs in places where aesthetics do not matter. This keeps the resulting 3D mesh a lot simpler, and can dramatically improve the speed of CAM work. To simplify the cutting process, it's good to maintain a reasonably consistent margin between each of the parts inside the mold, and between parts and the walls of the mold cavity. Use a distance that is slightly higher than the diameter of the tool entered for the roughing process. To help with waterline cutting, it's useful to align most of the vertical features present in the mold to 0.5 mm or so. This minimizes the need for selective remachining of individual parts. When dealing with parts of vastly different part heights, it may be desirable to create several separate mold cavities, instead of trying to cram everything into a single one. Using a shallow cavity for all the small parts will often save you time and materials. It's preferable to avoid holes and slots that have a size exactly matching the diameter of the tool that will be used to cut them; due to rounding errors, such situations can confuse your CAM software, and make it hard to generate a valid toolpath. Allowing at least 1% wiggle room is a good idea. Any small, deep holes that reach the very bottom of the master pattern should have their depth reduced by about 0.1 mm. This eliminates the risk that the resulting protrusion of the flexible negative mold will rub against the top cover used in the casting process, and deflect. The resulting 0.1 mm film is very easy to remove from the final part. You need to allow some headroom between the top of the mold cavity, and the top of the tallest part laid out on the inside; this forms the bottom surface of the resulting negative mold. Allowance of around 2-3 mm is usually OK. Deep molds (over 10-15 mm or so) benefit from draft angles on their outer walls (a slight slant, created using the offset and loft operators). Introducing several 5 mm deep pull tabs on the edges of the mold may be helpful, too. Large-volume parts should use molds that are scaled up accordingly, and have more generous margins and headroom, to support the weight of the resin and the mold itself. Well, that's it. It may sound overwhelming, but once you catch a whiff of it, even remarkably complex multi-part molds are fairly easy to crank out. We'll cover this and several other advanced design topics later on - but for now, let's have some fun with polymers! As discussed in section 1.3 of this guide, resin casting is a pretty amazing, simple, and user-friendly process that comes equally handy in CNC prototyping, 3D printing, and in manual DIY work; all its sophisticated uses aside, you will end up using it to replace broken parts in appliances or toys, make unique gifts, or even encapsulate backyard flowers or bugs (don't deny it). Alas, the online market for moldmaking and casting supplies is dominated by several companies that cater chiefly to artistic users, and sell expensive products with poor mechanical properties and little utility in high-precision engineering work. In that spirit, even if you are familiar with artistic resin casting using epoxies, polyester resins, or polyurethanes from Alumilite, Smooth-On, and similar sources, you will be probably surprised by how much better your results can get. Well, before we dive into the world of casting resins, we should briefly revisit the choice of materials you can use to make master patterns. This part of this chapter is specific to projects that rely on CNC milling, so if you are interested in replicating manually crafted or 3D printed parts, you may want to skip ahead a page or two (this site provides a good overview of how to build patterns by hand - and if you have any other questions, feel free to drop me a mail or stop by /r/resincasting). Still here? All right! Of course, milling machines are not particularly fussy, and will cut almost anything that is softer than tungsten carbide, but rigid enough to stay in one place; still, some materials are more predictable than others, and produce better results. Prime choices include rigid engineering plastics such as polyurethane, epoxy, polyester, ABS, polyamide (Nylon), or acetal (Delrin); many varieties of hard woords; aluminum, brass, and other soft metals and alloys; and more exotic choices such as printed circuit boards, hard waxes, plaster, etc. Conversely, common materials that machine with greater difficulty or offer sub-par surface finish include stringy, low-melt thermoplastics (PET, polycarbonate, some grades of polyethylene); rubbers and other stretchy or squishy polymers (including some grades of PVC and most polystyrene foams); plywood and particle boards (including MDF); and exceptionally hard or highly abrasive stuff, such as steel, stone, or glass. Of course, many of these materials can be still cast or formed using CNC-machined molds and dies. Poor choice of working materials is one of the most common mistakes made by hobbyist machinists; quite a few people stick to workpieces that offer poor accuracy, get damaged easily, gum up the tool, or simply cost way too much. For moldmaking purposes, your best bet is one of the little-known materials: an extremely accurate, low cost piece of plastic known as a medium-density modelling board, originally devised for the automotive industry. It's essentially a mix of medium strength polyurethane, and a combination of soft fillers such as calcium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide. There are many types of machinable boards, but the one we are interested in has a density of about 0.70-0.78 g/cm³, and vaguely resembles wood: Prototyping boards of this particular variety include Huntsman RenShape 460 (or sligthly less dense BM 5460), Axson ProLab 65, Sika SikaBlock M700, BCC MB2001, Necuron Necumer 651, and several more. The material is typically sold in bulk, in sheets of about 50 x 150 cm, 25 mm thick. This may sound like a lot, but I recommend buying a full board, rather than grossly overpriced cut-to-size bits. The material lasts me for about a year, and costs about $12 per liter (roughly $250 for the whole thing). It's much less than what you'd pay for a similar slab of HDPE or acrylic - and it machines easier, too. (Planks of dense hard wood, when glued together and planed, may be a cheaper alternative for uncomplicated parts.) Buying prototyping boards is actually pretty easy. If you are in the US, you can simply go to Freeman Supply, and order RenShape 460 online (search for item #075229). In other places, simply look at the manufacturers' websites and find local distributors, then send out several e-mails or make some calls (online ordering isn't common in the industrial world). Be aware that prices may vary significantly, so shop around. Alongside with the board, you may want to order a matching board repair putty; it's a fast-curing, polyester compound that can be used to fix minor damage to your molds, or even completely fill a previously created cavity to reuse a particular workpiece for a new project. If you are ordering online with Freeman, go with their Quik-Fil; otherwise, ask the distributor for a matching product - they will be able to advise. What else? Oh, about the only minor drawback of the medium-density boards is that they have a very fine but perceptible grain, as shown in this magnified image: This grain normally has no appreciable effect on dimensional accuracy, but imparts a satin finish that will transfer to any transparent, water-clear parts. Of course, you can create high-gloss molds by coating the pattern with paste wax or a similar sealer (carnauba wax is particularly good); or you can always simply polish the final part - but both these options affect dimensional accuracy, and can be annoying when working on complex molds. The alternative is to use a more expensive material known as a tooling board - made out of solid, dense polyurethane, with no perceptible grain. Boards such as RenShape 5169 or BM 5272 cost up to 50% more, need to be machined 20-40% slower, and cause some wear to the tool - but they scratch this particular itch. Note: RenShape 460 is relatively easy to cut with a hand saw; in fact, it's comparable to soft woods. That said, the extra labor may be annoying in the long haul, so it makes sense to have a decent jigsaw nearby. You can get one for around $35; blades designed for hard woods will cut the material very quickly and last for years. In order to replicate the parts laid out inside your pattern cavity, you need a flexible and durable substance to take an impression of the desired shape, and use it as a mold for the final product of your work. There are several types of castable rubbers that could be useful for this purpose, but silicones are hard to beat. There are quite a few formulations that combine ease of use, excellent mechanical properties, perfect dimensional accuracy, no odor, no toxicity, and temperature resistance up to 300° C. On top of that, silicones come with an inherently non-stick surface, which helps greatly in casting work. Almost all the silicone formulations you can find on the market come as a viscous goo consisting of long, linear, partly polymerized chains of siloxanes; that nominally non-reactive soup is then combined with a suitable cross-linker and a catalyst. The reaction between these components quickly turns the goo into a very bouncy solid; this can be initiated in several ways: Room temperature vulcanizing, one component rubber (RTV-1): these substances undergo hydrolysis when exposed to atmospheric humidity. This reaction creates unstable molecules that promptly bind to each other, and release acetic acid or a simple alcohol as a byproduct (hence the trademark smell of the silicone sealants from a hardware store). This reaction, known as condensation polymerization, has the unfortunate effect of subtly affecting dimensional accuracy of the part - simply due to the release of volatile molecules. That said, the main reason why this process isn't popular for moldmaking is more prosaic: it's just that thicker layers take forever to set, owing to their limited exposure to air. High-temperature vulcanizing silicones (HTV): here, condensation polymerization occurs in presence of free radicals, which are liberated from a heated organic peroxide. The suitable curing temperature hovers around 100-150° C. This method is sweet and simple, but also has a fatal side effect: the coefficient of thermal expansion for silicones is pretty high, around 0.025%/°C - and so, after cooling down, the dimensions will be off by several percent. This makes HTV rubbers completely useless for precision work. (It is possible to use radiation or UV light instead of heat, but that's not very practical in most cases.) Room temperature, two-component rubber (RTV-2): Condensation cure: these rubbers polymerize at room temperature in presence of an organotin compound (typically dibutyltin dilaurate), which is mixed into the system shortly before pouring it all into a mold. The catalyst itself is fairly harmful, has a characteristic smell, and will leach out of the rubber in small amounts. Tin-cured silicones are popular in hobby work, but I don't recommend them; organotin aside, they exhibit measurable shrinkage (around 0.5%), have inferior mechanical properties, and are prone to cure reversal after 1-2 years or so. Addition cure: these silicones are catalyzed with a platinum complex, and polymeryze with no byproducts whatsoever. The materials are safe and odor-free, and the finished product has practically no shrinkage, exhibits superb mechanical characteristics, and can be stored indefinitely. Platinum cure rubbers are commonly used in medical and food handling applications, and are the prime choice for flexible molds. In other words, you almost certainly want to stick to RTV-2 platinum-catalyzed silicones, unless you are working on life-sized castings (at that point, the cost of silicone can become prohibitive). Before discussing specific products, let's have a quick look at the notable characteristics that will come up in product datasheets for these rubbers, and review their significance to our work: Stiffness: the rubber we are going to use needs to be flexible enough to allow easy demolding of finished parts, but must be sufficiently rigid to maintain dimensional accuracy when laid on a flat surface, filled with liquid resin, and clamped or weighed down until the plastic is fully cured. There is no single, consistently advertised parameter that would give you a good idea of how flexible a particular rubber is, but this can be inferred in two relatively simple ways: Indentation hardness: this parameter is measured using an ad hoc scale known as "Shore A", named so after its inventor. The test involves pressing a flat-tipped 0.8 mm needle into a sample with a modest force (800 gf). Deflection of 2.5 mm or more corresponds to 0 on the scale, while no deflection whatsoever is denoted with the value of 100. Indentation hardness is a relatively poor proxy for rigidity, but is the primary key by which silicones are sorted in any catalog. In general, silicones under 10 Shore A are jello-like, and are used chiefly for special effects, soft bicycle seats, and - why not - sex toys. Compositions around 20-40A are fairly stretchy and squishy, similar to a rubber band. Silicones around 60-80A are still flexible, but begin to resemble a pencil eraser or a tire - you can flex them, but you won't stretch them easily. What to buy: rubbers starting from 20 Shore A are marketed as suitable for moldmaking, but I strongly recommend using around 60A for small, dimensionally accurate molds; rubbers under 40 Shore A are not advisable, except for large-scale work or for certain manual moldmaking techniques. Tensile strength vs elongation at break: if you need a more accurate picture of flexibility, looking at these values is a better approach - especially when comparing silicones to other types of rubber-like elastomers that we'll talk about soon. In essence, tensile strength tells you the stress (force divided by the area of cross-section) that causes the material to either snap, or to develop a localized defect known as necking. Elongation at break, on the other hand, describes the extent to which a standardized specimen can be stretched before breaking apart. If you divide tensile strength expressed as MPa (1 MPa = 145 psi) by elongation at break expressed as a ratio (1 + elongation / 100%), you will get a somewhat arbitrary but useful value that will be low for squishy rubbers, and high for rigid ones. (There is also a proper way to measure stiffness - Young's modulus - but it's not very commonly seen in silicone datasheets.) What to buy: unless you are working with very large or very deep molds, try to select a rubber where this calculated "stiffness coefficient" is at least 2 MPa. Ratios up to 3 MPa are OK for most uses; values around 4 MPa make sense only for relatively shallow molds where dimensional accuracy is paramount. Tear strength: removing cured parts from the mold inevitably involves some non-uniform pulling in the vicinity of sharp corners and other tight spots. In these cases, tensile strength does not accurately describe the resilience of the molding material; tear strength testing, which involves pulling a sample apart near the edge, offers a much better insight. The test used in the States is usually ASTM D624 die B, which involves a sample nicked with a razor; in Europe, a different method, similar to ASTM D624 die C, is more popular. There is no general mapping between these tests, but for moldmaking silicones specifically, the results given by the European approach (BS903 part A3) tend to be 30% lower or so. What to buy: tear strength of at least around 15-20 kN/m, as per ASTM method, is highly desirable (the value corresponds to force divided by the thickness of the sample; 1 kN/m = 5.7 ppi). Formulations up to 30 kN/m are available on the market, and are certainly not a waste of money. It's best to stay away from products where the advertised tear strength less than 12 kN/m or so. Mixed viscosity: rheology of a liquid is a complex topic and remains very difficult to fully parametrize, but within a single family of products, formulations with lower dynamic viscosity are generally easier to mix, pour, and degas - and will be more inclined to conform to complex shapes without the aid of vacuum or pressure. Silicone rubbers suitable for moldmaking start around 10,000 mPa*s; this viscosity resembles a runny syrup, and is very easy to work with. Compositions that go over 35,000 mPa*s or so are more prone to air entrapment when mixing the components, and when pouring them into a mold; the use of vacuum degassing is advisable for any complex work. Finally, once you cross 100,000 mPa*s, almost any silicone becomes fairly painful to work with. What to buy: all other things being roughly equal, go with the system with the lowest viscosity. Products below 50,000 mPa*s are advisable, but not strictly a must. Pot life and demold time: RTV-2 formulations begin to polymeryze the moment you mix the two components together; the point at which it the mix becomes so thick that it is no longer free-flowing or self-leveling is known as pot life or gel time. In the same vein, the point at which it is sufficiently cross-linked to be safe to remove from the master is referred to as demold time. Both of these values must be chosen so that the product can be worked with at a reasonable pace. What to buy: pot life of around 30 minutes in the bare minimum for low viscosity compositions; for medium and high viscosity, 50-90 minutes is preferable, because every step of the casting process will take a bit longer. Demold time should be as short as possible; I'd stay clear of any formulations that require more than 24 hours to set. Note: the speed of this and many other chemical reactions roughly doubles with every 10° C. If you are in a rush and don't care about some minor thermal expansion, using moderate heat is a great way to have your molds ready in 2-3 hours or so. Shrinkage: addition cure silicones used for moldmaking purposes should have no measurable shrinkage. Some manufacturers simply say "none", while others say "less than 0.1%" or so. Seeing a higher value in the datasheet is a warning sign; shrinkages between 0.2% and 0.6% are commonly seen in condensation cure silicones, and should be avoided in precision work. Color: moldmaking silicones are usually opaque beige in their virgin state, and can be pigmented easily. Systems in such a neutral color come handy if you wish to use the rubber not only for molds, but also to make functional parts (tires, etc). Sadly, many of the moldmaking compositions are artificially dyed blue, red, or green, to help novice users mix the components properly. That aside, there are several silicone formulations that are nearly transparent. The product is never water clear, and will have a slight milky haze; it will also lose transparency if exposed to high temperatures. Because of this, it's not particularly suitable for decorative purposes, but can be indispensable for non-CNC replication work, where you often need to see the submerged master part, and carefully cut the mold to recover it. The major downside of transparent silicones is that they have somewhat different flow characteristics, and can be difficult to degas. What to buy: I would not consider color to be the most important factor - if necessary, polyurethane elastomers offer a good alternative for making functional parts. That said, if you have a choice, it certainly doesn't hurt to go with something that can be pigmented easily. All right, that's it! Other parameters are either uninteresting, or are not advertised consistently. To help you with the selection process, my top recommendations for mechanical projects would be: Best overall properties: Quantum Silicones QM 262. This is a pale blue, opaque rubber with low viscosity (35,000 mPa*s), hardness around 65A, 12 hour demold time, and high strength. Hobby Silicone is a reputable distributor, so give them a try. In Europe and some other markets, Bluestar Silicones RTV 3460 is a decent, but considerably more viscous, alternative. Transparent / pigmentable: Silicones Inc P-592 (formerly known as XP-592). Truly exceptional tear strength, good price, medium viscosity (50,000 mPa*s), hardness in the vicinity of 60 Shore A, more challenging to degas. Cures in about 12 hours. You can order this product through Innovative Polymers, along with some of the other items we'll cover in the next section. High rigidity: Quantum Silicones QM 270, also sold as ACC Silicones QM270 in Europe. Neutral beige or turquoise rubber around 75 Shore A, excellent mechanical properties and manageable viscosity (50,000 mPa*s). Remains easy to degas. Somewhat less suitable for deep molds, undercuts, and in other applications requiring a stretchy material - but its great for small, high-precision parts. Super-low viscosity: Quantum Silicones QM 237. Around 40 Shore A, very easy to mix and pour (10,000 mPa*s), properties are still acceptable for typical molds. If you live in Europe, you may want to check out ACC Silicones MM242, which is pretty similar and comes in a transparent variety. You should pick just one of these; if you're undecided, go with QM 262 or P-592. If you need other options... well, Silicones Inc and Quantum are the most interesting US-based companies I know of. Other choices include Polytek, GT Products, BJB, and Smooth-On - but in my opinion, their selection is much less impressive, and the options I have tried pale in comparison with the ones mentioned on the recommended list. US market aside, globally, Bluestar Silicones (Rhodia) is fairly ubiquitous; you may also want to check out ShinEtsu, Wacker, Zhermack, Huntsman, Axson, or Dow Corning - depending on where you are located, they all offer some interesting choices. But then, one reader living in Norway reported that placing an international order with Hobby Silicone for QM 262 actually turned out to be much cheaper than locally available alternatives (whoa). As far as pricing goes, platinum cure silicones cost around $35-$45/liter when bought in one liter cans, or about $30-$35/liter in 4-5 liter pails; for example, P-592 costs around $120 for 4 l, while QM 270 and QM 262 in 5 l quantities fetch $140 and $170, respectively. Unreacted liquids should survive at least 2-3 years without significant deterioration, as long as you keep them in tightly closed containers, away from sunlight, moisture, and excess heat - so getting a full pail is not a bad idea. Note: resin manufacturers in the States use a somewhat confusing scheme for describing the size of their two-component kits: "1 gallon kit" usually means that you are getting about one gallon of whichever component is needed in greater quantity; and a matching amount of the other one. If the mix ratio is 10:1 (as is the case with most platinum cure silicones), the gain is minimal - but for resins mixed 1:1, you are actually buying two gallons or so. To further confuse you, the same does not apply to sizes specified in pounds - "15 lbs" means that you are getting just enough to cast a 15 lbs blob of plastic or rubber. Be sure to account for these differences when shopping around: a lower price is not always a better deal. All right, let's talk about the materials you can employ to actually make final parts! Polyurethanes are an incredibly interesting and versatile class of two-component, addition cure polymers. They use two principal reagents, mixed in comparable quantities: a non-volatile isocyanate and a complex alcohol (polyol). Some formulations trade some or all of the polyol for a polyetheramine, resulting in a material that is more properly called a polyurea. In any case, the two components are usually combined with variable amounts of chain modifiers, usually chemically similar to the primary polyol; and possibly surfactants, plasticizers, fillers, and so on. The whole thing is then catalyzed with a wide variety of organometallic compounds (bismuth, zinc, tin, zirconium, aluminum, or similar); with tertiary amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO / TEDA); with diazoles such as 1,2-dimethylimidazole (DMI); or with something pretty close to that. Modern polyurethane chemistry lets you manufacture everything from soft foams, to high-performance rubbers, to faithful, often superior imitations of many other rigid engineering plastics - all that without having to go bankrupt on injection molding equipment, and while using only fairly safe and predictable chemicals. They greatly outperform more familiar resins, such as epoxies or polyesters, and in hobbyist workshops, are much less dangerous to work with. The only downside of high-performance polyurethane systems is that they generally require a basic vacuum rig - a small pump and a suitable container to remove any dissolved gases from the mix. Products that do not require degassing are readily available, but usually don't perform as well as their peers. (We'll talk about the required harware later on, but it's pretty compact and doesn't cost a lot.) Anyway - if you are aiming to make functional prototypes, it is probably prudent to start by stocking up on a polyurethane resin that lets you produce hard, rigid, and shock-resistant parts. Once more, let's have a look at some of the key things worth highlighting in a datasheet: Stated purpose: there is a lot of variety in the world of polyurethanes, and not all the properties of a material can accurately captured with several cold, dry numbers alone. You should always pay attention to what the manufacturer is trying to tell you: if they are talking about simulating engineering plastics such as ABS, polyamide, or polyolefins - great. If they are instead paying undue attention to tooling fixtures, conceptual prototypes, scale models, etc, be wary. This may mean that the resin has disproportionately low strength in thin sections, is very brittle, or suffers from other malady. If in doubt, simply talk to them and clarify. For the same reason, tread carefully if the resin is designated strictly for meter-mix machines, vacuum assisted casting equipment, or something of that sort. It may mean that the material is very difficult to degas, has an annoyingly short pot life, or requires a heated mold. That label is not always a problem, but 75% of the time, it's there for a reason. As usual, when in doubt, ask. It's often also possible to get a sample and try it out yourself. Hardness: indentation hardness of rigid plastics is typically measured using a scale called "Shore D". This approach is very similar to the one used for rubbers, except that it relies on a sharper tip (0.1 mm) and a greater force (4,500 g). Indentation hardness doesn't necessarily map to rigidity, or any other useful property - but since it's always listed prominently, use it as a very rough selection criteria: plastics under 75 Shore D are unlikely to be strong enough for making thin-walled parts. Flexural properties: almost all the prototyping work you may end up doing will probably benefit from a plastic that withstands high bending forces without snapping in half; and that maintains as much rigidity as possible under such a load. These qualities are measured using two values: flexural strength and flexural modulus. The first one describes the force in relation to part dimensions at which a standardized specimen breaks; the other one tells you the ratio between the stress the material is under, and its degree of deformation. The higher it is, the more rigid the part will seem. In comparison to these two, compressive and tensile properties usually matter a lot less in small-scale prototyping work. What to buy: aim high. Look for flexural strength around 90-120 MPa, and for flexural modulus somewhere between 2.5 and 3.1 GPa. This is roughly comparable or better than tough materials such as ABS (Lego bricks), polyamide (plastic gears), polycarbonate (CDs and DVDs), or acrylic glass. For a comparison of common plastics, this website is a great starting point. Impact resistance: flexural strength of a polymer is important, but doesn't paint a complete picture. For example, polypropylene is a relatively flimsy plastic, with flexural strength less than 40% that of acrylic glass; yet, Tupperware made out of PP easily survives being dropped to the floor, while acrylic glass of the same thickness and shape would likely shatter right away. The difference is that, especially in thin sections, polypropylene has a much better ability to flex and dissipate the energy of a localized shock; this is usually measured using a test known as notched Izod impact strength, where a pendulum swings and breaks an upward-facing, notched sample in its path; the test estimates the energy lost by the pendulum, in proportion of the thickness of the specimen (minus the depth of the notch). Lo and behold - the strength of acrylic glass is barely 15 J/m (1 J/m = 0.0187 ft-lbs/in), while various grades of polypropylene vary between 100 and 300 J/m. Impact strength matters more often than you might expect. For example, tiny gears subjected to sudden torque variations when braking will be more prone to failing catastrophically if the material has poor resistance to such shocks. Most rigid polyurethanes have Izod impact strength around 30-50 J/m, resembling Nylon, polystyrene, and so forth: they will perform well, but if you step on a medium size, very thin-walled part, it will probably break. There are quite a few formulations closer to 100-300 J/m, resembling plastics such as ABS; if you ever stepped on a Lego brick, you probably know that it prevails, at the expense of your foot. What to buy: your primary resins used for functional prototypes should have impact strength of at least 30 J/m; if the value is not provided by the manufacturer, it's probably lower than that. You typically don't need much higher figures, but if you have a choice, getting something closer to 100 J/m doesn't hurt. Shrinkage: this parameter is somewhat important in polyurethanes, because in some circumstances, it may significantly affect the dimensions of your parts. Alas, the standardized test is essentially meaningless. Polyurethane polymerization reaction has virtually no inherent shrinkage, but can be fairly exothermic; thermal expansion of the liquid, and the response of the flexible mold that surrounds it, is what may mess up the final result. In general, coefficient of thermal expansion for rigid polyurethanes is about five times lower than that of silicone (perhaps 0.005%/°C); when using sensibly selected resins, the exotherm in thin parts will not exceed 5-10° C above room temperature, and the resulting shrinkage will be practically nil, no matter what the datasheet says. On the flip side, when dealing with parts that have thick cross-sections, the temperature may peak 50° C over ambient - and at that point, dimensional accuracy in the most easily deflected portion of the mold will suffer. For example, when casting a solid block of resin with dimensions of 10 x 10 x 30 mm, and using a sealed rubber mold and a resin with 10 minute pot life, the most vulnerable point in the mid-section of the mold may be off by as much as 0.3 mm (3%). The rest of the part will be probably spot on. Luckily, it is within your power to change this. We'll talk about this in more detail later on, but in essence, you can: Slow down the reaction. The boring option is to switch to a system with a pot life of 30-50 minutes, and overnight cure - as these will usually have negligible exotherm even for bulkier castings. The more exciting option is to get rid of some of the catalyst present in the product, which usually involves adding a common and reasonably safe chemical to the system. It's simpler than it sounds. Partly prepolymerize the resin. Pre-mixing the full amount of isocyanate with about 10-20% of the intended amount of polyol, and setting this mixture aside for about an hour or two, will minimize the exotherm later on, likely reducing shrinkage by 70-90%. This has several other benefits, too, and the only side effect is increased viscosity. Add an inert filler to act as a moderator. Well-chosen additives allow you to reduce shrinkage by at least 30% without significantly compromising flexural properties of the system; going up to 80-90% is possible if you are willing to make some performance trade-offs. Allow some extra resin to flow back into the mold as the system cools down. Adding sprues or vents allows shrinkage to be offset without deforming the mold, and can result in dimensional accuracy improved by 80% or more. Cast in several layers. This eliminates shrinkage almost completely, but works well only with relatively simple shapes. The approaches can be combined, often with synergistic results. It is also possible to let shrinkage happen, but direct it toward non-essential locations; this can be accomplished by intentionally weakening a section of the mold, for example by using thin walls. The bottom line is that you don't have to worry a lot - but you need to be aware of this behavior, and need to know how to reduce it when necessary. What to buy: all in all, don't read too much into the datasheet, but be wary of resins with very high stated shrinkage - unless that shrinkage is measured by the manufacturer for a sample that is cured at an elevated temperature. For samples that spend the first few hours or days at room temperature, advertised shrinkage should be less than 0.3% or so. Beyond that, comparisons are somewhat pointless. Mixed viscosity: flow characteristics of polyurethanes are very different from silicones, possibly due to higher surface tension; on top of that, polyurethanes usually have much shorter pot life. Because of that, resins under 1,000 mPa*s are preferred; products over 2,000 mPa*s or so will be more challenging to degas and pour - and venturing past 4,000 mPa*s should be done at own risk. The parameter is not critical, but it's good to avoid extremes. Pot life and demold time: many polyurethanes will have fairly short pot life, between 30 seconds and 4 minutes. That's usually not enough for manual casting, unless you are doing something very simple. Around 7-8 minutes is highly advisable for low viscosity resins, and closer to 10-15 minutes makes sense for when dealing with resins over 1,500 mPa*s or so. As for demold time, it is usually preferable to keep it short; between 2 and 6 hours is ideal, as it lets you crank out multiple batches in a single day. That said, overnight cure (12-24 hours) is not the end of the world. Any slow-curing resin can be accelerated in a simple way, and we'll cover that a few sections down. Presence of fillers: some resins are pre-mixed with fillers to improve their flexural properties, abrasion resistance, or fire rating. In general, don't go there unless you are sure that you can't approximate this effect by manually adding the appropriate filler, and that you want to be permanently stuck with all the drawbacks (e.g., higher viscosity, lower impact strength, and the tendency for fillers to settle in storage). Color: avoid dyed or non-pigmentable resins. Transparent, translucent, neutral white, and slightly off-white resins (light beige, lightly straw-colored, etc) can be usually easily pigmented to your liking. Colors such as amber, caramel, or tan are more of a gamble; ask for a photo or a sample of the material to determine how bad it really is. Some of these colors are faint and easily overcome, and some are there to stay. Compatibility with platinum-cure silicones: there is a small number of transparent resins or other specialty formulations may be inhibited by the platinum catalyst present in silicone molds. Always scan the datasheet for any mentions of that risk. If it's not mentioned, you are good to go. All right, ready for some recommendations? Here we go: Best all-around resin: Innovative Polymers IE-3075. Really, nothing else comes close. Translucent, high-strength plastic with a reasonable pot life (8 minutes) and quick demold time (2-3 hours for smaller parts). Around 83 Shore D, flex strength 120 MPa, modulus 2.9 GPa, decent impact resistance. Very low cost - around $17 per liter. The system can be slowed down in a simple way if you need a longer cure time or lower exotherm. A good fallback option in the US and several other markets is BJB Enterprises TC-854 A/B, which is about 15% less rigid and cures a tad faster, but is otherwise indistinguishable from IE-3075 and costs about the same. The other US choice is Huntsman RenCast 6591, but it has noticably shorter pot life, is harder to pigment, and costs much more. For those of you in Europe, RenCast 5146 (also sold as RenPIM 5219) is a very similar, low-cost resin. This one has a pot life of around 30 minutes, and requires overnight cure (unless you add some extra catalyst). There are some distributors for BJB products in the EU, too, so you may also have luck with TC-854 A/B. Water clear: Innovative Polymers OC-5274 or OC-5086. Like other mercury-free compositions, these are sensitive to moisture in thin layers. When making small castings in single-part molds, you may end up getting relatively low yields unless you preheat the mold, perform pressure casting, or add a small amount of a separately purchased catalyst (see section 4.4.4). The price of the resins is relatively steep, around $45 per liter. High-impact plastic: Innovative Polymers TP-4052. This product is fairly similar to IE-3075 in most aspects. Flexural parameters are somewhat worse, but impact strength is almost three times higher. Price is in the vicinity of $30 per liter. Note that as opposed to IE-3075, I have not found a way to slow this system down when low shrinkage in mass casting is desired. At this point, unless you have a specific itch to scratch, it's perfectly OK to order just IE-3075 directly from IPI. Their "1 gallon kit" (actually around 6.5 l) sells for about $110. "Quart kits" are also available if you need to try it out first. If you want to shop around, I don't think it makes sense to look beyond Innovative Polymers - not if you're in the States; they have a remarkable selection of unique, user-friendly products designed specifically for manual casting, and great customer service. They take direct orders, and also have several local distributors. If you're skeptical, you can have a look at products from Smooth-On, Alumilite, BJB Enterprises, or Freeman - but you will not find anything that even comes close to that selection. If you are in Europe, checking out Huntsman and Axson is not a bad plan. As with silicones, polyurethane resins are pretty stable and have a fairly long shelf life - but they are fairly sensitive to sunlight, humidity, heat, oxygen, and moisture. It is a good practice to buy several 100-250 ml polypropylene or HDPE bottles (example) for intermediate storage of the amounts of resin you plan to use within a month or so - and keep the original containers sealed and blanketed with inert gas. The inert gas can be just a burst of "canned air" (difluoroethane or tetrafluoroethane), but if you want to save money in the long haul and have some room in your workshop, it makes more sense to invest around $150 in a small nitrogen tank, a regulator, and a hose. This setup will last for months, and it's only about $10 to refill at a nearby Praxair location or so. In any case, if you store the resins properly, you can expect most of them to maintain their properties for at least 2-3 years; manufacturers usually give much more conservative guarantees, but take them with a grain of salt. Remember to agitate the containers if the components separate. Oh, some formulations may crystallize if kept below 10° C or so, but this process can be reversed easily. Prolonged storage in crystallized form is not advisable, as it may lead to the formation of insoluble dimers. Caution: although most of the polyurethane formulations you will encounter are reasonably safe, there are some unfortunate exceptions. We'll talk about this a bit more in chapter 7 - but for now, definitely watch out for: Volatile isocyanates: all isocyanates are dangerous if inhaled, but most of the prototyping formulations use prepolymers or monomers with negligible evaporation rates - so it would take serious effort to put yourself at risk (intentionally aerosolizing the resin would be one bad idea). In particular, MDI, HMDI / DMDI, and IPDI isocyanates are pretty safe. That said, some industrial resins use more volatile and more reactive compounds, such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) - and these are best avoided. Toxic catalysts: minutiae amounts of harmful organomercury salts, such as phenylmercuric neodecanoate, were found to be excellent, highly selective catalysts for polyurethanes; less concerning but still somewhat nasty tin(IV) compounds (e.g., dibutyltin dilaurate) offered some hard-to-replicate benefits, too. Needless to say, you probably want to avoid unnecessary risks. Such catalysts are largely phased out in favor of compounds of zinc, bismuth, tin(II), titanium, aluminum, and so on - but you can occasionally find them in products available in some markets (for example, Smooth-On, BJB, Alumilite, and Freeman still use them frequently). Possibly harmful amines: several amine curatives once-popular in certain high-performance elastomers - most notably 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA / MOCA) - were implicated as probably carcinogenic in humans. Be watchful for products that haven't switched to safer, modern alternatives. You won't find any of the problematic components in resins from Innovative Polymers - but other manufacturers sometimes show less restraint. Request and study material safety datasheets (MSDS) when in doubt. Flexible polyurethane elastomers are an interesting alternative to silicones. You don't necessarily need to buy any, but they may come handy if you wish to make functional rubber parts, and your silicone is not pigmentable, or has insufficient strength. Key advantages of these rubbers include 30-50% lower price, and much better performance toward the upper end of Shore A (above 40 or so): several times higher tear strength, much less pronounced tear propagation, excellent abrasion resistance, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, lower viscosity, and the ability to pigment the system as seen fit. On the flip side, polyurethanes exhibit some exotherm-caused shrinkage in larger castings, and adhere to many other plastics, making them less desirable for creating negative molds; they also tend to have slightly worse rebound characteristics, and limited temperature resistance (they get soft around 70-90° C, and deteriorate somewhere between 150 and 200° C - so casting low-melt metals, for example, is out of question). The parameters to look for in these compositions are similar to these for silicones, with the exception of pot life and viscosity - here, the advice provided for polyurethanes is more pertinent. When reviewing the datasheets, pay close attention to the ratio of tensile strength to elongation at break, because there can be striking differences in the rigidity of various products, especially those rated 70 Shore A or above; some of them are only somewhat flexible, and will not be suitable for making parts such as tires, rollers, or transmission belts. Note: This goes both ways: not all Shore A polyurethanes are particularly rubbery, and not all Shore D polyurethanes are necessarily very rigid. For example, some 60 Shore D polymers are highly elastic and can be stretched up to three times their original length, even though their surface feels hard as nails. They resemble the rubbers used in certain garden hoses, shopping cart wheels, etc. As for recommendations: you should go with Innovative Polymers HP-21xx series; I've tried quite a few other products, and nothing else comes close. They are relatively inexpensive ($25 per liter) and feature superb "true rubber" mechanical characteristics, long pot life, and good cure profiles. For example, HP-2170A is a super-stretchy 70 Shore A rubber with tear strength of 42 kN/m, far surpassing most silicones. There are also softer variants, down to 50 Shore A (HP-2150A); and more rigid but still surprisingly flexible ones, up to around 60 Shore D (HP-2160D). In fact, it's possible to blend them to achieve intermediate properties as needed for a particular project. All the products in the HP-21xx line take several days to polymerize at room temperature; if that's too slow and heating them up is not an option, you can add some separately purchased catalyst to get overnight cure with no real trade-offs. If you have dabbled in resin casting before, chances are, you used epoxy or styrene-based polyester resins, rather than polyurethanes. These options are popular with hobbyists because of their broad availability, low price, and less onerous processing requirements (i.e., less sensitivity to mixing ratios, moisture contamination, etc). That said, I think it's a bad idea to use these materials in precision casting work, for a couple of reasons: High shrinkage. Both polyesters and epoxies cure by condensation, and usually exhibit very high exotherm compared to polyurethanes with the same demold time. Shrinkage as high as 10% is common in unfilled polyesters; epoxies are better, but not dramatically so. Mold damage. Epoxies and polyesters use corrossive, oxidizing, or permeating components, and this reduces the service life of silicone molds quite a bit. It may be difficult to get 5-10 pulls out of a complex mold. Brittleness. Most epoxies and polyesters are designed to be cheap and to bond well, and not to have outstanding flexural parameters or impact strength. When superior characteristics are required, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or aramid cloth is typically used for reinforcement, but that's not very feasible for tiny, complex parts. Low UV resistance and clarity. Transparent epoxies and polyesters usually have lower clarity than water-clear polyurethanes, and are more prone to developing a yellow hue when exposed to sunlight. In comparison, many polyurethanes exhibit high UV stability. Workshop safety concerns. Components of a polyester resin are extremely volatile, flammable, and are an inhalation risk. Epoxies are more user-friendly, but use corrossive chemicals, and contain non-trivial amounts of bisphenol A. Bisphenol A hasn't been conclusively implicated in being harmful to humans, but is suspected of being an endocrine disruptor based on some subset of animal studies. Limiting your non-essential exposure may be a wise step. Of course, I don't want to demonize these polymers. Polyesters are sometimes useful for bonding and repair applications; and epoxies are extremely useful as high-performance glues and laminating or potting resins. Both epoxies and polyesters can be superior in lay-up composite applications, too, in part owing to their improved bonding capabilities. You can have a look at the products sold by Freeman Supply, or check out the low-cost, water-clear epoxies available from Polymer Composites Inc; just don't expect them to be a sensible match for PU for the processes discussed in this guide. Adding colors to your castings is fairly easy. One option is to find an artist store, and shop for dry, non-toxic organic pigments. Such pigments will work equally well with polyurethanes, silicones, and just about anything else - but may be relatively painful to disperse or to blend with any accuracy. The other choice is to purchase coloring pastes where pigments are already dispersed in a non-reactive (plasticizer) or reactive (polyol) medium - but these won't work in silicones. For dry pigments, Kremer is probably the best source online. For reactive dispersions, you can ping Innovative Polymers (send them your picks from this RAL chart); Eager Plastics has a pretty good selection of non-reactive pigments and dyes, too. Beyond that... selecting your palette is a matter of personal preferences, but here are some quick tips: Be sure to get some titanium-based white (Kremer 46200, IPI Bright White) and deep black (Kremer 47400, IPI Black 201). These two are used not only as standalone pigments, but are also useful as opacifiers for controlling transparency of the material, and the saturation produced by other dyes. When browsing artist stores, try to avoid most mineral-, plant-, and animal-based pigments; stick to modern synthetic dyes where possible. In particular, be wary of traditional products containing lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel. It's easy to go from vivid hues to muted ones, but not the other way round. Focus on punchy pigments with simple names; "Bohemian moonlight blue" is not what you need. You can't just buy three primary colors, and hope to make every other hue with that. It won't work, especially if you are aiming for a vibrant pallette. Aim to get at least 6-8 different, useful colors to begin with. Whatever you do, keep your pigments moisture-free. Store them in closed containers and in a dry place. If you need inspiration, here are some nice picks: Daylight fluorescent colors: Kremer has a line of day-glo pigments that result in extremely vivid colors that form translucent dispersions; Innovative Polymers carries a good selection, too. Basic opaque pigments: in addition to black and white, you may want to start with vibrant yellow (Kremer 55100, IPI Yellow 802), cyan (Kremer 55500, IPI Blue 303), pure red (Kremer 55300, IPI Bright Red), magenta (Kremer 55470, IPI Magenta), green (Kremer 55700, IPI Signal green), orange (Kremer 55200, IPI Orange 602). Transparent dyes: useful only if you are planning to make transparent or translucent parts. ORASOL dyes produce brilliant transparent colors, but pre-made dispersions from Eager Plastics are more convenient to use and have very high yields. Fancy pearlescent pigments: check out Paint With Pearl. Their prices are hard to beat. A small bag or bottle of a pigment will cost somewhere between $5 and $20, and should last for years. Tip: You can, of course, opt to paint your parts instead of adding pigments to the resin; acrylic and polyurethane lacquers can be used alike. For adding text or other ornamental elements to machined parts, you may also want to consider a low-cost vinyl cutter, such as Silhouette SD or Roland Stika SV-8. These devices are fairly affordable, and the results look amazingly good - especially if a layer of clear coat is applied on top. If another cutting machine is too much, you can also simply equip your CNC mill with a specialized drag knife to get comparable results. Adding colors aside, many other properties of cured plastics can be altered in profound ways by introducing certain easily available, low-cost additives. It's almost impossible to provide an exhaustive overview of all the available choices, but several use cases are definitely worth calling out: If you want to reduce shrinkage, there are many fillers that increase the distance between reactive molecules of the resin, slowing down the reaction and buffering some of the produced heat - but the ones that do so without significantly affecting viscosity or mechanical properties of the finished part are of particular interest. I found that 3M Scotchlite iM30K, a type of high-strength, hollow glass microspheres (less than 0.02 mm in diameter) works great when added at a ratio of about 4% by weight; when used in conjunction with the pre-mixing trick discussed earlier on, shrinkage is eliminated almost completely. When flexural properties are of utmost importance, tiny milled glass fibers, around 0.8 mm long, significantly reduce shrinkage at a radio between 10 and 30% by weight. Both of these fillers sell for less than $20 per liter. When you need to reduce weight, Scotchlite S15 can be added to any system at ratios as high as 3:1 by volume, resulting in a free-flowing resin with effective density less than 0.4 g/cm³. Compressive strength will be pretty reasonable, but flexural properties will suffer. This may come handy especially for hulls of model airplanes or boats. When you want an extremely hard plastic, the aforementioned variety of short glass fibers can substantially improve flexural strength, more than double flexural modulus, and significantly increase hardness and abrasion resistance - especially when used in conjunction with a silane coupling agent (see later on). Using longer or thicker fibers is a possibility, but may affect surface finish or complicate the casting process. For short fibers, ratios around 30% by weight are a good starting point. The downside of this trick is a significant reduction in impact strength; starting with a high-impact resin, such as TP-4052, may give you a bit more wiggle room. For improved impact strength, lower hardness, or lower viscosity, plasticizers can be introduced to the system to effectively add "padding" in the resulting polymer structure. Because they don't participate in the polymerization reaction, they reduce tensile strength and may increase creep (the tendency for the material to permanently deform under relatively minor but sustained load), but that trade-off is acceptable in many uses. For polyurethanes, one of the safer and more versatile plasticizers is dipropylene glycol dibenzoate (DPGDB), available from Eager Plastics under the name of EP9009. For silicones, any low-viscosity silicone oil will do; you can get it from the same source that you are purchasing the resin from. Plasticizer levels between 5 and 10% are common, although in silicone rubbers, up to 50% may be useful. You shouldn't have to pay more than $20-$40 per liter or so. To simulate select properties of metals: powdered metals, such as copper, aluminum, or iron, can be added to resins in significant amounts to increase their weight, thermal conductivity, and remarkably, give them a highly metallic appearance and feel when polished. You can find suitable 300-600 mesh metal powders on eBay or from sources such as ArtMolds. Prices vary, but aren't prohibitive. Flexural properties will suffer. Of course, multiple types of fillers can be combined; in particular, it may be useful to add some glass fibers to lightweight materials filled with hollow glass spheres, to maintain acceptable flexural strength. If you are wondering what to buy up front, it's not a completely bad plan to get some Scotchlite iM30K, plus 0.8 mm glass fibers, and a bit of DPGDB (also useful for preparing pigment dispersions and such). Other fillers are not nearly as essential. Now that we have the selection of resins, pigments, and fillers sorted out, it's time to briefly chat about the workshop equipment you will need to get the ball rolling. The list isn't particularly long, but even when it comes to something as inconsequential as mixing cups, making the wrong choice will unnecessarily complicate your life. Insufficient mixing may cause a range of problems with finished parts - but vigorous stirring will almost always introduce some air into the resin. This problem aside, bubbles of air may get trapped inside mold crevices as you pour the mixture in - even if your mixing skills are beyond reproach. Last but not least, some resins may simply liberate some amount of dissolved gases once the polymerization reaction begins; IE-3075 is an example of that. Vacuum degassing solves all these problems, and is not as scary as it may sound. Even if you are on a tight budget, you should get a low-cost vacuum pump capable of getting pulling around -1000 mbar of vacuum (that's about 10 mbar absolute, or -29.5 inches of mercury). I ordered mine from VIOT: click here for an entry-level model that sells for around $100, and should work fine; I have a $140 model with a higher flow rate, and it served me well. You will also need some sort of a vacuum chamber to hold the mixing container and the mold itself; it's possible to rig something together on your own, for example using a sturdy cooking pot and a cover made out of thick polycarbonate - but low-cost vacuum dessicator chambers work fine in that capacity, and start around $50 or so. If you are planning to work on relatively small projects, or opted for a pump with a relatiely low flow rate, Bel-Art #420100000 is a good choice; otherwise, model #420430000 will accommodate larger pieces, too. (For a bit more money, you can also find some good-looking purpose-built degassing chambers from several sellers on eBay.) About the only other piece of this puzzle is a hose to connect the pump with the chamber. I use 1/4" Kuriyama K7160 Polyspring, which I ordered from these guys; it's about $4 per meter. Other hoses can be used, too, but they need to be vacuum-rated, which in practice means that they need to be either fairly rigid, or reinforced with a metal spring to avoid collapsing as soon as you turn the pump on. Beyond that... well, getting some vacuum grease for o-rings and other parts of the vacuum chamber is not a bad plan (link); it also comes handy for several other purposes every now and then - for example, for preventing caps on resin bottles from seizing in storage. It goes without saying that for any sort of precision work, you need a reasonably well-equipped workshop to begin with. I am assuming that you already have that - and that basic tools such as clamps, needle files, or several grades of fine sanding paper, are always within reach. With that in mind, there are several less obvious, minor items that will be useful specifically when casting mechanical parts, and that we haven't mentioned before: Precision scale: observing proper mix ratios is extremely important for addition cure silicones - errors of as little as 2% may affect important properties of the rubber. Polyurethanes are a bit more tolerant, but it is important to stay within 4% or so. To that effect, in order to accurately mix components when working with relatively small quantities of resins (10-50 ml), you should try to get a scale with a resolution of at least 0.05 g, and measurement range of at least 0-200 g. You can get something usable for under $40 (I ordered from wholesale-scales.com, and can't complain). If you are watching your budget, you can also get away with a regular, gram-resolution kitchen scale - but in this case, you shouldn't attempt to mix less than about 30 ml of polyurethane, or 100 ml of silicone. In the long haul, this may be wasteful, depending on the size of your parts. Mixing containers: any plastic cup should do, but consider getting a box of one hundred 100 ml polypropylene beakers from Ted Pella or any other outlet with lab supplies; the price should be around 20 cents a piece ($20 per box). PP beakers are nearly indestructible, will not crack during mixing, will not melt when heated up, and will not fall apart when exposed to solvents. But perhaps most importantly, resins don't stick to them, so you can reuse the same cup over and over again. This actually leads to savings after a month or two of casting work! Mixing sticks: you can mix the resin with just about anything, as long as it's dry, clean, and has the right shape to reach all the spots inside the mixing cup. Many people use tongue depressors, which cost something around 1-2 cents a piece (try Ted Pella), and can be wiped clean and reused indefinitely. If you choose that option, just keep them away from moisture, and be sure to clip the business end to get a flat tip for better reach. Tongue depressors aside, chopsticks also work well, as do proper laboratory spatulas and flattened mixing sticks (link). The choice is yours. Freezer paper or thick aluminum foil: it's convenient to pour a bit extra resin into the mold, and let it overflow before sealing everything; this minimizes the risk of air entrapment. Any non-permeable, cheap material can be used to protect the surrounding working area against the overflowing resin; freezer paper and heavy-duty aluminum foil from a grocery store will do the trick. Deburring tools: there are several inexpensive hand tools that prove very useful for quickly cleaning up the thin film of resin that may be present around the mold's parting line, and for fixing other minor casting artifacts. I recommend grabbing one miniature swivel deburrer, such as Noga RB1000 ($8); one fixed-blade scraper, such as Noga SC8000 ($20); and perhaps a couple of small, hard Nylon brushes, such as this kit (already mentioned before). You can do without them, and just use a toothbrush, a pin, and a needle file - but your life will be a bit more difficult. Dental picks / wax carvers: a low-cost set of picks, hooks, and spatulas - something like this kit ($9) - will be extremely useful for removing silicone molds from masters, and for assorted other precision work. In fact, if you don't have that in your workshop already, you are missing out. Sheet polypropylene or HDPE: flat, smooth, non-stick plastics are useful for covering single-part molds to ensure dimensionally accurate and aesthetic castings. Polypropylene is the best choice, and you can get it in cut-to-size pieces from many sources, including Professional Plastics; HDPE is a second option, but it is less temperature-resistant, and it's more common to see warped sheets. In any case, get at least 15-20 cut-to-size pieces, around 1-3 mm thick, with dimensions corresponding to the scale of parts you are expecting to routinely make (10 x 15 cm is probably a good starting point). You can get individual larger pieces later on. Note: make sure that the material you are buying is machined to a flat, smooth surface; HDPE in particular is sometimes available in patterned varieties - suitable for making cutting boards, but not so much for casting work. The material may come with some minor scratches, but these can be buffed out easily with fine sanding paper. If the pieces are badly gouged or warped, however, request a replacement! Brushes: a set of small, soft-bristled brushes (example) will be useful for cleaning master patterns and applying mold releases and other treatments to molds. That's about it! For working with small quantities of resin and pouring it into complex multi-part molds, you may also find it useful to get a box of single-use, two-element 10 ml syringes with no rubber seals (e.g., from eNasco), and some blunt-tip dispensing needles. Mold release is a material that forms a protective barrier between the mold and the resin you will be pouring in, and makes it easier to demold final parts. The use of mold releases is optional when casting silicones in polyurethane patterns, or polyurethanes in silicone molds, because these materials don't adhere to each other in a particularly strong way - but still, a properly selected release agent makes demolding easier, and prolongs the life of any mold by reducing its exposure to reactive chemicals. On top of that, if you ever want to cast polyurethanes in polyurethane molds, or silicones in silicone molds, a robust adhesion barrier is simply a must. I have tried many different mold releases over the years, and my top pick is, unquestionably, Stoner A324; this spray-on agent beats most of the silicone, PTFE, or zinc stearate releases that I have tried before. They sell it for about $5 per can, and this should last you for about 1-3 months of hobby work. Stoner ships for free if you order a full box of 12 cans ($60). If you can't obtain this product in your market, silicone-based mold releases are your second best choice, although some varieties may gradually permeate and swell silicone molds. Releases based on mineral oils, PTFE, zinc stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, and so on, usually don't perform well in high-precision, vacuum-assisted casting work. The manufacturer of your silicone rubbers may be able to recommend some specific, locally available picks. That aside, you may want to also grab a wax-based mold release: they dry to form a hard, polishable, permanent layer that not only serves as a barrier, but should improve the surface aspect of polyurethane patterns. Low-viscosity brush-on formulations, such as Synlube 531, should work well; more viscous liquids, such as AdTech MR-1, may need to be diluted with naphtha when working with intricate shapes, but it's not a hard thing to do. Hardware store paste waxes that contain carnauba wax (link) work fine for simple shapes where dimensional accuracy is not critical, but high-gloss finish is desired - and if you dilute them to a water-like consistency, you can use them for complex models, too. In all cases, once the wax is dry, you can simply buff it with a soft cloth or a brush. Note: waxes should not be applied to silicone molds, because they will inevitably crack and peel off - and the solvents used are usually damaging to silicone rubbers, too. In general, with any new mold release, always test it by soaking a piece of silicone in it for about 5-10 minutes; any substantial or permanent change in dimensions would be a reason for concern. Mold releases aside, you may find it useful to get some of the following, largely optional chemicals: Basic solvents: it's good to have the following two options at hand: Acetone: when used sparingly, works as a great degreaser for plastics; if you don't make a habit of using it, you will not get robust bonds with cyanoacrylate or epoxy glues, especially on molded parts that may be still covered with release agents or so. It is also useful as a solvent for certain resin additives, and helps degas stubborn or high-viscosity resins (1-2 drops make a huge difference). It is advisable to get reagent-grade acetone from eBay (link); hardware-store variety is usually also OK, but may cause problems if it contains too much water. VM&P naphtha: useful for diluting mold releases and for cleaning up silicone spills. Ethyl acetate (an acetone-like solvent used in nail polish) works for the last two purposes, too - and may be a more environmentally friendly alternative. Siloxane surfactants (very optional): concentrated siloxane surfactants make it easier to use polyurethane resins as surface coatings; they do that improving wetting characteristics and eliminating pinhole defects. You will likely need them if you wish to use resins such as HP-21xx or IE-3075 as high-performance surface coats. Look for a product called Satur~8 on eBay; when added to resin at around 1.5%, it should make quite a difference. Silane couplers (ditto): these may come handy if you wish to add glass-based fillers to polyurethane resins, or improve bonding to glass surfaces. They modify the surface of these materials to make them form strong, covalent bonds with polyurethanes, epoxies, and similar plastics. The coupler is applied as a 2% solution in alcohol or acetone, and then left to dry in the presence of atmospheric moisture (water molecules are needed for the actual activation process to occur). The most common and useful compounds are called 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO) and (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTES). Concentrated variants can be ordered from Chemsavers.com (just drop them a mail), or get a smaller quantity from SPI Supplies (link for GLYMO, link for APTES). Diluted APTES is also available from crafts stores. Note that you don't always have to go through all this trouble; for example, milled glass fibers available from Fibreglast are already pre-treated in this manner, and there is no point in soaking them in a coupling agent again. On the other hand, Scotchlite glass microspheres come in a virgin state and will benefit from this step. Temperature-controlled ovens are not essential in casting work, but they let you perform several time-saving tasks: Drying molds, pigments, fillers, and other supplements if necessary. In most cases, this can be also accomplished with any cheap, $40 toaster oven. Accelerating the cure of resins when dimensional accuracy is not critical. This is sometimes preferred to chemical acceleration, because there is no need to purchase any reagents, and the behavior can be fine-tuned more easily. Thermal acceleration requires accurate temperature control between around 30-70° C, and will usually let you demold parts in under 1 hour. Post-curing finished parts, so that they achieve their ultimate properties sooner than normal (it may take up to a week at room temperature for all the reactions to cease). This requires accurate temperature control around 80-120° C. Low-cost toaster ovens are the obvious solution, but somewhat unfortunately, they have extremely poor temperature accuracy and stability, especially on the lower end of the scale. If you are an accomplished DIYer, you may be able to grab one and simply equip it with a more accurate, digital temperature control circuit. That said, if you are willing to part with a few hundred bucks and have some floor space, you can also try getting a real laboratory oven, such as this one ($400); hot air sterilizers and dryers may offer a smaller and slightly more affordable alternatives in some markets, too (example, around $300). If you don't have that much money, or simply don't have enough room, don't worry; you can do just fine without this piece of equipment, provided you are willing to wait a bit longer for your castings every now and then. There are some complex, multi-part molds where it may be hard to consistently avoid air entrapment, even with the aid of vacuum; on top of that, there are some resins that tend to be difficult to fully degas, or that will develop bubbles of carbon dioxide when not mixed perfectly well, or when exposed to residual humidity. That latter set of problems is particularly evident in mercury-free water clear poulyrethanes, such as the vanilla version of Innovative Polymers OC-5086. To improve your odds when dealing with such tricky cases, it helps to have a pressure pot; the idea is to increase ambient pressure surrounding the mold to about 3-4 bar, thus crushing and dissolving back any existing bubbles, and discouraging the formation of new ones. Sure, it's a brute-force solution - but can you argue with its results? Pressure casting equipment is more bulky, more expensive, and somewhat more dangerous than vacuum pumps (due to much higher pressure differentials) - and for most part, isn't necessary; get it only if you have plenty of room, and you are either forced to work with water clear resins that don't tolerate non-pressurized casting, or you are willing to spend at least $200 to improve your yields a tiny bit (say, from 85% to 97%). If you want to take this route, pressure pots start around $80 (link); nicer ones fetch as much as $300 (link). To operate it, you will also need a compressor - and these start from $100 from fairly noisy units from the hardware store, to $180 for relatively quiet-running ones; standard pressure hoses and fittings add another $20 or so. All right, all right - enough with all the theory and shopping tips. It's time to dig out that wax pattern that you have made before, and turn it into a finished work of art! This section is all-text, but if you need visual aids, this photolog is probably good to look at. Caution: similarly to many workshop and household chemicals, casting resins can be harmful if misused. In particular, they may react violently when mixed with incompatible substances; cause severe irritation or lasting damage if splashed into your eyes; and will emit dangerous vapors if overheated, burned, or intentionally aerosolized. Please refer to product safety datasheets (MSDSes), and to section 7 of this guide, for an overview of known risks, material handling recommendations, and disposal procedures. Do not proceed with any hands-on experiments until you have done so. Resin casting is fun, but you need to remember that once the components are mixed, the reaction will proceed no matter what; it's important to plan accordingly: read this section fully and memorize all the steps beforehand, and have all the necessary supplies and information within reach. First, you need to estimate the amount of resin you will need: for CNC-machined or 3D-printed shapes, simply ask your CAD application to calculate the volume of the master, and subtract this value from the volume of a dummy box of the same height, width, and depth. To have a comfortable margin, add about 15% to the result, or 10 ml, whichever is greater. Then, multiply that volume by the density of the resin (check the datasheet; it's usually between 1.1 and 1.4 g/cm³). The resulting figure is the weight of the material you need to prepare. With these calculations out of the way, prepare the following stuff: A roll of paper towels. Tear away about 5-10 pieces ahead of time, and place them within reach; this comes handy for wiping mixing tools, cleaning up minor spills, etc. An easily accessible trash bag for dirty towels and other things you want to get rid of in a hurry. Mixing container that fits within your degassing chamber, and holds at least 3 times the volume of resin you will be working with. A clean, flat, and clutter-free work surface, covered with aluminum foil or freezer paper. A kitchen timer, a stopwatch, or something else that would let you keep track of time. Although accidents are unlikely, you should still try to minimize potential damage: if there are any LCDs or other expensive gizmos in your workshop, consider moving them a bit farther away, or covering them with plastic sheeting. Don't wear your best clothes, and if you have a carpeted floor or expensive hardwood, cover the area that is most likely to suffer in case of a spill. When you are ready to go, place the mixing cup on a scale, then tare it. Agitate both components of the resin in their original containers, and then use a clean tongue depressor or a spoon to pour about 20 g of silicone into the mixing cup. Add a suitable amount of catalyst (the ratio is usually 10:1, but check the datasheet), start the timer, and begin mixing thoroughly for honest 3 minutes; be sure to repeatedly scrape the sides and the bottom to avoid leaving any unmixed resin in these spots. Next, place the cup under vacuum; the mix will initially rise as the bubbles expand, and then collapse back; you should keep it under vacuum for another 1-2 minutes past that point. If the resin gets dangerously close to overflowing during the initial rise, simply release the vacuum (i.e., yank out the hose), and try again; several cycles of that should do the trick - and next time, use a larger cup. The next step is to pour some of the resin into the mold created in chapter 3; use about half of the required volume or so. Place the mold on a strip of aluminum foil, and put that under vacuum; this will help the resin conform to even the most intricate shapes with no effort on your end. After about 2-3 minutes, you can slowly release the vacuum, pour the remaining amount of resin (use a bit more than necessary to get a convex surface at the top of the mold), and set the whole thing aside for several minutes to allow any bubbles to rise to the surface (or collapse back into the resin). If there are any stubborn bubbles on the surface at that point, you can apply a gentle burst of compressed air to get rid of them. Finally, cover the entire contraption with a flat, clean sheet of polypropylene; lay it down gradually, starting at one side, to avoid air entrapment. When done, weigh it down with something reasonably heavy - around 500 g should do - and brace the whole thing, so that the cover doesn't slide off. Be sure to check the timer at this point - has the entire process taken more than about 12-15 minutes? If yes, why? In any case, give it about 12 hours or so, until the resin remaining in the mixing cup is firm and tack-free. If you are impatient, placing the mold in a temperature-controlled oven at around 50° C will cut the curing time down to 1-2 hours or so - but don't go too high, given that this particular master is made out of wax. When the rubber is ready to demold, pull off the cover, and then use a dental hook or a similar tool to pry the rubber off near the corner of the mold. Remove it fully and inspect the result. if it looks flawless - as it should - you may want to briefly post-cure it at around 100° C for 30-60 minutes, and in the meantime, pat yourself on the back! Here are several questions that may be on your mind: What about the application of a mold release? Waxes already have a non-stick surface, so if you are following the instructions from chapter 3, you should be fine. When using prototyping boards or 3D-printed materials, you should apply a thin layer of mold release beforehand, and allow it to dry. Use a soft brush to spread the substance evenly, and don't overdo it: you want to wet the workpiece, but do not let the liquid pool in hard-to-reach spots. The resin didn't cure! What now? Ow, bummer. The most likely reason is insufficient mixing (especially if there are sticky patches or streaks in an otherwise well-cured material); bad mixing proportions; contact with incompatible materials (platinum-cure silicones are particularly sensitive to sulfur compounds); or low temperature (the resin will take forever to cure below 18° C or so). If you have ruled these causes out, feel free to drop me a mail, and we'll try to get to the bottom of it. What if I'm having trouble demolding? This takes some practice - try to find the right tools, and locate a spot where you can grab the rubber with a hook without causing any damage. For particularly challenging shapes, introducing pull tabs and draft angles in the mold, as discussed earlier, is the way to go. What if the mold is too big to put under vacuum? For simple shapes, you can just gently pour the degassed rubber in, starting at the lowest point of the mold. If there are any tight spots, it's useful to fill a syringe with a small amount of catalyzed resin, put a needle on, and use that to force the resin into these problem areas beforehand. When working with truly oversize pieces, you may find it useful to rely on a process called glove molding: brush on several thin layers of silicone onto the part, and then coat this flexible skin with a rigid, thixotropic polyurethane, epoxy, or polyester resin to create a backing shell. This is a great way to conserve silicone, although the mold takes more time and effort to prepare. (For optimal results, the silicone resin used for this purpose may need to be thickened to a non-flowable consistency with an additive such as Bluestar 22646 or with fumed silica. Fumed silica can be also used as a thickener for the rigid resin used as the outer coat.) Vacuum degassing only made the bubbles worse, what now?! The resin should rise and collapse pretty quickly; some bubbles will continue to appear, but they should collapse back shortly after the system is returned to room pressure. If that doesn't happen, check the ballast valve on your pump (it should be closed) and examine the entire setup for any leaks. Make sure that the pump is in good working order (many pumps require the right amount and type of mineral oil for lubrication). Verify that the pump is well-suited for the size of your vacuum chamber, too. If you're stumped, getting a cheap vacuum gauge from Amazon may help. How long will the mold last? Depends. When following the advice provided in this guide, around 50 pulls would be the norm. Lower-strength silicones, more aggressive resins (epoxies, polyesters, very fast or very slow polyurethanes), and complex geometries (deep molds with intricate detail) will lower the lifespan of silicone molds. Okay, okay - time for some polyurethane fun! Polyurethane casting is not dramatically different from working with silicones, but you have to be swift, and pay more attention to detail. Quite simply, with a resin such as IE-3075 or TP-4052, you will probably only have about 6 minutes to go through all the steps - so there is no time to look around for paper towels or a mixing stick. In general, before starting, you should go through all the preparation steps outlined in the previous section; and when done, you should also do the following: Make sure that the resin hasn't separated or crystallized. In almost all formulations, the isocyanate component should be clear, and both components should be completely homogenous. Agitate the containers if necessary; crystallization may require heating the containers slightly (usually not more than 40° C); always check with the manufacturer first, and exercise caution. Note: in filled systems, the filler settles out of the solution and hard-packs at the bottom of the container; this is particularly true for heavy fillers, such as glass. You need to use a small paint mixer attached to a power drill to properly homogenize the contents of larger containers; it's not a big deal, but watch out for spills. Manual mixing is viable only for small quantities, up to perhaps 250 ml or so. If you haven't done so already, get two smaller polypropylene bottles, and fill them up with a more manageable amount of isocyanate and polyol, so that you do not have to constantly agitate, open, and tip over gallon-size jugs. When done, blanket the original containers with "canned air" or nitrogen, and close then tightly. Be sure to label the new bottles clearly, too. Make sure that the mold and any hygroscopic fillers you want to add are perfectly dry - especially before first use, or after extended storage. Placing solid materials at 110-150° C for about 10-20 minutes, or applying vacuum for 5-10 minutes, is a good option if you want to play it very safe. Prepare a perfectly flat, spill-proof surface on which the silicone molds will be laid out while the resin cures. You can use a sheet of polypropylene, or a neat piece of aluminum foil with no creases. Whichever option you choose, applying some mold release to that surface is a good idea. Grab a small, flat sheet of polypropylene or HDPE to serve as a top cover for the mold. Mark one side with a permanent marker, apply a thin coat of mold release to the other, and place the sheet within reach. Apply a very light coat of mold release to the silicone mold, and spread it evenly with a brush. Repeat the process every 5-10 pulls, but don't overdo it; for casting polyurethanes in silicone molds, too little is better than too much. Allow the release to dry for 15 minutes or so. With all the preparations taken care of, you are ready to roll. Place the mixing cup on the scale, tare it, and pour the required amount of isocyanate; in our case, 10 g will do. Next, gently pour the appropriate amount of polyol (for IE-3075, this will be 8.9 g), start the timer, and begin mixing very thoroughly, frequently scraping the walls. Most polyurethane resins, IE-3075 included, require at least 90 seconds of mixing to progress from a dispersion to a proper solution when mixed in a small quantity - and if you stop sooner, the cured material may not cure properly. Do it right. When done, place the container under vacuum, and turn on the pump. The resin should take no more than about a minute to rise and collapse back; if it's taking much longer, your vacuum chamber may be too big, or the pump may be inadequate or malfunctioning (e.g., due to an open gas ballast valve, or due to contamination). If, on the other hand, everything went as expected - and the bubbles have collapsed in a timely manner - you should now pour some of the resin into the mold cavity (to fill it roughly halfway, taking care to cover any detail where air entrapment is likely), and place the mold under vacuum for another minute or so. Don't worry if it never stops bubbling at this stage; that's OK. After a brief round of degassing, release the vacuum gently, place the mold on a previously prepared flat surface, and add the remaining resin, until it overflows and forms a convex surface (this is important - otherwise, air entrapment is a lot harder to avoid). Grab the polypropylene cover and carefully lay it on top of the mold, using the technique outlined for silicones. You should brace the cover against something, so that it doesn't slide off, and weigh it down with around 200 g (larger molds can be clamped with several kg of force, but this particular one is relatively easy to squish). Well, that's it! Before you go, check the timer; if the process has taken more than six minutes, you should figure out how to improve it. In any case, leave the mold alone for at least 3 hours (or more, depending on the resin used), and when you come back, confirm that the material left over in the mixing cup is tack-free and hard as nails. Next, gently flex the polypropylene cover to detach it from the part, and extract your casting from the mold. Hopefully, the result is perfectly fine; that said, the likelihood of mishaps is higher for polyurethanes than it is for silicones - so if something isn't right, don't despair. Here's a quick summary of the most common issues I have seen: The resin is still sticky or gooey: assuming you waited long enough, the culprit may be low ambient temperature (try to stay close to 20-25° C), incorrect mixing proportions, or mixing the wrong components (the containers all look almost the same). A less likely cause may be the introduction of a problematic filler or dye, or the use of a resin that is incompatible with platinum cure silicones (this is rare; the datasheet should have said so). Treating the surface of the mold with a separately purchased polyurethane catalyst is a possible workaround for that last problem - see later on. The material turned into a foam: this may be caused by using a resin that crystallized during storage and hasn't been heated up to dissolve the crystals; by adding a filler or other additive that contained a significant amount of water; or by similar type of gross moisture contamination (wet hands, condensation, etc). In some formulations, failing to properly degas the catalyzed resin, mixing for way too short, or not allowing the mold release to dry properly before pour, may also cause a similar symptom. (If you suspect your vacuum setup, check out the tips in the previous section.) Top surface is soft and scratches easily: this is almost always due to insufficient mixing. Dispersed droplets of polyol have coalesced and, being lighter than the isocyanate component, floated up. More thorough mixing or higher ambient temperature will usually fix the issue. Premixing - as discussed later on - should also help. Discoloration or clusters of tiny bubbles running around edges or in other well-defined streaks: usually also a matter of insufficient mixing - see above. Several individual, round bubbles that floated to the top or are stuck in tight corners at the bottom of the mold: air entrapment during the casting process. If there are stubborn bubbles still present in the liquid as you are pouring it into the mold, and your vacuum system is in good working order otherwise - mix in 1-2 drops of acetone per 10 ml of resin before degassing, and see if that helps. Oh - when in-mold degassing is not possible due to the size of the part, applying the resin with a syringe or a brush may help with any tricky spots. Giant tear-shaped bubble near the top surface: air sucked into the mold due to applying too much force when placing the cover or insufficient clamping. It may also be that you haven't poured enough resin to begin with, or that the cover or your work surface is warped. Several oddball bubbles in thin sections, especially if suspended in the middle of the part: often caused by using a highly moisture-sensitive and slowly curing resin, such as OC-5086; the bubbles form as the resin is already partly-solid, contributing to their sometimes elongated or meandering shapes. If all other options fail, pre-heating the molds, adding some extra catalyst (see later), or using pressurized casting will help. If you are seeing any issues, it's important to narrow the problem down right away, while the number of variables is still fairly low. If you are out of ideas, don't hesitate to ping me at lcamtuf@coredump.cx; I may be able to help. A good place to discuss your experiences or showcase your work may be /r/resincasting, too! Anyway - if everything turned out to be just fine, you may want to briefly post-cure the part and any leftover material. Place it at around 100° C for one hour, and then play with it to get a sense of its physical properties: try drilling a hole in or scratching the surface of one of the leftover bits, and see how hard it is to break it. This section is just a quick a collection of random notes that should come handy in real-life projects, but that I wanted to keep out of your first casting job. Enjoy! Before we dive into various advanced topics, you should know that there are significant differences in the handling characteristics of various polyurethane resins, even if the advertised cure times and ultimate physical properties of the material are roughly the same. In particular, be aware of the following: The choice of catalysts will affect the resin's sensitivity to moisture, often dramatically so. Some resins with highly selective catalysts will cure pretty well in open air, and can be used as surface coats (e.g., HP-21xx); some have moderate sensitivity that can be greatly lowered using the premixing technique outlined later in this chapter (IE-3075, TP-4052); and others, such as OC-5086, really need to be modified with an aftermarket catalyst, or pressure-cast, to maintain sanity when making precision parts. The use of blocked or temperature-sensitive catalysts helps achieve long pot life followed by a snap cure when casting larger models; unfortunately, the same trick may prolong demold time when working with tiny parts that never reach the activation threshold. The exact composition of the system will greatly affect miscibility of the formulation at lower temperatures, before the reaction really kicks in. Some resins will require very little stirring when working with quantities around 10-20 ml, but a few may need as much as 5 minutes of work, unless you are willing to increase the temperature slightly (to ~30° C) or employ a similar trick. Depending on the composition, the resin may have a brittle stage, at which point it is very vulnerable to cracking even under minimal stress; in other systems, incomplete polymerization is simply marked by susceptibility to plastic deformation. Because of all these striking differences, don't take everything you see in this guide as universally applicable to every formulation on the market; and in the same vein, don't expect your own experiences with product A to be fully applicable to product B. If in doubt, request a sample of any new product you are considering, or simply ask. Let's start with something simple. Non-reactive (i.e., plasticizer-based) liquid dyes and coloring pastes can be mixed into the working amount of isocyanate, before adding any polyol; when taking this route, just try to stay under 2% by volume (around 8-10 drops per 10 ml); if you find yourself routinely having to add more, consider switching to dry pigments or a higher-yield dye or a reactive carrier - because past this point, solvents used in the dye will be affecting the properties of the part. Reactive coloring pastes designed specifically for polyurethanes use a polyol as a base; that's the case for pigments from Innovative Polymers. Their main benefit that they can be added at much higher levels without completely messing up the properties of your parts. In principle, you should subtract the weight of the added dye from the required weight of polyol - but in practice, this varies from one formulation to another. In a quick experiment with IE-3075, I found that using the nominal amount of polyol results in improved strength. Results in other resins may vary. When working with dry pigments, there is a bit more legwork involved. If you simply dump the pigment unceremoniously into the liquid, it will probably clump together - and stay that way. To avoid this, you need to place the desired amount of material in an empty mixing cup, tare it, and start adding isocyanate drop by drop, mixing constantly, until you end up with a homogenous, runny paste (siloxane surfactants can make the process easier, too). Once the paste looks good, you can gradually add the remaining isocyanate while constantly mixing - and you should be all set. Tip: if you have a high-yield, hard-to-disperse powdered pigment that you keep coming back to, it may make sense to make a custom coloring paste for future use. Simply disperse it thoroughly in an inert plasticizer (e.g., dipropylene glycol dibenzoate, discussed earlier; silicone oil works for platinum cure rubbers) or in a suitable polyol, and pour that into a dropper bottle. Of course, as noted earlier, you should ensure that the material is moisture-free; in tricky cases, premixing the resin or adding zeolite should help. Glass-based fillers, such as Scotchlite or milled fibers, may benefit from being pre-treated with a silane coupler, too. Premixing is one of the simplest and lesser known tricks that can help solve many of the problems that crop up in some polyurethane casting jobs. For example, it can dramatically reduce shrinkage without affecting cure time; lower the risk of cure inhibition; halve the time needed to fully mix the resin in small batches; and greatly reduce the sensitivity to moisture, to the point of making many systems suitable for surface coating applications. These benefits stem from the reduced reactivity and improved compatibility of a partly polymerized liquid. It's not a silver bullet, but for many formulations, it's pretty close to being one. The only price to pay for premixing is an increase in viscosity, which typically isn't a big deal if you have started with a low-viscosity system such as IE-3075; and the added expense of about 5 minutes of work and about one hour of waiting per every batch that you intend to cast. If you want to try it out, the recipe is very simple: measure the desired amount of isocyanate, add all the fillers and dyes you want to have, and then introduce between 10% and 20% of the necessary amount of polyol; this mix needs to be stirred thoroughly, degassed - and then stored in a covered cup, blanketed with an inert gas, for about 1-2 hours. At that point, the remaining polyol can be mixed in, and the resin can be cast. Keep in mind that premixed resins will have short shelf life: the viscosity will keep increasing, and in presence of a catalyst, the isocyanate will more aggressively react with ambient humidity and deteriorate. You should premix only the amount you intend to use right away. Oh - in case you are curious, this graph shows the impact of premixing on the exotherm for 10 g of IE-3075, and how it compares to the use of fillers. The measurements were taken using a thermocouple submerged in a small, insulated polypropylene cup, approx. 30 mm in diameter: Here's another tidbit you won't find in any other hobbyist reference on resin casting: it is possible, and in fact fairly easy, to chemically slow down many polyurethane systems to significantly reduce shrinkage; and to accelerate slow-curing ones to get your parts sooner or have fewer artifacts in thin sections of your molds. Why bother, you may ask? Well, it not only saves you money, compared to buying several resins for different applications - but perhaps more interestingly, it enables you to come up with custom-tailored cure profiles that are of no commercial interest to the manufacturer. In essence, there is a wide variety of catalysts used in castable polyurethane resins. Every catalyst behaves differently: some are highly active at room temperature, some kick in only later on, when the resin has warmed up due to exotherm. Some are better at driving the early stages of polymerization, but stop shortly thereafter; some have a sustained effect until the very end. Some are highly selective toward the desirable isocyanate-polyol reaction, and some don't mind catalyzing the isocyanate-water reaction - which leads to the formation of bubbles of CO2. Some are very stable, and some deteriorate when exposed to open air and other substances, which may cause inhibition or poor surface cure. But there is no single product that gives you the very best on all fronts. For this reason, manufacturers combine various catalysts to reach a compromise that makes sense for their intended customers - but these parameters aren't necessarily ideal for your needs. For example, OC-5086 is a resin designed for larger castings; when dealing with tiny parts, it will cure too slowly, and with far too much sensitivity to ambient moisture. Thankfully, you can fix this on your own. Ideally, if you wish to use OC-5086 or HP-21xx - or accelerate any other finicky resin - you should get bismuth neodecanoate from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Krackeler. The cost is around $35 for 250 g, and that amount will last you forever. The catalyst isn't dangerous, but both of these places have a blanket policy of shipping only to commercial addresses. If you can't have it shipped to work, ping the folks who run Chemsavers.com - they should be able to get it for you and ship it to your home for a very modest premium. Bismuth neodecanoate is a syrupy liquid which needs to be diluted with a plasticizer (e.g., DPGDB), a suitable polyol, acetone, or something else of that sort. Depending on the resins you are working with, you may have to experiment with dosage, but typically, levels between 50 and 500 ppm will be enough. For example, to "fix" OC-5086, you can prepare a 4% solution in plasticizer, and add it at about 1-2 drops per 10 ml of isocyanate as you are getting ready to mix it with a polyol. To speed up HP-21xx, you will need a solution closer to 50%, added in similar quantities. Now, if this particular bismuth compound is hard to find where you live, don't despair! A decent alternative is tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, also known as stannous octanoate. This substance is commonly sold as an accelerator for condensation-cure silicones; for example, a nearly pure form is available under brand names such as Smooth-On Accel-T, Quantum Silicones QSil STO, or Bluestar VICURE #2. Just be careful not to buy anything based on dibutyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin dineodecanoate, or a similar tin(IV) compound: they will work great, but also happen to be a lot more toxic. As with bismuth, the appropriate dosage varies depending on the resin; for OC-5086, a 4% solution, added at 1-2 drops per 10 ml of isocyanate, is a good starting point. Note that the compound is a bit more harmful than bismuth - handle it with care. Bismuth and tin aside, there are several other, more exotic options to choose from. They may offer very specific benefits, such as improved curing characteristics in particular systems, or no subsequent inhibition of platinum silicones (which are somewhat sensitive both to bismuth and tin). If you need additional guidance, click here to expand a section with some rough notes. Alternative catalysts: there is a large number of other catalysts used in polyurethane formulations. The list below includes some of the more common choices, along with an explanation why they aren't featured more prominently in this chapter: Other complexes of bismuth. According to scientific literature and tons of published patents, various other alcohol-soluble soaps of bismuth, including 2-ethylhexanoate and naphthenate, perform very well. Nevertheless, they are less common and tend to be more expensive. Complexes of zinc. Various zinc-containing compounds - including 2-ethylhexanoate, neodecanoate, and acetate - are commonly used as polyurethane catalysts. On the flip side, they are less potent than bismuth, tend to be less selective, and have a more non-linear temperature response - leading to higher exotherm in bulky castings and slower cure in thin sections. Triethylenediamine. A very potent catalyst, actually offering superior surface cure in products such as HP-21xx - so if you are doing a lot of work with amine-based formulations, go for it. On the flip side, it messes up resins such as OC-5086. Other non-metal catalysts. A fair number of other amines, imidazoles, and similar substances exhibit strong catalytic activity in polyurethanes, although most of them tend to favor the reaction with water over the reaction with polyols. There are several exceptions, but they tend to be difficult to find. Something like 1,2-dimethylimidazole or n-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole may work. Zirconium acetylacetonate. Reported as an excellent catalyst for some formulations, and a weak one for others. More exotic zirconium complexes are said to work more consistently, but are rare. Complexes of aluminum. Commonly reported as highly selective but low-potency catalysts. Aluminum acetylacetonate is commonly mentioned, but has fairly high acute toxicity. Safer compounds tend to have lower solubility or other drawbacks. Complexes of titanium. Sometimes cited as potent catalysts with unclear selectivity. I had a chance to test titanium isopropoxide once, with decidedly mixed results. As with zirconium, more exotic complexes may work better - not sure. Other metals. About half of all the metals in the periodic table shows some catalytic activity in polyurethanes; notable examples include iron, copper, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, vanadium, manganese - plus toxic elements such as mercury, lead, cobalt, and so on. In general, they tend to be less potent, less selective, or problematic for other reasons. There is also a long tail of other substances, including certain acids and bases, that show some catalytic activity - but usually need to be added in much higher quantities. Random rant: as noted above, most suppliers of lab chemicals are no longer willing to ship to residential addresses. Such restrictions make some sense for haz-mat materials - but the companies simply won't do any business with you, even if all you're trying to buy is salt or glucose. There are two reasons for this. First, there is a growing number of government agencies - ranging from DHS, to DEA, to CPSC (yes, that's right!) - that don't want people to make anything ranging from illicit drugs to bootleg fireworks. Companies that sell to individuals face a hodgepodge of regulations and vague reporting requirements, and risk police raids and other serious consequences if they mess up. Second, there are liability concerns: if a kid loses an eye and his parents sue - well, even if the manufacturer prevails in court, there are still legal expenses and bad PR to deal with. Because of this, it simply makes no sense for most of them to cater to the hobbyist market at all - shipping to a commercial address creates a pretense of due diligence, no matter how weak it may be. To keep chemistry alive as a hobby, I urge you to support the remaining few places that did not succumb to this trend; in particular, consider going with eBay sellers or friendly outlets such as Chemsavers even if you have an opportunity to order certain chemcials directly from the manufacturer for less. Just stay away from ScienceLab.com. In many types of polyurethane formulations, it is possible to slow down the reaction by converting the catalyst to a less ractive complex. In particular, systems that rely on amine catalysts (and do not contain reactive amines as crosslinkers or any other vital components of the formulation) can be slowed down with strong, non-oxidizing acids that react with the catalyst to form a largely inactive ammonium salt. In the same spirit, some of the less obnoxious thiols and certain other substances can chelate a variety of organometallic catalysts. In products such as IE-3075 or OC-5086, you can get good results with p-toluenesulfonic or methanesulfonic acid, both of which are available from Chemsavers for around $20. Methanesulfonic acid is slightly more convenient, because it is liquid at room temperature; but p-toluenesulfonic acid is pretty easy to directly dissolve in polyol. Levels around 0.1-0.5% by weight should have a very pronounced effect; just be careful not to go overboard: excess acid may react with isocyanates and mess things up. This graph shows the impact of p-toluenesulfonic acid on the curing exotherm of IE-3075, using the setup outlined earlier on: If PTSA or MSA are not easily available in your market, a much less potent but possibly still acceptable alternative is sulfamic acid, a common cleaning compound available on eBay and Amazon for just a couple of bucks. The main problem with this compound is its relatively poor solubility in polyols and in most organic solvents. A saturated solution in n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) may be your best bet; it will need to be added at a level closer to 1-2% by weight, which isn't exactly ideal. The solution is also not stable in the long haul, so prepare only as much as you intend to use in a couple of days. What else? If you really can't get any of the above, you can try tartaric acid. Along with several other weak, aliphatic hydroxy acids, this compound will inhibit the reaction to some extent, although it shows some interest in side ractions that may liberate bubbles of carbon dioxide or impart a yellowish hue to your parts. On the upside, it's a common food additive, available pretty much everywhere; and it can be easily dissolved in acetone. Note that PTSA, MSA, and sulfamic acid are all highly corrosive; use gloves and eye protection whenever working with concentrated solutions. Oh, one more thing: keep in mind that while adding catalysts to a resin is guaranteed to make a positive difference, adding a particular inhibitor is not. Of the fast-curing resins discussed in this guide, I never found a way to significantly slow down TP-405x, but almost everything else seems to be a fair game. Every now and then, you may be hoping to modify the properties of a resin in a way that goes beyond what's possible with non-reactive fillers, plasticizers, and so on. Other times, you may be interested in changing its cure speed in a situation where the methods outlined in the previous section are impractical or simply don't work. Well, the good news is that you can do quite a bit without resorting to making your own formulations from scratch. First of all, if you have two resins with comparably reactive isocyanates or polyols, and similar catalysts, you may be able to simply mix them together as-is. For example, let's say that you own HP-2150A and HP-2160D, and want to create a range of tough elastomers. The mix ratio is 100:43 for the first resin, 100:20 for the second one, and you want to blend them at a ratio of roughly 2:1 to get a rubber around 70 Shore A. In this case, suitable mixing amounts may be: HP-2150A isocyanate: 10 ml HP-2160D isocyanate: 5 ml HP-2150A polyol: 4.3 ml (10 ml * 43 / 100) HP-2160D polyol: 1 ml (5 ml * 20 / 100) Of course, if the systems are based on dissimilar chemistry, the resin may cure prematurely, not cure at all, or have disappointing mechanical properties. Even in this case, not all is lost: you may be able to get somewhere by starting with a single resin, and then partly or completely substituting one of its components with that belonging to another system. There are situations where it won't work, and situations where it will give you useful materials with faster or slower cure profiles, and mechanical properties somewhere between these of its constituents. The challenge with this second approach is figuring out the correct mixing ratio for isocyanate coming from product A, and polyol coming from product B; the manufacturer won't tell you how many reactive NCO and OH groups are there in each of the components, and without this information, you have to resort to trial and error. The correct ratio is usually between 100:30 and 80:100, and you can pinpoint it by doing several tests and selecting the range that resulted in the highest indentation hardness (Shore D durometer costs about $25-$50 on eBay); guessing the ratio within 5% should be fine in most uses. As noted earlier, polyurethanes and silicones begin polymerizing the moment you mix the components; by the time you reach the demold time, the reaction is mostly over - but some cross-linking may continue for many days or weeks at an exponentially decaying rate. As this process goes on, the properties of the part will keep approaching these advertised in the datasheet. If you are impatient and want to demold your castings sooner than normally possible, but don't want to sacrifice pot life or deal with chemical catalysts, placing the mold in a temperature-controlled oven will typically cut the time in half per every 10° C over ambient. Alas, the combination of significant thermal expansion of silicones (0.025%/°C), and the somewhat lower but still noticeable expansion of rigid polyurethanes (0.005%/°C), will probably affect dimensional accuracy of the part - so if you are aiming for snap fits, it makes sense to keep the mold at room temperature for as long as you can, and then bake it at no more than perhaps 40° C. For an already demolded part, post-curing is a valuable process that involves fewer trade-offs, and lets you reach the final properties of the material in hours, rather than weeks; since the resin is already largely polymerized, and is not confined in an expanding mold, its own thermal expansion is less likely to have lasting effects. It's important to ramp up the temperature gradually, though, so that the part doesn't get too soft. I suggest one hour at 40° C, followed by 30 minutes at 60° C and 80° C; the cycle can be wrapped up with 1-3 hours at 100-110° C. Note that many polyurethanes begin to deteriorate around 150° C, and that for transparent formulations and flexible rubbers, this limit may be even lower. All right, all right - enough with chemistry. But there's one more topic that may help you in casting work. Sooner or later, you will need to make parts with complex features on multiple sides. When replicating hand-made shapes, the process is usually very intuitive; for example, the geometry can be submerged in a blob of silicone that is carefully dissected with a scalpel or a box cutter, and put together later on. The process for designing accurately meshing multi-part molds in CAD software isn't much more complicated, but may take some effort to wrap your head around it. Let's say you want to make a part with a cross-section as shown on the left (and some additional features that prevent us from simply laying the shape on its side): The first step is to make a regular mold similar to what we would do for one-sided parts, but also add a small pedestal around the geometry - this will serve as a registration mark. The second mold is simply the same part and its pedestal, flipped around; this top mold will neatly slide into the bottom one. Voila! In more complex molds, the parting line may be located less conveniently, and may not allow all the air to escape on its own. In these cases, the mold will typically have a sprue through which the resin is poured in, and strategically placed vents to allow the air to escape from tight spots; a reservoir of resin on top of the spruce will offset for shrinkage in large parts, too. All in all, it's not hard, but when it comes to that, you will need to practice a bit. Righty-o. Now that we have the basics of machining, moldmaking, and resin casting covered to a good extent, it's useful to discuss more practical designs and part geometries of interest to robotics and other mechanical work. But before we dive into the inner workings of custom-designed gears and drivetrains, it's important to take a brief detour, and go over some of the prefabricated components that may come handy in your projects. Without a good source for tiny screws, springs, dowel pins, or cheap electronic sensors, you simply won't be able to get far. Rest assured, this chapter will merely scratch the surface of it all. If you are looking for inspiration, get "Machine Devices and Components Illustrated Sourcebook" by Parmley, or "Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook" by Sclater and Chironis; and if you need a primer on electronics, my concise guide to electronics for geeks may come handy, too. Machine screws, also known as bolts, are one of the most important items to put on your shopping list: if you want to create durable, serviceable designs that can't be approximated with indiscriminate use of glue, suitable fasteners are simply a must. In tough plastics such as polyurethanes, the use of screws is particularly easy: simply machine a slightly undersized hole and drive the fastener into it, impressing its own thread onto the part. Much of the time, you don't need a nut! If you want to shop for useful sizes and quantities of machine screws, skip your local hardware store. There are three particularly good online sources for miniature and subminiature fasteners in bulk: Micro Fasteners, Fast Metal Products, and Amazon Supply. Micro Fasteners is a good all-around source for low-cost screws in diameters over 1.5 mm or so; FMP offers decent pricing on fasteners smaller than that. Last but not least, Amazon Supply (formerly Small Parts) tends to be a tad more expensive - but Amazon Prime customers get free two-day shipping on every single nut and bolt, so especially for small orders, it's quite a good deal. The exact selection of fasteners depends on the projects you intend to pursue, but I recommend starting with a good assortment of 0.8 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2 mm screws (000-120, 0-80, and 2-56 designations in ANSI UTS, respectively), 100 pieces each. You should grab the cheapest variety of steel or brass screws, aiming for lengths around 4, 6, 8, and 15 mm; drive type doesn't matter a lot - could be slotted, Phillips, or hex. Expect to pay around $2-$5 per 100 pieces for common diameters, and closer to $10-$15 for sizes under 1 mm. Getting some nuts and washers, especially for 2 mm screws, is not a bad plan - but as noted, you won't be routinely needing them. You may also want to look into threaded rods, available from sources such as Amazon - the diameter around 2 mm probably being the most useful. Their more boring use is an extended-reach screw (with one nut at each end); a more interesting possibility is creating extremely compact and simple linear motion systems, like so: Another possible arrangement is using a motor to directly rotate the shaft. In both cases, the transmission enjoys a very high ratio, because every turn of the motor moves the nut by a distance equal to the pitch of the shaft - often in the vicinity of 0.5 mm or so. The downside is poor efficiency - likely under 20% - due to significant friction under load. Note: when it comes to online retailers, many hobbyists also love McMaster-Carr as a source for screws and other mechanical components. That said, they are almost always significantly more expensive than specialized distributors, and often more expensive than Amazon. They do have good deals on some otherwise hard-to-find stuff - say, miniature timing belts - but it's more of an exception than a rule. Traditional dowel pins are rather unassuming: they are just pieces of featureless, cylindrical steel, machined to tight tolerances. For their appearance, they find a truly surprising number of uses: as axles for spur gears and other rotating parts; as registration pins for molds and multi-part assemblies; as movement limiters and contact sensors; as serviceable torque couplers; and so on. You just need to have some - trust me on that. Non-tapered, solid metal dowel pins are available from many sources, including Small Parts / Amazon Supply, and cost very little - usually in the vicinity of $4 to $8 per 100 pieces. I suggest stocking up on 2 mm diameter pins in several lengths ranging from 4 to 20 mm. For high-precision work, 1 and 1.5 mm diameters may come handy, too. Dowel pins aside, it's also good to have some vanilla steel rods or tubes: they are very cheap (usually $1-$2 per meter), and can be cut to size with a hand saw to build anything from long-reaching axles (left) to fairly complex frames (right, also showing threaded rods used as linear motion systems): Metal bars with rectangular, hexagonal, or L-, I-, or T-shaped cross-sections are particularly useful for torque transfer, because you can simply slide components onto them, and there is no risk of slippage under radial load; perfectly round profiles may require the application of glue or the use of a lock screw. Similarly to dowel pins, springs have quite a few uses; many of them are obvious (wheel suspension and other pre-tensioned mechanisms, energy storage, etc), but some aren't. For example, springs are indispensable for transfering rotary motion at an angle - a process that otherwise requires complex bevel gears or universal joints. Perhaps the most common sort is a compression spring: it has generous spacing between its coils, and is meant to contract under load. You can find them inside many types of pens, spray bottles, and so on. The other popular type is an extension spring: it is tightly wound, and offers little or no compressive action - but stretches very well. It's difficult to recommend a particular selection of compression and extension springs up front, but it's definitely a good idea to have a robust variety always available in your workshop, simply to prototype stuff easily. Possibly the best and least expensive assortment I have seen so far is this set - 200 reasonably sized springs for less than $9; comparable kits are also available on Amazon. A great selection of individual springs with specific diameter, pitch, and length, can be also found on Amazon, usually in packs of 10. Traditional springs aside, you should also grab some spring wire (also known as music wire). It comes handy for making contact sensors (especially whiskers!), for creating simple tensioners, and for designing other devices where you want to use a straight piece of elastic material to deflect effortlessly, and then spring back to its original shape. There are many low-cost assortments you can find on the Internet - and as usual, Amazon isn't bad. There are many situations where it is desirable to constrain rotary movement to a particular axis of rotation, and support it so that the part doesn't wiggle back and forth, or snap under load. Sleeve bearings are the simplest solution: you can route the rotating part through a round, slightly oversized opening, and perhaps use a bit of grease to minimize friction. Alas, this approach has its limits: if the part is rotating very quickly, or if it's subject to significant radial forces, sleeve bearings will result in significant power losses or excessive wear. In particular, sleeve bearings for propellers and wheels may have a very limited lifespan. Because of this, you should get a decent assortment of ball bearings, and use them when appropriate. There are many sources of bearings on the Internet, but most of them tend to be pricey; VXB.com is a notable exception to this rule. They ship internationally and have an amazing selection of 10-, 20-, 30-, or even 100-packs at sensible prices - often hovering around $1 to $1.50 per piece. Some comparably good or even better deals can be found in the $0.99 discount bin or the 10-pack-section of Boca Bearings, too - although their "regular" prices are higher than VXB. Some of my favorite bearing sizes (ID x OD x H) are: 3x6x2 mm (link, $1 a piece, only for miniature projects); 6x10x3 mm (link, $1.50); 8x12x3.5 mm (link, $1.50); and 8x16x5 mm (link, $1). For larger projects, 8x22x7 mm bearings are a bargain, too - trading for about 50 cents a piece or less (link). If you don't have any specific designs in mind, but plan to work on small to medium-scale projects, grabbing a set of 6x10x3 mm or 8x12x3.5 mm bearings is not a waste of money. When building precision mechanical assemblies, it is usually much more convenient (and a lot cheaper) to make your own gears than to source them online. Part of the reason for this is that most of the time, you will want to use compound gears with very specific diameters, heights, tooth counts and ratios, axle bore sizes, and so on. Chances are, you won't be able to find just the right ready-made options online, at least not on the cheap. Timing belts are a different story, in part because they are tend to be simpler. Whether you need timing belts is a good question; they do offer an alternative form of gearing in applications where other solutions are inconvenient to use because of size constraints or the distances involved. For example, they may offer a space-saving way to couple a motor to a wheel without reducing ground clearance. Another popular use is in linear motion systems, where they can acutate any assembly clamped to the belt (and mounted on some sort of a rigid slide to keep it from flopping around). Historically, timing belts used to be fairly expensive and difficult to source in miniature sizes, but this has changed over the past few years. One of the best sources for small timing belts, many for around $1.50 a piece, is McMaster-Carr; check out the MXL series for some very good picks. Some of their smallest ones are just about 10 mm long and 3 mm wide. Timing belts run quiet and have very little backlash, but they are less durable and less rigid than plastic gears; they may be somewhat less efficient, too. The selection of motors at your disposal is definitely the single most important factor affecting the ability to bring your electromechanical designs to life. It's also something very easy to get wrong - or get right, but grossly overspend on. It is probably safe to assume that you are interested primarily in small, low-voltage DC motors; if so, the choice is roughly as follows: Vanilla brushed motors: the traditional variety, with rotating electromagnets and a mechanical commutator that powers them up in a particular sequence. The most important advantage of this class of motors is the broad availability of many different form factors, often at ridiculously low prices ($1-$2). That allows you to buy them by the dozen, and helps with rapid prototyping. Unfortunately, these motors operate efficiently only at very high RPM, and deliver fairly low torque, requiring the use of external gearboxes in almost every application; such gearboxes aren't difficult to make, but they add some complexity. The motors are also electrically noisy, and their lifespan is limited by the wear of commutator brushes - an issue in continuous-duty applications. Geared motors: these typically consist of a small brushed motor coupled to an integral gearbox that reduces output RPM, and brings the torque up to a more useful range. They usually operate with decent efficiency (85-95%) and offer transmission ratios of 20:1 to 400:1 or so. The main trade-off is that many of the lower-cost plastic gear transmissions are flimsy and rather unwieldy, so in many applications, it may be more desirable to create them yourself; higher quality alternatives, and planetary gearboxes in particular, often fetch as much as $20-$150. As a rule of thumb, it makes little or no sense to buy anything that looks like this; microminiature metal gears are a usually better investment, and if you look around, you may be able to find them under $8 a pop. R/C servos: affordable motors in this category usually consist of a geared motor coupled to a gearbox, a potentiometer attached to the output shaft, and a small integrated circuit that uses this feedback loop to maintain a position requested by the external microcontroller. The huge advantage of servos is the ease of use: they eliminate the need for additional sensors, H-bridge drivers, and other widgets normally involved in the control of a regular motor. Unfortunately, most of the low-cost servos are pretty bulky - a brick about 4-5 times the size of the actual motor within; most of them are also not capable of performing 360° turns, owing to the design of the internal potentiometer. On top of that, most of the plastic-geared servos are somewhat fragile - the sale of replacement gears is an industry of its own. Vanilla brushless: brushless motors deal away with mechanical commutation, and instead, have a rotor with permanent magnets, surrounded by stationary electromagnets that are switched electronically in a specific sequence. They are more durable than their brushed counterparts, and because of improved heat dissipation, occupy a smaller, more lightweight envelope. The key challenge with brushless motors is that they require precise external control to operate with good efficiency, often incorporating current sensors or Hall effect detectors; this adds cost and complexity. The other issue is that almost all the commonly available brushless motors are designed for high-current, high-performance applications, such as model aircraft - and with their extreme speeds and power demands, they are not particularly well-tailored for projects with more modest needs. Stepper motors: steppers are similar to brushless motors, but use a different rotor design with multiple densely packed poles; this makes the motor turn only by a small, precisely defined degree every time one of the coils is switched (7.5° or 15° is common in small motors; 1.8° in larger ones). There is no position sensing; their high-resistance coils are designed to let them hold a particular position without overheating, but limit their ability to operate at high speeds (their efficiency drops rapidly past perhaps 300 RPM or so). The primary advantage of stepper motors is their high precision, ease of operation, and competent performance at relatively low speeds, suitable for directly operating many types of mechanical assemblies. Their disadvantage is that they are essentially a constant-current device, sinking the same amount of power when freewheeling and under load. Exotic actuators: somewhat disappointingly, there aren't that many alternatives to plain old motors. Linear actuators are interesting, but typically prohibitively expensive ($100 and more). Solenoids, often used in door locks, are pretty cheap, but usually of limited utility. Lastly, "muscle wire", a material that contracts slightly (5% or so) when heated up by the flow of electric current, may sound cool - but because of the small displacement and fragility, it's more of a novelty than a practical tool. As you can see, there is no perfect solution. I personally prefer sticking to vanilla brushed motors and creating my own gearboxes, but if your patience can wear thin, servos or geared motors may be a better choice. For any of these motors, you should definitely look at the following characteristics when shopping around: Maximum rated voltage: every motor is designed for a particular maximum voltage, past which it may overheat or blow up in some other fashion. You can operate any motor at as little as 20% of its rated voltage - but in such a case, you will be hauling around a lot of dead weight in the form of windings, magnets, and so on, that are grossly oversized and serve no useful purpose. In general, motors rated for somewhere between 3 and 9V are probably of most use in small- to medium-size projects, owing to the availability of affordable batteries and power-switching transistors compatible with these voltages. Going beyond 12V can be expensive, and is best avoided unless you are building something big. No-load RPM and stall torque: these two parameters describe the behavior of the motor at two extremes: its speed when freewheeling with no load, and the turning force needed to effectively stop the motor in its tracks. In both of these cases, the motor is not doing any useful work, and its efficiency is zero. In between, the dependency between RPM and torque is roughly linear: with a load equal to 80% of the stall torque, the RPM will hover around 20%. This dependency may suggest that instead of using complex gears, it may be possible to simply operate the motor with a carefully tuned load of 95%, thus reducing its speed down to 5%. Unfortunately, this is usually a bad idea. In essence, every motor has a specific efficiency curve - and for low-power DC motors, it typically looks like this: the device is most efficient when the load is around 20%, and the performance drops off somewhat linearly past this point, eventually reaching 0% at stall. Therefore, in any application where power consumption and heat dissipation are of concern, it's good to operate the motor at somewhere between 5% and 50% of its maximum load most of the time; outside that range, you're just heating the air. To understand what you will be getting out of a specific motor, and to compare different products, it is often useful to compute their normalized torque: the torque they will be able to deliver when paired with a gearbox that brings their speed to a particular value (say, 100 RPM). Assuming that you are aiming for a load of 50%, and that the gearbox has an efficiency of 85%, the formula will be: normalized_torque = (stall_torque * 50%) * (idle_RPM * 50%) / 100 * 85% = stall_torque * idle_RPM / 470 Stall current: this parameter should help you size the power supply and all the associated driver circuits. When multiplied by the supply voltage and compared to normalized torque, it may be helpful for comparing the efficiency of various motors, too. Dimensions: all things being equal, the smaller the better - but form factors matter, too. Long but slim motors are preferable for wheeled robots, as they result in optimum ground clearance when placed inline with or near the axle; while pancake-shaped motors with a large diameter but short length are much better when you need to cram them inside an articulated joint in a legged robot without anything sticking out. Possibly the best source to find a great assortment of low-cost brushed motors (both vanilla and geared) is Kysan Electronics; they have a $100 minimum on all online orders, but seem to be willing to make exceptions if necessary. Good deals can be also sometimes found at various surplus outlets, including All Electronics, Electronic Goldmine, Surplus Shed, BG Micro, or HSC Supply - but their inventory can change rapidly, so your mileage may vary. Last but not least, for servos and brushless motors, Hobby King is hard to beat - they ship from Hong Kong, but do so promptly and cheaply; on orders under $200 or so, you are unlikely to run into import duties. Whatever you do, I'd recommend avoiding robotics-oriented sources such as Solarbotics, Robotics Connection, Pololu, Acroname, and many more. They are good people, but they usually sell exactly the same low-cost motors, and simply charge you more for the privilege of shopping with them. Case in point: this motor costs $23 when bought from Robot Marketplace, or $16 when you go to Solarbotics - but Kysan Electronics carries it for $8 a piece... or just $3 on orders over 1,000 (which is probably the price that the first two shops have paid). In any case, it makes sense to find 2-4 models that are best suited for your needs, and then buy 10-20 pieces of each; having a steady supply of well-performing motors beats having one or two of every mediocre product available on the market. My personal recommendations are: Vanilla brushed: Mabuchi FF-N20PN ("8117" or "8721") ($1.00): one of the tiniest motors I found that can still pack a punch (pager motors are smaller, but offer negligible torque). Diameter of 10 / 12 mm, length of 15 mm. When operated at 3V, it idles around 13,000 RPM, and delivers about 15 g*cm of stall torque - drawing 1.3A at that point. Great for miniature projects. (That motor seems to be hard to find these days; FF-N20PA-11155 motors available from Kysan are a close match, but cost a bit more - just under $2.) Mabuchi RF-356CA-10250 ($2.20): a reasonably powerful pancake-shaped motor for all-around use. Diameter of 24 mm, 8 mm long. About 11,000 RPM, 40 g*cm, 600 mA at stall when running at 6V. RF-300FA-12350 is a cheaper alternative, but it's 4 mm longer and has a lower speed. Mabuchi FF-130SH-14230-6V ($1.90): an elongated all-purpose motor that delivers 13,000 RPM when idling, and stalls around 115 g*cm, drawing 1.3A, when operated at 10V. Diameter of 15.5 / 20.5 mm, length of 25 mm. A comparable but slightly larger 12V alternative is Canon EN22. Spur geared motors: Sanyo 12GN-0348-NA3S and 12GN-0348-NA4S ($7.50): two cheap, robust, extremely small metal gear motors delivering about 2,200 g*cm (NA3S) and 3,500 g*cm (NA4S) of stall torque, and idling around 100 and 70 RPM, respectively. Both run at 6V. Their tiny dimensions make it worthwhile: they measure just 12 x 10 x 25 mm. Stepper motors: Symbol Technologies 21-02485 ($1.00): about 20 mm wide and 12 mm thick; a 5-wire hybrid that is best operated in bipolar mode (where the polarity of the windings needs to be reversed, necessitating the use of H-bridge drivers), and runs fine at 9V. 15° per step, 100 mA per coil, around 40 g*cm of torque. Unfortunately, appears to be out of stock right now. Epson STP35NI48SV50 ($3.00): a larger stepper motor, 35 mm wide and 12 mm thick. Unipolar operation (can be controlled with a couple of transistors), 7.5° per step, 12V, 250 mA per coil, around 220 g*cm of torque. Servos: Mini Man 4.3 ($3.50): a really cheap, miniature 6V servo of acceptable quality, delivering around 500 g*cm of stall torque. Its speed is about 10 RPM with no load. Hextronik HXT900 ($2.65): more powerful, slightly larger servo - 1,600 g*cm at stall, 40 RPM under no load, runs off of 6V. Very popular with hobbyists. Hextronik HXT5010 ($4.50): a larger, ball bearing servo capable of delivering about 6,500 g*cm at stall. It's slow - 8 RPM with no load at 6V. Reportedly can be modified to rotate 360°. If you need inspiration, here's a video of Mabuchi FF-N20PN powering a miniature planetary gearbox: Sensors are essential in almost any electromechanical design, helping interact with the outside world, and providing internal feedback about the state of mechanical assemblies. This section covers some of the most useful, low-cost choices to consider in your work: Tactile switches: simple, small, cheap, and very versatile. When placed behind an elastic bumper, they can work as a wall sensor for wheeled robots; in conjunction with rubberized foot or a floating axle, they can sense contact of the robot body with the ground; and when used as a movement limiter, they are useful for detecting the "home" position of many assemblies. A wide selection of microswitches in all shapes and sizes is available from Mouser and from other major electronics outlets. Pricing starts at $0.10 or so a piece when bought in reasonable quantities; be sure to look at dimensions, trigger force, and button travel. In most cases, it makes sense to stock up on the smallest, low-profile non-SMD switches you can find - for example, Mountain Switch 101-TS4311T1601-EV ($0.20). Larger ones - such as ALPS SKHCBFA010 ($0.30) - may be useful when a greater pressure-sensitive area is desired. Photointerruptors: extremely useful for non-contact position sensing when you don't want to obstruct the motion of a component. They work by shining an IR LED on the element, and then measuring the reflected or transmitted light with a phototransistor. My favorite is a tiny, wide-slot Toshiba TLP841 ($0.40); for reflective applications, Optek OPB609AX ($0.55) may come handy, too. Mechanical rotary encoders: these can be used to measure the angular position of an assembly. They use mechanical coupling, and therefore add some friction - but often offer a convenient alternative to optical sensing. Linear sensors, such as ALPS RDC803001A ($1.50), leverage a heavy-duty rotary potentiometer with several taps; pulsed devices, such as Mountain Switch 101-5433-EV ($0.55), simply alternate between closed and open circuit at predefined angles, commonly producing 12 or 24 pulses per turn. Only linear sensors will provide the absolute position, but they cost more, and require an A/D converter to interpret the data. Magnetic field sensors: solid-state Hall effect sensors such as Honeywell S41 ($0.50) can work very much like a photointerruptor, but will sense the position of a tiny permanent magnet embedded in the rotating element; their primary benefit is much lower power consumption, and the fact that they can "see" through opaque materials, enclosures, and so forth. Distance sensors: these can be positioned either in a fixed location on the robot body, or rotated to sweep the environment in a manner similar to a radar - creating a 2D image that is a lot more more useful than the data that can be acquired with a digital camera, especially if you don't have too much computing power to spare. The two most common rangefinding options are infrared and ultrasound. Infrared sensors are cheaper, but have a limited sensing range, and may be considerably less effective in very bright light (e.g., outdoors); Sharp GP2Y0A02YK is probably the most interesting option here, selling for under $15. For ultrasound, you must be prepared to pay a bit more; for example, MaxBotix LV MaxSonar EZ2 fetches around $25. Digital compasses: these may be useful in robots that need to maintain precise registration with the environment over extended periods of time. You can choose from specialized solid-state Hall effect sensor ICs, such as Honeywell HMC1051; and regular Hall effect sensors that monitor the position of a traditional compass needle (an example of that is Dinsmore 1490 or 1655). Expect to pay $10 to $40. Other fancy sensors: some designs - especially flying robots - may benefit from accelerometers, such as MMA8453QT ($1.40); flex sensors; heat sensors; inclinometers; tilt switches; microphones; digital cameras; or GPS units. That said, these are usually selected for a specific application, and there is no need to keep a continuous stock. If you have a favorite brand of microcontrollers, there is probably no need to revisit this topic; but if you are looking for advice, it's pretty hard to go wrong with AVR chips such as ATmega1284P ($8). This particular 8-bit MCU, for example, operates at speeds up to 20 MHz (internal oscillator is provided), has 128 kB of Flash memory for program storage, 16 kB of data memory (SRAM), and 4 kB of non-volatile EEPROM. It's essentially a complete computer-on-chip, complete with 32 bidirectional I/O lines, 8-channel 10-bit ADC, hardware PWM channels - all that supporting a wide range of supply voltages, from 1.8 to 5.5 V; there are precious few external components required to operate it in most real-world applications. ATmega chips have a mature GCC-based toolchain with tons of useful libraries, a nice emulator, and a pretty good IDE - and unless you are doing complex image processing or working on something else data-intensive, they will serve you well. (In more demanding tasks, you may need to spend quite a bit more on 32-bit ARM or AT32 chips; I also like Intel Edison.) For ATmega, the only other gadget you need is a simple USB ISP dongle (e.g., AVRISP mkII), costing somewhere between $15 and $30 - and even that can be avoided if you opt for a chip with a built-in USB controller. Note: some people love AVR-based development platforms such as Arduino or Teensy. I am personally wary of these boards, because I find them to offer very few real benefits over the AVR chip itself; you are essentially charged a 1000% markup in exchange for someone soldering the chip to a PCB, and then adding several components that are completely unnecessary in many uses, but make it look sophisticated (e.g., voltage regulators, external crystals). Especially when developing more complex software, you may find it useful to add a way for the MCU to communicate essential information in an easily readable way. Tethering it to a computer is one option, but you may also consider getting an LCD module based on a well-known HD44780 chip; for example, NHD-0216K1Z-NSB-FBW-L ($11) is a very user-friendly device with ample display space. It can be controlled with as few as 6 data lines, and is pretty trivial to interface with - its dedicated controller maintains its own display memory, and even stores editable font data and track of the cursor for you, so you just have to send ASCII data to the appropriate port. In addition to the MCU itself, you should also have a good assortment of standard "glue" chips that are useful for example in multiplexing and demultiplexing applications, and will allow you to extend the I/O capabilities of your chip almost arbitrarily. Probably the best IC family to stick to is 74HC - they are widely available and fairly cheap ($0.10 - $0.35 per chip), and offer respectable speeds and good load driving capabilities. You may want to grab basic logic gates (74HC00, 02, 04, 08, 32, 86 - NAND, NOR, NOT, AND, OR, and XOR respectively); line drivers (74HC240, 241, or 244); multiplexers, demultiplexers (74HC164, 165); line selectors (74HC137, 42, 151); and flip-flops / latches (74HC175, 75, 259). Some projects may also have uses for counters, timers (e.g., 7555), external oscillators, assorted op-amps, etc. About the only thing you can't do with all these parts is driving any power-hungry loads, such as motors: the tiny transistors inside most MCUs and 7400 series chips can output at best around 20-40 mA per line - enough for a LED or two, but not much more. It is possible to use discrete power MOSFETs (e.g., BUK7510) to control high-current devices, but doing so is not always space- and cost-efficient - so you may want to look into IC-based motor drivers. FAN8082 is probably the cheapest ($0.40) full H bridge (i.e., bidirectional) driver capable of delivering up to 1.5A at 18V to brushed motors and bipolar steppers; it even comes with rudimentary speed control. The disadvantages of this chip are its reltively high voltage drop (almost 2V), and the fact that it doesn't support "freewheeling" (high impedance) mode. Somewhat more expensive TA7291P ($0.90, 2A peak at 20V) supports all four output states: forward, reverse, brake, and freewheel; TLE52052 chip ($3.50, 6A peak at 40V) can drive even larger motors with ease. Several dozen similar products exist - shop around, and grab at least around 10 pieces or so. For driving unipolar steppers, solenoids, and other power equipment where you don't need to change polarity, you can also save some money by going with simpler devices: ULN2003 ($0.30) can drive up to 6 devices at 500 mA and 50V (or one device at 3A); while ULN2065 ($2) has four outputs capable of delivering 1.5A at 35V, adding up to 6A total. About the last major set of electronic components that you need to think about are the power sources you will be using in your work. To make the right call, you need to consider several factors: Nominal voltage: in most cases, you should use a power source that provides perhaps 10-15% more than the voltage required by the most power-hungry components of your design - and that's usually the motors. In general, somewhere between 3.5 and 11 V is ideal. Capacity: try to estimate the power needs of your circuit, and aim for something that would give you a sensible run time on a single charge. For example, if you are expecting to sink 100 mA on average, you will get up to 8 hours out of any 800 mAh cell. Peak current / ESR: make sure that the cell can accommodate the expected peak current draw of your device, with a generous safety margin. This matters: for example, a typical 9V battery will typically source no more than 1A - and once you exceed that, the voltage will drop dramatically. Weight and dimensions: there are substantial differences in power density between various cell types, so pay close attention to these characteristics, especially if you are trying to build something lightweight. Today, the best all-around option for robotics are rechargeable lithium-polymer cells, simply because of an excellent balance between capacity, weight, and cost. My favorite source is Hobby King. They have good products, and although they are in Hong Kong, they ship cheaply, quickly, and with no hassle whatsoever. If you browse their site, you can find a 7.4V 5 Ah cell, weighing around 300 g, for about $25; a smaller 1.6 Ah cell fetches $10 and tips the scales at 90 gram; while a tiny 800 mAh one weighs barely 50 g and costs $5. Of course, nothing comes free: lithium batteries have two drawbacks that you should know about. First of all, if they are charged improperly or badly damaged, they can overheat and catch fire - so you need to store and handle them with some care. The other issue is that they shouldn't be discharged past a certain minimum voltage to avoid altering their chemistry; using a voltage cut-off IC, such as MAX8211 or MAX8212, is a very good idea. Of course, there are many alternatives to Li-poly; a typical AA battery is nothing to sneeze at, and delivers up to 3 Ah, with peak current as high as 10A; your usual 9V battery is closer to 500 mAh and can't source more than 1A. If weight is not an issue, you can also go with lead-acid batteries, of course: they are cheap, but weight a ton ($20 will get you 15 Ah at 6V, but be prepared to haul around 2 kg). Ultracapacitors are also of some interest in recent years - but right now, they tend to be fairly expensive, especially if you are interested in supply voltages over 2.5V or so. Last but not least, solar cells deserve a honorable mention - although similarly to ultracapacitors, they are not that practical in everyday uses. Because of their lamentable power capabilities in function of their size, they are useful mostly as a way to conveniently recharge a chemical battery or a capacitor, and not as a continuous primary supply. Oh, one more thing: for prototyping, I recommend grabbing an adjustable benchtop power supply, such as Mastech GPS-3030D ($90); convenience of being able to quickly adjust voltage aside, their huge benefit is that you can limit the current to a safe value, so that an accidental short-circuit will not destroy everything in its path. The same can't be said about most batteries. Tip: the reason why you should match the supply voltage with the most power-hungry components in your circuit is that high-current DC voltage adjustments can be pretty tricky. It's easy to lower the voltage supplied to a low-current device, such as a microcontroller or a couple of LEDs: just grab a linear regulator such as LM317T ($0.25) or L7805 ($0.50) and be done with it. For efficient regulation of higher currents, or for stepping the voltage up, you generally need switched regulators, however. Such regulators are fairly complicated to build on your own, and get expensive if you want a plug-and-play solution. For example, ICL7660 - a chip that can handle up to 20 mA - goes for $2; Murata OKR-T3-W12-C - a hybrid device that can deliver up to 3A - retails for $7; and a 6A variant of the same Murata product will fetch $14. Well, it goes without saying that you will also need an assortment of generic electronic components to get anywhere: make sure that you have a bunch of resistors and capacitors, a handful of PCB mount potentiometers, some medium-power MOSFET transistors (n- and p-channel), a good selection of terminal blocks and ribbon connectors, a solderless breadboard or two for prototyping, perforated boards in various sizes, and so on. In fact, if you need any help with selecting the right components and using them in a circuit, check out my short primer on electronics in your spare time. What else? If you want to make your own PCBs for finished projects, you can of course print and etch them - although keep in mind that it's also quick and easy - and often more precise - to machine them on your CNC mill: you can simply selectively remove copper plating from a blank board with a cutter - and drill mounting holes at the same time. And of course, don't forget about installing a conveniently located and obvious self-destruct switch! To wrap up the discussion of technical topics, let's go over a collection of practical approaches that should help you create useful and reliable mechanical designs for small- to medium-sized projects - no matter if you are using CNC machining, 3D printing, or still carving stuff in stone. The failure to get even the most rudimentary understanding of these topics is one of the cardinal sins of hobbyist makers - so don't let this happen to you. The mathematics of material engineering are fairly obtuse, and the finite element modeling software that can be used to model the dynamic behavior of real-world part geometries is prohibitively expensive. Nevertheless, if you are designing small- to medium-scale components and can afford to learn from mistakes every now and then, there is a couple of simple rules of thumb you can follow to get great results without resorting to any of that. (You can also find quite a few good engineering tips on this page.) Perhaps the most profound cognitive dissonance you can experience during your first adventures in DIY manufacturing is making the first part that happens to be long, thin, and flat. Let's say you grabbed IE-3075 and cast a piece that is 2 mm thick, 1 cm wide, and 15 cm long; you will be probably impressed by how difficult it is to break this sample - but also shocked by how easily it deflects. It just doesn't seem to make any sense: the datasheet says that the material is ought to be 50% more rigid than the plastic used to make Lego bricks, and several times less flexible than the commodity plastics used in everything from toaster ovens to computer cases. But your toaster doesn't flex nearly as much, right? To understand what's going on, consider what would happen if you applied the same bending force to the side of the part, rather than the top: If you do that, you won't be able to flex the part even the slightest bit. The cross-section of the material is still the same - 2 x 10 mm - but all of sudden, it is a lot more willing to resist your efforts. That's because flexing the material amounts to stretching the polymer chains farther apart on one side of the part, and squeezing them close together on the other end. If the material is thin, the effect is relatively modest, and you don't need to invest a lot of energy to make it happen. For thicker segments, the displacement is a lot more dramatic, however: The effect is pretty significant. Simplifying slightly, the rigidity of the part is proportional to the width of the sample - but to the cube of its thickness. This behavior brings us to the manufacturing trick that is being used in almost every item made out of plastic or sheet metal - including toasters and Lego bricks. In essence, you can greatly improve rigidity by increasing the maximum span of the part in the direction subjected to bending loads - without adding any significant bulk. The most common approach is the addition of a couple properly oriented ribs: The average thickness of the part - and thus its weight or the amount of plastic used - hasn't changed significantly. But because each of these ribs contributes to rigidity in proportion to the cube of their height, their impact is more significant than it may seem. The following picture is a good example of the use of ribs to control the rigidity of a thin-walled chassis of a medium-size robot. Note how the ribs are routed around any locations where additional clearance is required, and not interfere with the mechanical design. In fact, they probably improve the overall aesthetics: It is also possible to achieve the same effect without having to introduce any "standalone" ribs; for example, if the part uses curved surfaces or happens to have outer walls, this can provide a comparable degree of reinforcement: Properly reinforced thin-walled parts weigh less, cost less, provide more clearance for other components, exhibit much less shrinkage - and often simply look better. Because of this, try to learn and use these approaches as often as possible. Stick to 1 to 1.5 mm as a baseline wall thickness for all the larger parts - especially for chassis components, covers, etc - and just sprinkle them liberally with ribs, gussets, and other features of this sort. A handful of ribs extending 2-4 mm from the surface of the part is usually all you need to make it work. So far, we've talked about the need to reinforce thin, long, planar surfaces; but there is one more situation where a small amount of extra plastic routinely saves the day. From the discussion of casting resins earlier in this guide, you may recall that the resistance of these materials to non-uniform loads (e.g., tearing) is dramatically lower than the ability to withstand uniformly distributed stress. For this reason, you should pay close attention to sharp corners, jagged edges, holes, and similar features in locations subjected to significant loads - and incorporate simple reinforcements to ensure that the stress isn't concentrated in any single spot. For example, when designing a coupling for an axle that may be subject to strong radial forces and shock, adding a fillet or a couple of load-bearing gussets can save the day; all other things being equal, the "vanilla" approach shown on the left is much more likely to fail: Given the negligible cost of these features, it typically makes no sense to spend too much time trying to figure out in which exact spots they happen to be absolutely necessary. Whenever it is clear that a localized stress may occur, throwing in a rib, a gusset, or a fillet is simply a good plan. Another problem that a novice designed may bump into is the question of fitting tolerances: when one part needs to mate with another, what should their respective dimensions be to form the desired type of fit? The correct answer depends on a number of factors, including the accuracy of your CNC mill, or the operating conditions of the assembly (temperature, risk of contamination, running speed). Nevertheless, when working with a reasonably accurate milling machine and dealing with normal circumstances, the following rules of thumb tend to work pretty well for rigid plastics: Snug fit: if you want the parts to mesh tightly - for example, to be glued or fastened together - make the opening exactly the same size as the mating part. Interference fit: if you want the parts to hold together without any additional fastening, you can undersize the opening by about 0.01 to 0.02 mm (i.e., offset the profile curve by 0.005 to 0.01 mm). Note that you will need to use force to make them fit, so this may be not an option for fragile parts or unusually brittle resins. Low-friction meshing: to allow a round element to rotate with minimal friction, it's usually sufficient to leave a clearance of around 0.02 mm (offset of 0.01 mm). Note that for high radial loads, ball bearings may be preferable to sleeve couplings. Self-tapping holes for machine screws: measure, look up, or calculate the minor diameter of the screw (the outer diameter minus the depth of the thread). Use this as a diameter for the hole. A drop of WD-40 will help drive the screw in for the first time. When in doubt, be quick to experiment: it takes just a couple minutes to machine a rectangular or cylindrical test piece and play with it. Save yourself the time and frustration of having to debug issues in more complex parts. Gears are an extremely versatile tool that will come handy in all sorts of mechanical assemblies. Depending on your needs, they can reduce or increase the speed of movement, adjust torque, or change the direction, axis, and type of motion - all that with high precision, excellent efficiency (95%+), and great load-bearing capabilities. Alas, unfortunately for hobbyists, much of the freely available information about the geometry of common types of gears is misleading or incomplete - and even the articles posted on Wikipedia are littered with inaccurate images or animations such as this. The key property of a well-designed set of gears is that they transfer motion almost exclusively through a rolling action, with very little sliding (and thus friction) involved; and that they maintain constant velocity and a constant angle of contact through the process. If you violate these principles, your gears will become inefficient, noisy, and prone to vibration. The optimal design is exemplified by the ubiquituos involute spur gear: The blue lines shown on this picture are the theoretical pitch circles of the gears; if you replaced the gears with idealized rubber rollers of these diameters, the behavior of the transmission would not change. The linear speed of any mating gears is the same when measured along the pitch circle, and the ratio of angular speeds depends on the ratio of their pitch diameters. For example, if one of the gears has a pitch circle with a diameter of 10 cm, and it's turning another gear with a pitch diameter of 4 cm, one turn of the former will rotate the latter by 10 / 4 = 2.5 turns. Before getting any real work done, you need to make up your mind about several key parameters that will define the gears used in a particular project; except for tooth count, these values should be the same for any two gears that are supposed to mesh with each other. This parameter depends chiefly on the transmission ratios you are hoping to achieve. The only constrain here is that with very low tooth counts, you will see a behavior known as undercutting: the two meshing gears will collide, necessitating the introduction of some additional clearance - and thus weakening the part: This is not a big deal if the undercut is small; but when it begins to extend significantly into the area where power transfer takes place - that is, the region above the so-called base line, the gray circle shown in the earlier animation - the performance of the gear may be compromised. To avoid having to heavily compensate for this issue, unless exceptional circumstances apply, try to keep tooth counts over 8-9 or so. Note: most of the gear generators you can find online can't deal with undercuts at all: quite simply, if you try to specify fewer than a certain number of teeth, they will reject your input or generate an incorrect result. Avoid these like a plague - and scroll down for better alternatives. As for the maximum number of teeth - there is no real limit to how far you can go, but to keep your models simple and the cutting process rapid, it's preferable to keep the count under 100 or so. This parameter is measured at the pitch circle. The tooth must be wide enough to allow the mating region to be machined with the tools you happen to have at your disposal; in fact, it's advisable to use tooth width at least 30% greater than the diameter of the smallest end mill in your collection. In precision applications that do not involve extreme torques, the value will typically range from 0.3 to 1 mm - and 0.6 mm is a good starting point. You may want to increase the width when working with larger models, to keep the number of teeth sane. When you look back at the animation shown earlier in this section, you will notice a slanted line that goes through the center. This is the path along which the gears come into contact, and the actual torque transfer takes place. The slant of this slope can be selected to suit your needs, but it needs to be reflected in the geometry of the resulting teeth: In general, low pressure angles result in quiet-running, precise gears that are easy to machine due to generous clearances - but will be weaker, and have more pronounced undercuts. High pressure angles result in thicker tooth profiles which need to be machined with smaller tools, and can be more noisy and prone to backlash and slippage - but also survive a lot more abuse. Sensible values for this parameter range from 12° to 25° or so - and my personal favorite for miniature assemblies is 17.5°. The addendum is the distance by which every tooth sticks out above the pitch (contact) circle. The recommended value that ensures continuous and smooth torque transfer is tooth_width * 2 / π, with some wiggle room if you are pressed for space or are running into other constraints. Going below 70% of the recommended distance should be done at your own risk. To minimize undercuts when dealing with low pressure angles and low tooth counts, you can use a larger addendum on the smaller of the two meshing gears, and a smaller addendum on the other one. This technique, known as profile shift, is particularly useful for gears with fewer than 12 teeth, where it can significantly reduce undercuts without compromising machinability (right): Of course, profile-shifted gears will not mesh correctly with regular ones - the mating gear always needs to have exactly the opposite shift. This is seldom a problem, but you need to keep this constraint in mind. All right! Equipped with all this knowledge, you can compute the profile for your first set of involute gears. There are many different approaches to this task, but my favorite method is unique in that it comes without the limitations that plague simpler techniques - and if you are so inclined, it can be easily generalized to deal with a variety of unusual gear shapes and tooth profiles later on. The process begins with calculating the circumference of the pitch circle for your gear: cpitch = tooth_width * 2 * tooth_count. From this, you can trivially calculate its diameter of the circle you need to draw (c / π). Once you have it on your screen, you need to add a straight line tangent to the pitch circle; this will be used to build a hypothetical mating gear with an infinite diameter. If we can mesh with this, we will be also able to mesh with any smaller gears encountered in real life. On this "pitch line" of our infinite gear, we can draw two lines perpendicular to it, precisely tooth_width apart - and rotate them around the point where they intersect the infinite gear by an amount corresponding to the pressure angle we want to maintain (18° in this example). To turn this into a proper tooth, we need to add a horizontal line that is normally placed addendum = tooth_width * 2 / π below; in fact, draw the line about 5% farther down to create some clearance for any dirt or grease caught in between gears. When done, trim off the excess - and voila: The next step is to simply perform a simulation of how this tooth would engage and then disengage with the actual gear we are trying to create. Recall the mention of rubber rollers: for any two meshing gears, the linear velocity at the pitch circle should be the same - so if the infinite gear (aka rack) moves by n millimeters, the other gear will rotate by 360° / cpitch * n. The rest should be fairly obvious; this is the pattern you will see if you keep creating copies of the tooth at successive offsets along the rack, and then rotating them back by a matching angle around the center of the pitch circle of our gear: The process can be automated easily in almost every CAD tool, although for the initial try, it makes sense to do it by hand; in any case, once you have this pattern generated, you simply need to trace a curve around it, replicate this curve using the polar array tool to create the preselected number of teeth, and offset the pitch circle by the addendum distance to trim off the unnecessary bits: Try to do this exercise on your own. With rare exceptions where backlash is completely unacceptable, you should draw the outline about 0.05 mm apart from the trace left behind by the simulation; without this small amount of play, the teeth will engage on both sides simultaneously, producing unnecessary friction. The beauty of the simulation-based method of constructing gears is that it's WYSIWYG, and that it takes most of the usual constraints out of the equation: for example, you can produce gears with any number of teeth, because the possibilty of undercuts is automatically accounted for. On top of that, it can be modified in several fairly intuitive ways. You can: Use custom tooth profiles: instead of the trapezoidal tooth profile we created in our example, you can as well draw a puppy, and still get a pair of working, matching gears. It won't be particularly efficient, but it will work. I'm not good with puppies, but here's an example of a less cute freeform tooth and its generated counterpart: More practically, you can also design gears that have an involute profile, but mesh only with a particular matching gear, by using that gear's tooth profile and its pitch circle, as opposed to a rack. This will help you reduce undercuts when other methods fail. Create custom gear shapes: there is nothing that forces you to perform the simulation against a pitch circle - the algorithm can be easily extended to use an arbitrary "pitch curve" to generate oddball gears that produce variable transmission ratios and do other funny things. Draw internal gears: "inverted" gears - essentially a ring with teeth pointing to the inside - are indispensable in certain types of mechanisms, including high-performance transmissions covered in section 6.4. These need to be generated to mesh with a specific gear running on the inside, using its tooth profile, and are tough to get right by other means. Sounds more fun than it should be? You bet it does! Tip: of course, there is no need to repeat all these steps by hand. The most flexible option is this web-based generator developed by Rainer Hessmer. The tool is very user-friendly: simply enter several parameters and get a DXF file in return. The tool properly handles undercuts, internal gears, profile shifts, and so on - so take it for a spin! If you're using Rhino, you may also enjoy my experimental Grasshopper module, which provides a comparable degree of flexibility, but is much faster, with instant feedback right within the CAD environment. It comes with fairly detailed instructions and features important for machineability, too. To run the add-on, you will need to install the Grasshopper plugin itself, open the plugin with the namesake command, and then load the gear_calc.gh file into the app. Note that the internal gear functionality is not fully operational yet: undercuts are not properly compensated for if the diameter of the meshing gear is close to that of the internal one. Last but not least, some Rhino users may want to grab a copy of my earlier semi-automatic script. Its main advantage is that it can handle arbitrary tooth profiles and very accurately handle internal gears. It is activated by entering Hob4 in the command prompt and answering some simple questions about the gear you want to generate. It will then draw the appropriate circles and - if instructed to do - a standard trapezoidal tooth profile. You can modify the profile or simply select the one produced by the script, and run Hob4 again to finish the job. As noted, the script also allows you to generate internal gears; to do that, you must provide a mating pitch circle and tooth profile extracted from a previously generated external gear. This circle needs to inside, and must be touching the top of the pitch circle for the internal gear. Involute spur gears are remarkably versatile, easy to model, and easy to manufacture - but they are certainly not the only type of a gear you can use. Let's go over some of the more exotic but still useful options that may come handy in your work. In comparison to planar spur gears, bevel gears have a very important property: they mesh at an angle, and therefore, can be used to change the axis of rotation. Although this goal can be achieved by other means - for example, with simplified crown gears or with worm drive, bevel gears do so with remarkable precision and efficiency. The process of constructing a set of meshing bevel gears is considerably more complicated than what we discussed before, and involves a brush with non-Euclidean spaces; nevertheless, if you follow these instructions closely, you should be able to pull it off. As with spur gears, the first step is to choose tooth counts, width, height, and pressure angles; you should also think about the exact gear ratio you want to achieve, as one pair of gears will be not interoperable with any other differently configured set. Next, draw the appropriate pitch circles for both of the gears you want to create, placing them on the X-Y plane; when done, add two lines perpendicular to this plane and going through the center of each circle. Finally, rotate one of the circles (and the associated perpendicular line) in the Y-Z plane, pivoting the operation around the point where touches the other one. In our example, we will use 90° between the mating gears, but any other angle is a possibility: With this out of the way, draw a line that starts where the two perpendicular lines meet each other, and ends where the two circles touch each other (Q). Next, using the Y-Z drawing plane, add a line perpendicular to this newly created one. This final line is denoted as l: To minimize clutter, we'll focus on constructing the gear profile for circle a, and hide the other circle for time being; the steps needed to construct a suitable gear profile for the second gear will be analogous to what we are doing past this point, so you should have no difficulty figuring it out. The next task is to mark two locations on the line l that are in equal distance from point Q; these newly created locations are denoted as C and D. The distance must be a bit greater than the addendum for your gears, but beyond that, the exact value doesn't matter. With these two points in place, draw a circle in the X-Y plane that has the same center as circle a, and passes through point C; a similar circle should be drawn for D. Lastly, use the loft operator after selecting the newly created circles c and d to build a conical surface: The next challenge is to check the manual for your CAD application, and identify an operator that allows you to "unroll" this surface to a construction plane; in Rhino, UnrollSrf is what you need. Select the surface and the original circle a, and apply this transformation; you should get an object resembling the one on the left: Extract the two "broken" edges of the surface as straight curves, and draw a circle that has the same center and diameter as the arc produced by unrolling the curve we selected alongside with the cone. This will be your virtual pitch circle, on which you will have to construct a regular tooth profile using the approach outlined earlier on. You can start by simulating the appropriate tooth profile (center, above), and then by making a planar array to complete the gear (right). The only difference is that before making the array, you need to rotate the profile by 90° to touch one of the extracted edges; and then make a radial array consisting of tooth_count copies that fill an angle of 360° / length_of_virtual_pitch_circle * length_of_circle_a, rather than the usual 360°. When done, truncate the parts that stick outside the edges, and you should be all set. To wrap up this process, you need to position the created gear profile over the unrolled surface again, making sure that it is aligned correctly. Next, use an operator that will map the curve back onto the original conical surface, using the unrolled geometry as a reference. In Rhino, this is accomplished with FlowAlongSrf. Just make sure that you select matching locations on the reference and destination surface, and if you did it right, you should be able to get something of this sort: You can delete the cone and all the helper surfaces at this point, and repeat the same procedure to generate the other gear. In the end, you should be seeing a result that resembles this: Neat, eh? You can now create a scaled copy of each outline along the appropriate axis, using a 3D scaling operator with the origin set at the point where the axes intersect; be careful with this step, as using an incorrect origin will result in gears that would not mesh. With this step out of the way, the scaled copy and the original can be then lofted together, and each of them can be individually extruded toward any point behind the gear to create a cap surface. A few extra moves to trim and cap everything neatly, and you should have a final result in front of you: Sweet! Worm gears are an interesting animal. On one hand, they offer extremely high reduction ratios, which makes them quite attractive for robotics: every turn of the input shaft advances the output gear just by a single tooth. On the other hand, they generally boast very poor efficiency due to significant friction - 30-40% being the norm. From the design standpoint, these gears are fairly unremarkable; the output gear is generated the same way you would make any other spur gear, while the input gear - or more accurately, the input screw - is essentially a rack tooth that is wrapped around a spiral path, with a tooth_width * 2 pitch between the turns: Depending on the thickness of the output gear and the diameter of the input screw, the profile used to generate the output gear may need to be corrected slightly, based on a 2D projection of the trimmed, meshing section of the screw. You should be able to create all this with no help by now; operators such as Sweep1 and Silhouette in Rino are about everything you need. The only complication for CNC machining is that as opposed to spur and bevel gears, the input screw needs a two-part mold. Helical gears are essentialy spur gears - but (literally!) with a twist. Instead of having their teeth extruded along the axis of rotation, the top and bottom profiles are rotated in relation to each other, and then lofted to form a twisted gear. The twisting may be done in a straight line (left) or in a curved fashion (center): The point of this modification is that each gear will now engage more gradually, thus reducing the amount of noise and vibration produced under load, this matters particularly in automotive applications and other situations where steel gears transfer high torques at high speeds. On the flip side, this geometry means that the gears act like a wedge, and exert substantial axial forces on the assembly they are coupled to; a double helical layout, also known as herringbone (above, right) works around that to a large extent. Helical gears are relatively difficult to make using simple, CNC-machined molds; for optimal results, the mold would need to be split into four to six parts. It is easier to machine them directly using a rotary axis - but in any case, the benefits of using this class of gears are negligible in small-scale robotics work. Gears that mesh with timing belts are constructed in a manner fairly similar to a normal gear meshing with a rack, but their shape is not entirely symmetrical. MXL timing belts use 40° teeth with a pitch of 2.03 mm. Addendum of the timing belt is approximately 0.5 mm; the dedendum is zero. The width of base of the tooth (at the pitch circle / line of the belt) is around 1.2 mm, leaving just around 0.8 mm in between the teeth. The solid section above the gears is usually around 0.7 mm thick. Of course, the belts are made of rubber and will easily conform to pulleys even if the dimensions are slightly off - so you don't need to obsess over it as much as you'd have to with rigid gears. It is possible to adjust the speed or torque of a motor by employing just a single pair of gears, but doing so is often impractical: for example, if you have a motor that nominally runs at 10,000 RPM, and want to get down to 100 RPM - a reduction of 100:1 - you would need to mesh an input gear with about 10 teeth to an output gear with no fewer than 1,000. Assuming that the width of a single tooth is 0.6 mm, the diameter of the latter gear would be almost 50 cm - oops! To solve this problem, it is common to build gearboxes that employ multiple stages; each stage reduces the speed by a more reasonable factor - usually between 2:1 and 5:1 - and then powers the next stage that performs the same trick again. The gains are exponential: if one stage gives us 4:1, then two will offer a 16:1 reduction; three will yield 64:1; and four would get us down to 256:1. The most rudimentary type of a gearbox is the offset-gear arrangement shown on the left; you can check out a practical example of this design here. This approach works well, but tends to take up space; a simple modification, shown on the right, is to stack the gears alternating between two shared axles, instead (example): Offset gear transmissions of this sort are simple and adequate for most needs; for instance, Tinybot mk III uses them exclusively. Having said that, every now and then, you may wish for something more compact and self-contained. If you are pressed for space, it makes sense to consider a planetary gearbox. There are several possible ways to design such a mechanism, but the most practical arrangement relies on a small, centrally placed sun gear coupled with the input shaft; that gear is surrounded by several planets, and these planet gears in turn roll inside a stationary internal gear known as annulus or ring: Of course, this design makes little or no sense if the planets just run freely; the output stage is created by creating a carriage that slides onto the planet gears, often using a sleeve bearing. The transmission ratio of such a mechanism will be tooth_cntsun / tooth_cntannulus - and that's quite a good result in such a small envelope. Just as importantly, additional stages of a planetary gearbox can be packed tightly on top of each other, resulting in a form factor that is pretty hard to beat. To better illustrate the practical aspects of making a planetary gearbox, you may want to check out this rendering of the design I have been using in my projects for quite a little while: Of course, planetary gearboxes are no silver bullet; they are about 2-3 times more compact than offset gears, and outperform them in some ways, but it's possible to run into situations where an even higher ratio would be desirable - but where the poor efficiency of worm gears and other types of screw-based actuators is hard to swallow. Of all the more exotic transmission systems, the most promising one is probably the cycloidal drive. This device easily attains ratios of 100:1 or more in a single stage by brilliantly exploiting eccentric motion of a large gear in a comparably-sized "cage": I have a separate page describing this particular design in more detail, so I won't repeat all the information here. Rest assured, cycloidal drive systems have some substantial downsides - for example, they tend to introduce vibration, and require subminiature ball bearings to isolate the input shaft from the eccentric gear. Nevertheless, when out of mainstream options, they are worth a try. By now, you should be well-equipped to get ahead with almost any electromechanical project you can think of; the only question is where to start. In the world of robotics, the single most important choice is probably the mode of locomotion; everything else - from the selection of sensors, to power sources, to data processing capabilities - follows from that. In the last section of this chapter, it makes sense to quickly run through the options you have. In all likelihood, your initial projects should probably be wheeled. It is tempting to try something bolder, but until you are familiar with the dynamic properties of plastics, and have several precision robots under your belt, it's really the best choice. Some of the common approaches to wheeled robots include: Differential steering: in this design, the two front wheels are individually hooked up to two motors; the rear wheels are typically spinning freely. When the motors are rotating at the same speed, the robot drives in a straight line; speed differences result in the chassis banking to the left or to the right. The rear wheels typically need to be equipped with rotary encoders or optointerrupters to detect and compensate for unintented fluctuations in motor speed, and to sense loss of traction. The main disadvantage of this design is that during sharp turns, the non-powered wheels will be dragged sideways, which may lead to loss of registration with the environment. The problem can be avoided by using swivel wheels - or even eliminating the rear wheels completely and lowering the center of mass so that the device is stable with just two; but all these solutions make it much harder to maintain a robust feedback loop. That last problem may be overcome by using Mecanum wheels - but the price tag may be hard to swallow. Car-style steering: in this arrangement, the front wheels are spinning freely; a rigid linkage operated by a motor allows them to turned left and right while a separate motor powers the rear wheels. Position sensors places on the front wheels provide a feedback loop. This is the arrangement used in Tinybot mk III. The approach is simple and sweet, which is precisely why it's so popular in the real world. That said, not all is roses: for accurate, slip-free turns, you may still have to incorporate Ackermann linkages and a differential on the rear axle. This adds more complexity than you could be expecting. Fully reorientable drivetrain: this approach relies on a drivetrain with a system of linkages that allows every wheel to be repositioned to accommodate motion in a particular direction. A simple and economical design of this type, using only three motors and permitting on-the-spot 360° turns, is employed in my Omnibot. The only disadvantage of the specific approach used in Omnibot is that the robot needs to come to a stop before changing direction. In situations where this is a significant problem, additional motors may be used to independently control the position of each wheel. Wheeled robots aside, legged creatures have some undeniable appeal. These robot designs tend to pose a range of challenges related to space management, torque requirements, obstacle sensing, and the creation of practical movement algorithms. Sure - it is relatively easy to bolt a bunch of expensive servos on top of a simple frame - but going beyond that point is usually fraught with peril. Still, if you want to give it a try, your basic choices are: Biped locomotion: achieving a natural, stable, and useful walking gait probably requires at least 4-5 degrees of freedom per leg, packed in a very narrow envelope - as well as a bunch of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and contact or current sensors to detect problems while it's still possible to recover. Because of this, and because of the algorithmic complexity of dynamically stable biped motion, most of the designs you can see tend to cut a lot of corners; using oversized feet to achieve static stability, or executing turns in a large number of small and awkward movements, is a common pattern. Quadruped and beyond: with four or more legs, it is relatively easy to create a design capable of moving in any direction without the need for sophisticated stability control. At least three degrees of freedom per leg are probably required to achieve efficient walking gaits (making turns, climbing obstacles, etc), but some success on flat surfaces can be achieved with only two degrees. Hexapods seem to be particularly popular with hobbyists - perhaps because of their sinister look? Of course, a number of designs for "scuttling" robots with one or less than one degree for freedom per leg can be found on the Internet - but they are usually not any more practical than a wind-up toy. These movement modes aside, there is a long tail of exotic inventions that are worth at least reading about. We have hopping pogo stick robots; several well-publicized ball-balancing units; a bunch of levitating designs that leverage air cushions, magnetic fields, or vibration; insanely cool crawling robots; and a large selection of flying and sailing ones. And hey - why not add something of your own to that list? We're done with the technical stuff, but stay with me for a bit longer: even for DIYers, workplace safety is no laughing matter. You will be dealing with power tools and reactive chemicals, and so if you want to pursue this hobby, there are inherent risks you simply have to understand and accept. It's entirely possible to lose an eye or set your house on fire; there are certain common-sense steps you can take to minimize the probability of mishaps, but the odds will never go down to zero. It is also your sole responsibility to investigate and follow all the applicable HOA rules, city ordinances, and other regulations - especially as they relate to purchasing laboratory supplies and chemicals, the use of power tools, and the disposal of unreacted chemicals. In many places, the laws are sensible or non-existent; but exceptions happen. If you accidentally ignore a piece of obscure, boneheaded legislation - well, nine out of ten times, nobody will know or care, but do you really want to be that one unlucky guy? OK. With all that in mind, this chapter provides a quick but non-authoritative overview of some of the most obvious safety considerations and health risks for CNC machining and resin casting. There are no guarantees that this information is accurate, complete, or up-to-date, so do your own research. Do not blindly trust one random dude on the Internet! Small CNC mills are fairly safe, compared to most other power tools - but you still need to read and follow the instruction manual, and in general, exercise common sense in everything you do. The primary risks are getting your hand pinched between the rotating tool and the workpiece, or between any other moving parts; having loose clothing or hair caught by the spindle; or being hit by any debris ejected during the cutting process. Becaue of this, you should really stay clear of the machine while it's running a job - after all, you have no business fiddling with it. If you really need to make some sort of an adjustment, or perhaps simply vacuum off accumulated shavings, it's imperative to pause the cutting process first. It is also a very good idea to wear basic eye protection at all times; although the odds of a broken tool or other sharp material hitting your eye are very low, the damage can be significant. All that aside, high-speed CNC lathes and high-power CNC mills (over 1 kW or so) have their own safety rules that I will not cover here. These devices are often powerful enough to break bones, sever limbs, or eject a loose workpiece with a speed sufficient to kill or maim. If you have one of these, the use of robust safety covers made out of sheet metal, polycarbonate, or wood, is definitely a must. Any type of dust can aggravate existing respiratory conditions; prolonged and heavy exposure may also lead to the development of brand new ones. That said, most of the noteworthy CNC stock materials give off relatively little airborne particles when machined in a sensible way - and so, your overall exposure to nuisance dust will probably not change in a major way. Lifelong exposures to wood dust are associated with nasal cancer, so reasonable dust management is advisable for wood-related projects. When working with prototyping boards such as RenShape 460, airborne dust is produced in modest quantities and has no known, specific health risks, but it's still probably good to keep it in check. Covering the mill with plastic sheeting for the duration of the job (well clear of any rotating parts and inlet vents) is a simple dust management trick; building or buying a proper enclosure is an option, too. When containment is impractical, a simple N95 particulate respirator (link) should offer protection. Of course, there are materials that pose an elevated risk; to avoid really unpleasant surprises, always investigate the substances you are milling, sanding, or otherwise dispersing in the air. You should be particularly wary of anything that contains crystalline silica (quartz), asbestos, elemental metals, toxic pigments, and any other harmful substances that may be absorbed through the lungs. Note: whie crystalline silica (quartz) is a significant danger when inhaled, there is no compelling evidence that amorphous glass products, such as milled glass fibers or 3M glass microspheres, share the same risk. You still don't want to breathe any of that stuff in, but these fillers should be safe to use in their intended way - and a tiny amount of dust should be OK. Vacuum isn't particularly dangerous to work with, but you should be aware of the risk of implosion. Plastic vacuum chambers should be inspected for cracking or crazing, and should never be exposed to high temperatures, substantial quantities of solvents, strong acids and bases, and so on. Sketchy-looking or homebrew chambers can be secured with packing tape, shrink-wrap foil, fabric, and similar materials that will retain debris if things go wrong. Other than that, you have very little to worry about; oh, if you are working in a confined space, it may make sense to vent the vacuum pump to the outside, so that the relatively small quantities of gases liberated from the resin - as well as the fine mist of mineral oil from the pump itself - don't end up right under your nose. Pressure casting is more dangerous; that's in part because the pressure differentials are much higher than for vacuum casting (especially if something goes wrong), and because all the energy is released outward if the container fails. Because of this, you should never try to rig your own pressure chambers or any other parts of the system, and not even think about removing any safety valves, regulators, and so on. Follow the instructions religiously, especially when it comes to draining the compressor; do not exceed manufacturer-provided pressure ratings; always double-check that the system is depressurized before trying to open the chamber; and disconnect everything completely when not in use. With common-sense precautions, catastrophic failure is unlikely - but rest assured, bad things have happened to quite a few people who should have known better. Oh, one more thing: if you are inclined to get a nitrogen tank for blanketing resin containers in storage, go for a small one - capacity of 1 cubic meter (40 cubic ft) is more than enough. Store it horizontally or attach it to the wall to make sure it can't fall over, and always use a regulator. Platinum cure silicones are believed to be essentially harmless; both the siloxane resin and the catalyst are non-reactive and show virtually no toxicity in animal studies. You should always read material safety datasheets for the specific product you are using, but chances are, the only risk you have to worry about is that the material is sticky, and spills can be annoying to clean up (naphtha and other nonpolar solvents can help). Beyond basic workplace hygiene, no special precautions should be necessary. Now, I don't recommend using condensation cure silicones, but if you decided to choose that option, you should be aware that they often use a small amount of dibutyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin dineodecanoate, or a similar tin(IV) compound, to catalyze the reaction. The substance is corrosive, and more troublingly, exhibits some chronic toxicity. It is present at around 5% in the catalyst component, and usually at less than 1% in the finished product - but since it will leach out in favorable conditions, you should probably not be using condensation cure silicones to make anything that is routinely worn or handled by humans, or that comes into contact with food. When mixing these resins, it's best to use latex or vinyl gloves; basic eye protection is not a bad idea, too. Storing the catalyst in a suitable cabinet and out of reach of children is important, too. Polyurethane resins consist of several very distinctive components, and it's probably useful to discuss them separately. Here's what you can typically find in the MSDS: Isocyanates: polyurethane formulations used for prototyping normally rely on fairly non-volatile isocyanates, such as liquefied methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), hydrogenated MDI (HMDI / DMDI), or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI); products where these isocyanates are already partly polymerized are common, and in this case, the prepolymer may be not listed in the MSDS at all. In general, all these substances are fairly reactive, can be damaging to mucous membranes, and upon longer exposures, will irritate skin. Fortunately, they polymerize to form an inert substance soon after being exposed to water, alcohols, and many other common substances - so they pose little danger to the environment, and do not bioaccumulate. Isocyanates tend to be pretty dangerous if inhaled - enough to earn some of the water-clear HMDI and IPDI formulations a nice "toxic" label in Canada and in the EU. Nevertheless, the extremely low vapor pressure of these chemicals - around one million times lower than water - means that if you are using them for casting reasonably sized parts at room temperature, you have very little to worry about. Within the scope of this guide, the main things to avoid is getting the substance into your eyes and spilling it in large quantities. Use eye protection, wear latex or vinyl gloves, and keep your workplace safe and clutter-free. Now, as hinted earlier, several manufacturers resort to more reactive and more volatile isocyanates, such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI); I recommend avoiding these, but if you have no choice, really good ventilation, gloves, and safety glasses are absolutely a must. Note: a small proportion of industry workers frequently exposed to significant concentrations of isocyanates eventually develop hypersensitivity to the compound. Although this is very unlikely to happen when working with room temperature casting formulations, you should obviously seek medical attention if you have difficulty breathing within several hours of working with this or any other exotic chemical. Polyols / polyetheramines: most polyester or polyether polyol compositions are viscous, non-reactive, non-volatile fluids with relatively high molecular weight, chemically related to substances such as propylene glycol, glycerine, xylitol, and so on. They tend to have rather low toxicity in their intended use, and aren't particularly reactive. Not all products are the same - but unless something stands out in the MSDS, you probably don't have to worry (of course, common sense still applies). Some systems may also use lower molecular weight amines as crosslinkers, or higher molecular weight polyetheramines to replace traditional polyols. Low molecular weight amines tend to be a bit more biologically active and irritating; a chlorine-containing amine originally used in many polyurethane formulations - 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) - was found to be a probable human carcinogen. A number of less reactive replacements emerged since then, and are expected to be much safer based on their chemical structure and animal data. In other words, there is no reason to panic, but it definitely makes sense to handle the formulations with some respect. A good sign of high amine content is a yellow-to-caramel color of the polyol component, alongside with a slight but disagreeable smell. Catalysts: these substances are of special interest, because as opposed to the core reagents outlined above, they usually remain as-is in the cured product - and if the circumstances are right, may leach out of it in small quantities, particularly out of Shore A elastomers. Modern polyurethane chemistry is usually catalyzed with much less than 1% of a carboxylate of bismuth, zinc, tin(II), or a related metal; or with a handful of reasonably selective amines, imidazoles, and so on. Most of the contemporary metal-based catalysts are extremely unlikely to be of any concern - especially at the concentrations used in the resin. The non-metal catalysts have also been studied extensively and carry no known risks at these levels - but as noted earlier, they belong to large and interesting families of bioactive compounds. As a relic of bygone days, several manufacturers still resort to toxic or bioaccumulative organometal catalysts, such as mercury neodecanoate or dibutyltin dilaurate; for example, that's the case for many products from Smooth-On and Freeman. In theory, the cured plastic should be safe to handle under normal circumstances. In practice, the mobility of the organomercury compound may be increased by factors such as incorrect mixing proprtions, UV degradation, exposure to elevated temperatures, or the action of solvents and household chemicals. In the end, I certainly wouldn't use the latter class of resins for jewelry, toys, or food applications - and I wouldn't want to worry about the exposure due to spills and other workshop accidents. I generally recommend staying away from such products altogether, especially since the alternatives have gotten much better over the years. It's not that mercury-catalyzed products are likely to maim you, but they introduce a small, preventable, incremental health risk. When in doubt about the catalyst used, simply check the MSDS to confirm. Note: if you are purchasing any concentrated catalysts or inhibitors to modify the performance of your resins (as discussed in section 4.4.4), be sure to do your homework. For example, common bismuth, zinc, and tin(II) carboxylates are believed to have very modest acute toxicity and no major chronic risks. Many other organometal catalysts - for example, based on tin(IV), cobalt, or mercury - are something you really don't want to keep around in concentrated form. Triethylenediamine and its friends sit somewhere in between: they are flammable, irritating, and fairly reactive, but probably not particularly toxic per se. Plasticizers, fillers, surfactants, etc: while most resins don't contain many other questionable additives, it's useful to briefly scan the MSDS for anything else out of the ordinary. For example, several manufacturers add phthalate plasticizers - such as butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) or dibutyl phthalate (DBP) - to some of the more flexible polyurethane rubber formulations. While these substances have very low acute toxicity and were not shown to be conclusively harmful to humans, animal studies raise some worries about long-term subchronic exposure through children toys, food-contact items, and so on - a situation vaguely reminiscent of the controvery around bisphenol A (BPA). No need to panic, but educate yourself and decide what's your tolerance for such peripheral risks. Residual solvents: some resins may contain small quantities of solvents that are left over from the manufacturing process or have been intentionally added to help with mixing or degassing. This may include xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, etc. Although the solvents are harmful upon prolonged, heavy exposure, the amounts present in the material are usually tiny (under 0.5%) and probably do not pose any serious concern. As with any chemicals, you should avoid mixing polyurethanes - and isocyanates in particular - with potentially incompatible substances; as hinted earlier, this includes alcohols, water, but also strong bases, oxidizers, amines, and metal salts. Rapid polymerization, decomposition, or other funny developments may ensue. Isocyanates also decompose in a matter of minutes in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), so do not use this solvent as a carrier for dyes, catalysts, and so forth. In the same vein, don't mix unreasonable quantities of polyurethane resins in a single batch. Runaway exothermic reactions can become dangerous if the resin gets so hot that the mixing container melts away, or something catches fire. If you need to dispose of a large quantity of unwanted resin, polymerize it in batches; or at the very least, use a large, shallow pan and work outdoors, away from other humans and flammable stuff. Last but not least, because of their irritant properties, uncured resins should be stored safely, and kept out of reach of children and other creatures other than the intended user. These considerations aside, cured polyurethanes are one of the safer, more stable, and least controversial plastics out there. Even if you mess up the mixing ratio, the unreacted isocyanates will simply eventually react with moisture, unreacted polyols will not pose a threat, and nothing horribly bad should be leaching out of the material otherwise. Like most plastics, and organic materials in general, polyurethanes release a fair amount of toxic substances during thermal decomposition - carbon monoxide being by far the most significant problem - so try to resist the urge to burn them if at all possible. Throughout this guide, I have mentioned quite a few chemicals that won't be covered in this chapter in special detail. If you plan on getting any of them, you should take care to obtain and read the appropriate material safety datasheets, and understand all the associated risks. In no particular order, here are some of the things you should know: Epoxy resins: many of these products use corrosive and somewhat volatile compounds. Chronic toxicity may be a concern with daily exposure. When mixing larger quantities, beware of significant exotherm - it's usually more pronounced than in polyurethanes. Polyester resins: styrene is highly volatile and flammable, and its vapors are harmful. On top of that, the standard catalyst is a strong oxidizer, and the resin typically cures with an extremely pronounced exotherm. Pigments and dyes: toxic pigments based on lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel are available on the market, but should be avoided. Shop specifically for modern, less harmful alternatives. Avoid pigments that contain crystalline silica of respirable size - and in any case, handle the material with care. Glass fibers: thin strands of glass are easily embedded in the skin, and can give you an annoying but generally harmless rash that takes 2-3 days to go away; getting the material into eyes can be a more serious issue, so use gloves, clean up promptly, and don't touch your face until then. If you get a rash, scratching it will usually only push the fibers deeper; soaking the affected area in water and applying an over-the-counter anti-itch cream (antihistamine) will offer relief. Common solvents, glues, demolding agents: unless indicated otherwise, you should assume that all these products are extremely flammable and that their vapors are harmful. Prolonged exposure to very high levels of certain solvents may lead to CNS effects, reproductive toxicity, and so on; over time, lasting damage is a possibility, too. Naphtha, xylene, toluene, benzene, methylene chloride, and NMP are of special concern. All the other stuff: several substances mentioned in this guide may be described as "reasonably safe", but that doesn't necessarily mean they are non-toxic if aerosolized or ingested in significant quantities; that they don't react in funny ways with incompatible materials; or that they won't cause damage if rubbed into your eyes or skin, heated up, or mishandled in some other way. Before buying any chemicals on eBay, Amazon, or anywhere else, look up their safety datasheets first. Tip: MSDSes are targeted at industrial uses, and err heavily on the side of caution; the datasheet for table salt says that the substance is "harmful in case of ingestion"; that skin contaminated with it must be flushed with water for "at least 15 minutes"; that protective clothing and gloves should be worn at all times; and that proper ventilation is necessary. They also warn that you shouldn't let this chemical enter the environment. And that's not even the worst example: Sigma-Aldrich has a serious datasheet for pure water that says you should use proper glove removal techniques and... wash hands after handling this dastardly chemical. To fend off lawsuits, they also make sure to mention that the chemical, physical, and toxicological properties of this material have not been thoroughly investigated. Do not ignore the advice provided in these documents, but use common sense when evaluating your personal risk, and the safety measures that are appropriate given the amounts you are working with, the way you are handling the substance, the frequency of exposure, and so on. It's always good to pay close attention to LD50 values; chronic health risks; and any mentions of carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity, etc. It hopefully goes without saying that you should store all the materials discussed in this guide away from sources of ignition, excessive heat, and so on; that you need to keep them away from children; and that if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should avoid any non-essential exposure to exotic, industrial chemicals - no matter what the MSDS says. Well, that's it! I'm hoping that the content included here inspired you to some extent, or helped you solve a specific problem or two.

Microsoft, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX have announced the formation of the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at raising $30 billion in equity capital for AI infrastructure investments. This fund has the potential to mobilize up to $100 billion when including debt financing, making it one of the largest alternative investment funds ever raised. The scale of this investment underscores the magnitude of the opportunity Microsoft sees in AI infrastructure. It also highlights the company's commitment to maintaining its position as a leader in the AI race, not just through software innovation but through control of the underlying infrastructure that powers AI. The GAIIP will focus on investing in new and expanded data centers, as well as energy infrastructure to power these facilities, primarily in the United States. This strategic move by Microsoft expands the boundaries of AI competition beyond software and services into the crucial realm of infrastructure. By investing in the foundational elements of AI, Microsoft aims to enhance its cloud services, support its own AI development, and create a competitive advantage in the AI ecosystem. This infrastructure-based approach has proven successful for Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has leveraged its data center infrastructure to not only provide cloud hardware services but also to offer a wide range of software applications to customers. By controlling the entire stack - from the physical infrastructure to the software running on it - Microsoft can optimize its AI offerings for performance, cost-efficiency, and scalability. This vertical integration allows tighter control over the entire AI value chain, potentially leading to more innovative and competitive AI products and services. The profitability potential of this strategy is significant when blending data center infrastructure margins with software margins. While data centers require substantial upfront investment, the ability to layer high-margin software and services on top allows cloud providers to achieve considerable profitability. This initiative is expected to have far-reaching implications for the AI industry. It could intensify competition, potentially leading to industry consolidation as smaller AI companies may struggle to compete with the scale of infrastructure that Microsoft and its partners can provide. This move could create a significant distinction between companies like Microsoft, which are investing heavily in both infrastructure and software, and those focusing solely on software development in the AI space. Companies without access to such extensive infrastructure may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, potentially leading to a reshaping of the AI industry landscape. The GAIIP's focus on both data centers and energy infrastructure is particularly significant. Energy has emerged as the next critical frontier in the AI revolution, and the GAIIP recognizes this by including energy infrastructure in its investment strategy. As AI workloads become increasingly demanding, the need for powerful, energy-efficient data centers grows. By investing in energy infrastructure alongside data centers, Microsoft is addressing one of the key challenges in AI development: the massive energy requirements of AI computations. Data centers, the backbone of AI operations, are projected to consume an increasingly higher percentage of total U.S. electricity in the next decade. This surge in power consumption presents both a challenge and an opportunity. GAIIP’s approach not only ensures the scalability of AI technologies but also opens up opportunities for innovations in energy production, distribution, and management. Moreover, this investment strategy aligns with the growing trend of sustainability in technology. By focusing on energy infrastructure alongside data centers, Microsoft can potentially develop more environmentally friendly AI solutions, addressing concerns about the carbon footprint of AI technologies. By investing in new sources of power for these facilities, the partnership aims to create a more resilient and efficient energy ecosystem that can support the exponential growth of AI. The GAIIP aims to set a new standard for AI investments, positioning the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. As global demand for AI capabilities continues to surge, these investments will likely drive economic growth, create jobs, and foster innovation in the AI sector. It is important to emphasize that the capital required for AI infrastructure and energy needs surpasses what any single company or government can finance. This partnership is expected to advance technology while enhancing national competitiveness, security, and economic prosperity. In conclusion, Microsoft and BlackRock's partnership to create this $30 billion AI infrastructure fund represents a strategic expansion of the AI competitive landscape. By investing in the foundational infrastructure of AI, Microsoft is positioning itself to dominate not just in software and services but in the entire AI vertical stack. This move could reshape the AI industry, accelerate innovation, and solidify Microsoft's position as a leader in the AI-driven future of technology. The fund's commitment to energy infrastructure underscores the understanding that the future of AI is inextricably linked to advancements in energy technology, making it a crucial area for investment and development in the AI-driven economy.

Google parent Alphabet stock climbed Wednesday to its highest level since late July after the company toppled Wall Street’s expectations in its third-quarter earnings report which revealed record profits and revenues for the search engine giant. Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California. Shares of Alphabet rallied almost 7% by midmorning, adding more than$130 billion in market capitalization as the stock got a boost from bumper third-quarter results shared after Tuesday’s market close. The “impressive” report, as described by Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett, included $88.3 billion in revenue, with $65.9 billion in its primary Google advertising business, compared to average analyst projections of $86.4 billion in total sales and $65.4 billion in ad revenue. And the internet giant generated $2.12 earnings per share and $26.3 billion in net income, compared to estimates of a $1.84 profit per share and a $22.9 billion net profit. That was Alphabet’s best sales figure ever, topping the $86.3 billion brought in during 2023’s fourth quarter, and best profit reading ever, topping the previous record of $23.7 billion in Q1 2024. Alphabet stock had actually underperformed the S&P 500 over the last 12 months through Wednesday, gaining 37% compared to the benchmark index’s 40% over the period, underperforming digital ad rival Meta at 96% and cloud computing competitor Amazon at 44%. Factors weighing on Alphabet’s share price include concerns about antitrust probes globally and on the negative profit impact of aggressive spending in the artificial intelligence arms race. Alphabet’s stock fell 8% in the three days after its second-quarter earnings announcement despite beating analysts’ top and bottom-line estimates. Google has about a 25% market share in the global digital advertising market, according to market research firm eMarketer, and generates about twice as much in digital ad revenue as its rival Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. Fellow West Coast tech behemoths Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will report their third-quarter results after Wednesday’s and Thursday’s respective market closes in a busy week for big tech. Those five companies account for about $12 trillion, or more than a fifth, of the S&P 500’s $52 trillion combined market capitalization, in turn wielding an outsized influence on the direction of the stock market broadly. It was a dismal day for other big companies who reported earnings since the end of Tuesday’s trading session, including for Advanced Micro Devices and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, whose shares tanked more than 8% apiece.

OpenAI is undoubtedly a winner in the current artificial intelligence boom — and now it’s reportedly developing its own chips to power its growth. The ChatGPT maker is working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.53%) and Broadcom (AVGO-4.44%) to make its own in-house AI chips as demand for infrastructure grows, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. It reportedly also is adding Advanced Micro Devices’s (AMD-2.67%) AI chips to diversify supply from Nvidia (NVDA-4.20%). The company has reportedly considered ways to diversify its supply of chips and cut costs, including by raising capital for a network of chipmaking factories. But instead of the plan for foundries — which it has dropped for now — OpenAI is focusing on designing its own chips in-house, Reuters reported. OpenAI’s work with Broadcom on its first in-house chips for AI inferencing has been going on for months, people told Reuters, adding that while demand is currently higher for AI training chips, analysts expect AI inferencing to eventually take the lead. Inferencing, which comes after training, is the process of a trained AI model making predictions from new data. Two people told Reuters that OpenAI is still deciding between either developing or acquiring other features for its AI chip, and could find more chipmaking partners. OpenAI has been able to establish manufacturing capacity with TSMC through its partnership with Broadcom, Reuters reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker reportedly could have OpenAI’s first custom-designed chip by 2026, but that is not certain. Neither OpenAI, TSMC, nor Broadcom immediately responded to a request for comment.

Title: Inside Intel, CEO Pat Gelsinger fumbled the revival of an American icon

Time Published: 2024-10-29T19:50:18Z
Full Content:
Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake. Intel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan’s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement. Instead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger – who hopes to restore Intel’s own manufacturing prowess – offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan’s precarious relations with China. “You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,” he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging US investment in US chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: “Taiwan is not a stable place.” In public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger “a bit rude.” Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honour the discount, the sources said: about 40 percent off the US$23,000 ($35,000), 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal. Asked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a “healthy business relationship today.” TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer. Gelsinger’s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems. This account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records. Gelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel’s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or cancelling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel’s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say. And like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a "foundry," an operation that makes chips designed by other companies. But Intel’s efforts to regain manufacturing leadership with a chip-production process called 18A have faced delays and technical problems, with some customers so far declining to use it. Intel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview. “Pat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,” Intel said in a statement. “3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress – and we’re going to finish the job.” Intel’s revenue shrivelled to US$54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose US$3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at US$22.92 on Monday, off 66 percent from a peak hit in Gelsinger’s first months as CEO. The crash in Intel’s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs. Intel said it won’t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to US$45 billion in US support, led the market for AI PC chips, and “achieved a historic pace” of innovation. Intel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it “expects to return to process leadership in 2025” with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the “usage of rumours, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for ‘sources’ to gain negative commentary on Intel.” Customers have little incentive to bet on Intel’s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. “If you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,” Hari said. Still, US Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said in September US manufacturing represents a supply-chain “insurance policy” that major chip designers would pay for. “They should want US-made leading-edge chips,” she said. Intel’s stumbles have implications for US industrial policy. Gelsinger’s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under US control on US soil. A White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than US$11 billion in proposed funding under the act. Gelsinger’s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel’s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to “going to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.” Gelsinger became Intel’s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring. Intel changed while he was away. Its so-called “Grovian” culture of constructive confrontation – one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data – faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI. His return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly seven percent on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge. Intel, in Gelsinger’s view, needed to execute at a “torrid” pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel’s company store, with the word “torrid” emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said. The bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel’s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest US$20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel’s manufacturing excellence. Gelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidise American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another US$20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel’s commitment in the state might reach US$100 billion to create “the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.” 'Five reasons to believe' Chip sales boomed in the Covid-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel’s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25 percent in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centres to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house. Gelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out “five reasons to believe” in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to “believe deeply in your heart and soul Intel’s best days are ahead.” Intel said Gelsinger “consistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.” Gelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet’s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the US, three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, two of the people said. But after Intel’s outlook worsened in 2022, the company cancelled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action. Sandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel’s data centre group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganisation required her to make “decisions about the entire portfolio.” Intel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter. Gelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save US$3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs. Under his watch, Intel’s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the “unprecedented pace” at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring. ChatGPT moment Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history’s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia’s chips power the data centres behind ChatGPT. Originally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel. Nvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a US$1 trillion valuation. Intel’s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses. Gelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to US$16.9 million in 2023 from US$11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows. Around this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel’s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator – a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip – designed in-house and made by TSMC – as an alternative to Nvidia’s often scarce GPUs. Teams at Intel estimated it could sell at most US$500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least US$1 billion at a time when Nvidia’s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying. Gelsinger touted the US$1 billion figure in public. On Intel’s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of “surging demand for AI products.” He added: “Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over US$1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.” According to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell US$1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said. Intel said Gelsinger’s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. “No company converts 100 percent of its pipeline into revenue,” Intel said. “We make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams – and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.” As recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than US$2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than US$500 million. At times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks – including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn’t happen, the sources said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel. Intel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported. On Intel’s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data centre chief, told Reuters: “It’s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.” Intel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs. Manufacturing woes Gelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than US$60 billion. Then, this summer [winter, in Australia], he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans. Intel’s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms – 18A – also remains a question mark. Some customers have been disappointed by what they’ve seen of 18A. When one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom, sent foot-wide wafers through Intel’s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20 percent of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC’s early-stage yields. Broadcom told Reuters it has “not concluded” its evaluation of whether to use Intel’s foundry. On the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process. A recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said. Apple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment. Intel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A. Gelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a “lot of work ahead,” but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan. “I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,” Gelsinger told Reuters in August. “Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.”

Title: Inside Intel, CEO Pat Gelsinger fumbled the revival of an American icon

Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake. Intel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan’s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement. Instead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger – who hopes to restore Intel’s own manufacturing prowess – offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan’s precarious relations with China. “You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,” he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging US investment in US chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: “Taiwan is not a stable place.” In public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger “a bit rude.” Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honour the discount, the sources said: about 40 percent off the US$23,000 ($35,000), 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal. Asked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a “healthy business relationship today.” TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer. Gelsinger’s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems. This account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records. Gelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel’s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or cancelling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel’s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say. And like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a "foundry," an operation that makes chips designed by other companies.

And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement. Instead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger – who hopes to restore Intel’s own manufacturing prowess – offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan’s precarious relations with China. “You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,” he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging US investment in US chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: “Taiwan is not a stable place.” In public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger “a bit rude.” Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honour the discount, the sources said: about 40 percent off the US$23,000 ($35,000), 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal. Asked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a “healthy business relationship today.” TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer. Gelsinger’s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems. This account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records. Gelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel’s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or cancelling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel’s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say. And like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a "foundry," an operation that makes chips designed by other companies. But Intel’s efforts to regain manufacturing leadership with a chip-production process called 18A have faced delays and technical problems, with some customers so far declining to use it. Intel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview. “Pat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,” Intel said in a statement. “3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress – and we’re going to finish the job.” Intel’s revenue shrivelled to US$54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose US$3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at US$22.92 on Monday, off 66 percent from a peak hit in Gelsinger’s first months as CEO. The crash in Intel’s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs. Intel said it won’t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to US$45 billion in US support, led the market for AI PC chips, and “achieved a historic pace” of innovation. Intel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it “expects to return to process leadership in 2025” with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the “usage of rumours, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for ‘sources’ to gain negative commentary on Intel.” Customers have little incentive to bet on Intel’s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. “If you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,” Hari said. Still, US Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said in September US manufacturing represents a supply-chain “insurance policy” that major chip designers would pay for. “They should want US-made leading-edge chips,” she said. Intel’s stumbles have implications for US industrial policy. Gelsinger’s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under US control on US soil. A White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than US$11 billion in proposed funding under the act. Gelsinger’s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel’s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to “going to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.” Gelsinger became Intel’s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring. Intel changed while he was away. Its so-called “Grovian” culture of constructive confrontation – one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data – faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI. His return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly seven percent on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge. Intel, in Gelsinger’s view, needed to execute at a “torrid” pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel’s company store, with the word “torrid” emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said. The bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel’s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest US$20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel’s manufacturing excellence. Gelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidise American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another US$20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel’s commitment in the state might reach US$100 billion to create “the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.” 'Five reasons to believe' Chip sales boomed in the Covid-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel’s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25 percent in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centres to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house. Gelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out “five reasons to believe” in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to “believe deeply in your heart and soul Intel’s best days are ahead.” Intel said Gelsinger “consistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.” Gelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet’s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the US, three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, two of the people said. But after Intel’s outlook worsened in 2022, the company cancelled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action. Sandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel’s data centre group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganisation required her to make “decisions about the entire portfolio.” Intel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter. Gelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save US$3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs. Under his watch, Intel’s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the “unprecedented pace” at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring. ChatGPT moment Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history’s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia’s chips power the data centres behind ChatGPT. Originally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel. Nvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a US$1 trillion valuation. Intel’s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses. Gelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to US$16.9 million in 2023 from US$11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows. Around this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel’s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator – a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip – designed in-house and made by TSMC – as an alternative to Nvidia’s often scarce GPUs. Teams at Intel estimated it could sell at most US$500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least US$1 billion at a time when Nvidia’s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying. Gelsinger touted the US$1 billion figure in public. On Intel’s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of “surging demand for AI products.” He added: “Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over US$1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.” According to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell US$1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said. Intel said Gelsinger’s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. “No company converts 100 percent of its pipeline into revenue,” Intel said. “We make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams – and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.” As recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than US$2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than US$500 million. At times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks – including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn’t happen, the sources said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel. Intel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported. On Intel’s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data centre chief, told Reuters: “It’s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.” Intel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs. Manufacturing woes Gelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than US$60 billion. Then, this summer [winter, in Australia], he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans. Intel’s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms – 18A – also remains a question mark. Some customers have been disappointed by what they’ve seen of 18A. When one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom, sent foot-wide wafers through Intel’s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20 percent of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC’s early-stage yields. Broadcom told Reuters it has “not concluded” its evaluation of whether to use Intel’s foundry. On the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process. A recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said. Apple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment. Intel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A. Gelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a “lot of work ahead,” but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan. “I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,” Gelsinger told Reuters in August. “Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.”

Title: Pfizer is racing to get in on the weight loss drug boom

Pfizer (PFE-0.19%) offered up some more details on its weight loss drug pipeline on Tuesday during a call with investors after it posted its third-quarter earnings report. During the call, the pharma giant shared more information on its three weight loss drug candidates and where they stand on the development cycle. Pfizer joins several other pharmaceutical companies working to introduce their own incretin weight loss meds, first popularized by Ozempic, in an effort to disrupt the weight loss duopoly currently held by Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.64%) and Eli Lilly (LLY-0.34%) . Incretin drugs are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications have turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Morgan Stanley (MS-0.29%) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1s will reach $105 billion by 2030. In addition to Pfizer, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX-0.63%), Roche, and Amgen, are all now developing weight loss meds. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also working on developing their own next-gen weight loss drugs. Pfizer seems to be primarily focused on incretin pills. Weight loss medications that already on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. But a pill could help with current supply constraints and open the market to patients hesitant to taking injections. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight loss pill to to enter the market. “If [danuglipron] moves fast, based on what we know right now, we should be the second oral into the market, provided that the first one will be successful and the other ones will not come before us,” Bourla said. “But so far, this is what the situation looks like. So, there is no doubt that if successful, we will have a decent market share of oral.” Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. This is the same hormone that is stimulated by drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late stage trial due to a high rate of side effects. The company instead tested modified versions of the drug and has selected one to move forward to clinical trials where various doses of the pill will be tested. Bourla said that more details from these new trial will be shared in early 2025. Bourla also said that company is testing at least two other weight loss pills in early stage clinical trials. One is once-daily GLP-1 pill that is currently in a phase 1 trial. The other one, a pill that blocks the gut hormone GIP, is expected to advance into a phase 2 trial this year. Pfizer chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten said on the call that this pill with a different weight loss mechanism could potentially offer “better tolerability and more efficacy.” An experimental therapy from Amgen (AMGN+1.74%), MariTide, works partly by blocking GIP, while also stimulating GLP-1. An early stage trial of MariTide found that users on the drug lost average of 14.5% of their weight in about 12 weeks.

Title: Nasdaq Hits New Record High as Middle East Tensions Ease and Tech Stock Optimism Grows
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/nasdaq-hits-new-record-high-as-middle-east-tensions-ease-and-tech-stock-optimism-grows/

The Nasdaq Composite hit a fresh record high on 29 October 2024, buoyed by optimism around major tech earnings and an easing of tensions in the Middle East. The tech-centric Nasdaq gained 0.7%, crossing the 18,700 mark, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, dipping by 75 points or 0.2%. Key corporate earnings announcements, especially from high-profile tech companies, are anticipated to shape market sentiment this week. Investors are closely watching for reports from Alphabet, Snap, Reddit, Chipotle, and AMD, set to release after the closing bell. Major names such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft are scheduled to report on Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. Ahead of these releases, shares of Meta and Alphabet saw gains of over 1%​. Sam Stovall, Chief Investment Strategist at CFRA Research, told CNBC that the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s recent highs come amid high valuations in the tech sector, making future earnings growth critical to justifying elevated price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Stovall noted that the market is “expensive” and that sustained growth will be necessary to support current valuations, especially within tech stocks. This week marks the busiest phase of the quarterly earnings season, with over 150 S&P 500 companies expected to report results by Friday​. Investor sentiment has also been shaped by the recent decline in oil prices, driven by eased tensions in the Middle East. As of 6:22 p.m. UTC on Tuesday, a barrel of Brent crude was trading at around $71.29, a 6.2% drop from its $76 price on Friday evening. This recent fall in oil prices signals improved stability in the Middle East, with Iranian and Israeli tensions showing signs of restraint. Sky News reported yesterday that, despite ongoing missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, recent statements by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei avoided escalating threats, while Israeli strikes on Iranian-linked targets avoided energy facilities, providing reassurance to oil markets. The lowered oil prices, now at a level not seen for most of the past two years, are expected to gradually translate to lower costs at the pump, offering potential relief for consumers. The lower energy prices have provided a boost to broader market optimism, as high fuel costs have been a persistent inflationary pressure. This has particularly benefited the Nasdaq, with investors encouraged by the prospect of lower operational costs for many tech firms, which are sensitive to both inflation and broader economic pressures.

Eric Beiley, executive managing director of The Beiley Group at Steward Partners, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): It could be a crazy week for earnings. We got tech on deck. What are your expectations? ERIC BEILEY (EB): Expectations are high. The markets are trading near their highs. For the S&P 500, the markets are saying we’ve seen good earnings so far, and then this week is critical, right? You have the big Magnificent Seven names, Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), all reporting. AM: The Mag 7 are all at or near all time highs. They’ve been a part of a big wave of growth. How high can they go? Should investors keep investing in these seven-ish tech names? EB: I would say yes, because they’ve proven over the long term to produce tremendous results for investors, for their shareholders, and they continue to grow. So, and some of them, you could argue the valuations are, are attractive here, but it’s gonna be important to see what their, what their numbers are. Clearly. AM: One of the things that I am sure we’ll get some kind of read on is their spending on AI. Do you think that the market could react badly if investors don’t see a particular result in that spending yet? Or is it too early to tell? EB: No, I think AI is a major long-term powerful trend. You can’t ignore it, right? We’ve seen it. Look at Nvidia (NVDA) now, one of the largest companies in the world as demand for their chips is off the charts. And that’s because of this AI phenomena. And so Meta (META), formerly Facebook, Amazon, they’re all in that business for the long-term, investing billions of dollars. So I think AI is a long-term trend that’s gonna be positive for the markets and investors. AM: Tech is still okay. What other recommendations do you have for investors out there? EB: Well, clearly there’s a lot going on, right? You have this Friday, you have the employment numbers. That’s gonna be very important to see the health of the economy. And that’s gonna dictate where Fed policy goes, expectations are a few more rate hikes. We’re seeing that in the yield curve and that that’s positive for asset classes in general. Lower rates is positive. Then you have the election, clearly, right? That’s gonna be massive. The markets are right now trading based on what the predictions are for the election. So that’s very important. And then after that, you have the Fed meeting to show what their thoughts are. Are they gonna cut rates again? AM: The election. It’s gonna be a thing.Is there a way that investors can prepare for that? Should they sell everything? Should they double down? Like, not to be drastic or dramatic, but what do you think? EB: Well, as a financial advisor, we look for long-term goals to meet my client’s objectives. These are 5, 10, 15, 20-year financial plans we put together. So while this election is massive and very emotional for a lot of people, you have to look at the long-term. You have to look at your own situation and make those decisions. I think traders, we’re seeing it. The trading activity is certainly active right now, predicting whether Harris or Trump wins. You’re seeing right now, in my view, the markets are predicting a Trump victory. You’re seeing certain asset classes doing well that would perform a better in a Trump presidency, AM: Such as? EB: Crypto, number one. Clearly you’re seeing that the media stock for Trump has gone up tremendously in the last just week or so. So that’s showing signs that the markets are leaning toward Trump. AM: What is the market expecting for Friday’s Job number? EB: I think a good number. The markets again are acting extremely well. You’re seeing equity prices continue to go higher. The interesting part of the market now is where the rates, right, the long end of the yield curve, the 10-year treasury yields and longer have really gone up. And that’s predicting that the economy’s gonna stay strong and healthy. And therefore, while we’ll see more rate cuts, [there will be] not as many as predicted. And so Friday’s going to I think we’ll see a strong number and so the Fed will cut rates, but a small reduction and probably pause sometime next year in their cuts. AM: Gotcha. So it sounds like we’re in a good place right now, despite all of the news that’ll be coming out. EB: The trends are very positive and trends are powerful, right? Don’t fight trends, typically, for investors. Right now, the trends are higher and you have good signals out there. You’re having good third quarter results from companies. You have a good economy, rates coming down. All of those are very positive for asset classes in general. AM: Your firm is a fan of something called ‘dividend aristocrats’. Can you tell me about what a dividend aristocrat is and what your picks are? EB: Yeah, well I’m a fan of dividend aristocrats. So these are companies that have proven to be great long term investments because they share their profits with their shareholders. So they are doing that through dividends and they’ve increased their dividend payments every year for 25 consecutive years, which is hard to do, right? Because you think back over 25 years, there’s all types of economic cycles. Companies go through ups and downs and these companies have proven to increase their dividend payouts consecutively. And so I like these companies. There are three, I like Walmart (WMT), S&P Global (SPGI), and Brown and Company, the insurance company. They’ve all outperformed the S&P 500 on a 5- and 10-year basis. So, to me, these are great long-term investments. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Wall Street is bullish on Meta earnings as analysts eye an AI boost for the tech titan

Meta delivered better-than-expected revenue and profit in its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company also made it clear it would not be slowing down on its spending while building out its AI infrastructure this year — and expects those costs to increase in 2025. "We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. "We also have strong momentum with Meta AI, Llama adoption, and AI-powered glasses." The company's revenue for the quarter was $40.59 billion, ahead of the expected $40.25 billion. Earnings per share were in at $6.06, above the expected $5.25. In its core business of advertising, Meta said its average price per ad had increased 11% year over year. However, the company missed expectations for user growth. It said daily active users grew 5% year over year to 3.29 billion. That was lower than expectations of 3.31 billion daily users. Shares dipped more than 3% following Meta's earnings call with analysts, during which Zuckerberg talked through the company's AI investment strategy and said that "this might be the most dynamic moment I've seen in our industry." The company's big bet on AI, which includes both training its own AI models and launching consumer products across its platforms powered by them, continued to drive up its costs. "We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025," Meta said. The company expects "a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet." Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li were asked questions about the hefty costs related to AI spending and infrastructure on the earnings call. Zuckerberg said Meta was building out its infrastructure faster than initially expected. While that means higher expenses reflected in its earnings, it also positions the company to continue with that pace of growth, he said. The CEO said he was "happy the team is executing well on that," even if racking up bigger expenses is "maybe not what investors want to hear." Meta expects 2024 losses from its Reality Labs segment, which is responsible for the company's AR, VR, and metaverse products, to "increase meaningfully year-over-year." The company has lost tens of billions on the initiatives over the years. Asked by an analyst if Meta was nearing "peak" losses for the division, Li didn't answer directly but said Reality Labs is "clearly one of our strategic long-term priorities." Meta has also been hiring, with its head count up 9% year-over-year. Meta said it is examining where to invest in strategic opportunities, including AI, infrastructure, and Reality Labs, while keeping an eye on ways to streamline operations elsewhere. Since late 2022, Meta has laid off more than 20,000 employees. Meta saw paid messaging grow in the third quarter and explains what's driving that growth. Meta says that "growth to WhatsApp ads remains particularly strong." The company said it's seeing a strong increase in the volume of paid conversations, with a growing number of companies using them as well as an increase in the volume of conversations. And that's it's for the earnings call. Meta's stock is trading down around 2% in after-hours trading as the call concludes. The company's CFO didn't answer if that was or wasn't the case, but said Reality Labs was "clearly one of our strategic long-term priorities" and "an area of significant investment as we build out towards the very ambitious product roadmap that we have there." Reality Labs has losses to the tune of $50 billion in the last five years. CFO Li says it's "hard to compare on an apples to apples basis" and pointed to positive conversion growth and "healthy cost per action." Ad impressions delivered across the company's apps increased 7% year-over-year. More broadly, the CFO says there are a lot of factors that go into the year-over-year growth in price per ad, including auction dynamics, the conversions the company delivers to advertisers, and if they getting more value over time. Meta cares about conversion growth, Li says. The CEO says it is "good business" to take an open-source approach and defended higher spending on building out infrastructure, though he says it's "maybe not what investors want to hear." They've received feedback that has helped them improve the AI model and also save on costs. When building out AI infrastructure, Zuckerberg says the team is executing "quite well" and has been able to build out more capacity than what was expected. "That execution makes me somewhat more optimistic that we'll be able to continue building out" at a similar pace, he says. She lists, for example, increased adoption of an internal assistant and coding agent, and potential use of AI in the company's content moderation work as small opportunities that the company hopes will turn into bigger opportunities over time. He pointed to uses in a wide variety of products and the company's core areas, such as making feeds, Reels, and ads more relevant. He's bullish on "what we view as a very, very large opportunity" with Meta's AI investments. CFO Susan Li didn't share specifics on headcount growth guidance heading into next year but said the company is looking for where to invest with an eye toward measurable ROI and strategic opportunities. Li said the company is supporting hiring in those areas by continuing to focus on opportunities to streamline operations elsewhere. (That could mean more layoffs or reorganizations to come). Meta now opens the call up to analyst questions. CFO Susan Li said the company is "investing in a portfolio of opportunities that we expect will generate returns over different time periods" and is "very optimistic." Within Reality Labs, which has lost tens of billions over the years, Meta is adapting its strategy and roadmap due to the earlier-than-expected success of its smart glasses, Li said, and the company expects to continue big spending in the division. Meta CFO Susan Li says that year-over-year headcount growth in the last quarter was primarily driven in hiring in priority areas, including infrastructure, Reality Labs, gen AI, and regulation and compliance. Zuckerberg says he's focused on making sure the company executes and takes advantage of the "massive opportunity." The mixed-reality headset, unveiled at the company's Connect developer conference in September and available as of mid-October, is a cheaper alternative to the Quest 3 at $299. "Reviews are great so far," Zuckerberg said. "Looking forward to seeing how well it does this holiday season as people get their hands on it." The Meta CEO highlighted "strong product and business momentum." He spoke, for example, of "rapid adoption" of chatbot Meta AI and Llama AI models, and said Meta continued to see "positive trends" regarding young adults on Facebook. Zuckerberg says Llama 4 model, expected to launch next year, is well into development. The company is training the new AI model "on a cluster that is bigger than 100k H100 or any cluster that has been reported publicly" — this appears to be a subtle reference to Elon Musk's xAI datacenter, which has a 100,000 cluster of AI chips. (The call quality is a bit choppy here, so if you're tuned in and hearing things cut in and out, it's not just you.) Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li will talk through the earnings starting at 5 p.m. ET and then take questions from analysts. Stay tuned… "The beat in Meta's Q3 revenue and strong Q4 guidance mean investors should remain willing to look past its spending on AI and other initiatives," said Emarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg. "The miss in its user metric, daily active people, is concerning, as Meta will need to squeeze more revenue out of its existing users as growth slows." "Looking ahead, Meta is well-positioned to do so, as its AI-powered tools are boosting engagement by helping show users more of what they like and making its ads, particularly on Reels, more effective," Enberg added. "But Meta needs to prove that it can continue to cover its AI costs as they rise next year, and any weakness in its core ad business could make investors nervous as they continue to wait for a return on Meta's bigger AI bets." For Reality Labs, Meta's division of the company leading its work in AR, VR, and the metaverse, Meta expects operating losses this year to "increase meaningfully year-over-year." In Q3, Reality Labs' operating loss was $4.4 billion. Zuckerberg has reportedly looked to reel in spending in the division. Meta's headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, an increase of 9% year-over-year, and up from 70,799 at the end of June. The company has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs since Mark Zuckerberg's "year of efficiency" in 2023. The organization has also gotten flatter as a result of management cuts after Zuckerberg complained of too many cases of "managers managing managers." Source for analyst estimates: Bloomberg Meta could face challenges ahead, particularly due to the risk that growth decelerated in the last quarter, CFRA Research said. "META has a tough bar to surpass in upcoming Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. We estimate Q3 growth decelerated to 18% from 22% in Q2 and see further deceleration to 15% in Q4 2024 and 13% in Q1 2025," CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino wrote. Still, trends in Meta's digital ad business look "healthy" overall, Zino said. CFRA raised its price target on the stock to $650 a share, implying 11% upside. Investors will be keeping a close eye on whether Meta will be able to maintain its pace of growth in the coming quarter, according to Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief US market strategist. He pointed to key metrics investors should focus on, like capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, and guidance on how and when the company would start to see a return on that spending. "That's the big question for Meta," Sekera said. "Other than that, I'll be listening for an update on growth and digital ads; they had a big benefit from ad spending in Temu and Shein over the past couple quarters, so the question is whether that growth will continue or will it start to slow." The firm previously issued a 3-star rating for the stock and a fair value of $560, implying 5% downside from current levels. Bank of America analysts expect a "modest" earnings beat from Meta on Wednesday. They forecast the firm to report as much as $47.5 billion in revenue, which would represent an 18% year-over-year increase. Meta is a "top AI pick," the analysts said in a recent note. They pointed to a handful of potential tailwinds for the company, like strong growth in Meta's AI-powered ads business, continued growth among younger users, and more AI growth opportunities in general. The bank reiterated its "Buy" rating and $630 price target on the stock, implying 7% upside from current levels. Analysts at JMP said they're bullish on Meta's coming search engine, which the company is reportedly developing to feed its AI chatbot. "Meta is uniquely well positioned to monetize search given its 200M+ active SMBs and 12M+ active advertisers," the firm wrote. "To that end, we believe Meta could offer a compelling commercial experience for search given its existing advertiser and SMB relationships while also using search intent signal to power its core advertising product on Facebook and Instagram." The firm issued an "Outperform" rating on the stock and a $635 price target, implying an 8% increase from current levels. Meta's long-term trajectory looks solid, as evidenced by the climb in the stock in recent years, according to Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik. Meta shares are up over 500% from their low in 2022, Shmulik said in a recent note. The outlook for Meta's core business also looks "constructive," he added, pointing to Meta's ad businesses, expectation that ads will launch on Threads, and other developments. "Near term risk and reward feels balanced," Shmulik wrote in a note, adding that the firm had a "perma-bull position on all things Meta." The firm issued an "Outperform" rating on the stock and a $675 price target, implying 15% upside from current levels. 3rd quarter Revenue estimate: $40.25 billion Operating income estimate: $16.33 billion 4th quarter Full-year 2024 Total expenses estimate: $97.87 billion Capital expenditure estimate: $38.06 billion Jump to

(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on) * Gelsinger's comments offended TSMC, which did not honor discount * Revenue and stock price have declined sharply under Gelsinger * Intel's 18A chip process faces delays and technical issues By Max A. Cherney, Jeffrey Dastin, Dawn Chmielewski, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis Oct 29 (Reuters) - Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake. Intel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan’s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement. Instead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger – who hopes to restore Intel’s own manufacturing prowess – offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan’s precarious relations with China. “You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,” he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging U.S. investment in U.S. chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: “Taiwan is not a stable place.” In public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger “a bit rude.” Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honor the discount, the sources said: about 40% off the $23,000, 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal. Asked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a “healthy business relationship today.” TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer. Gelsinger’s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems. This account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records. Gelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel’s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or canceling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel’s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say. And like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a "foundry," an operation that makes chips designed by other companies. But Intel’s efforts to regain manufacturing leadership with a chip-production process called 18A have faced delays and technical problems, with some customers so far declining to use it. Intel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview. “Pat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,” Intel said in a statement. “3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress – and we’re going to finish the job.” Intel’s revenue shriveled to $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose $3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at $22.92 on Monday, off 66% from a peak hit in Gelsinger’s first months as CEO. The crash in Intel’s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs. Intel said it won’t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to $45 billion in U.S. support, led the market for AI PC chips, and “achieved a historic pace” of innovation. Intel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it “expects to return to process leadership in 2025” with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the “usage of rumors, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for ‘sources’ to gain negative commentary on Intel.” Customers have little incentive to bet on Intel’s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. “If you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,” Hari said. Still, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in September U.S. manufacturing represents a supply-chain “insurance policy” that major chip designers would pay for. “They should want U.S.-made leading-edge chips,” she said. Intel’s stumbles have implications for U.S. industrial policy. Gelsinger’s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under U.S. control on U.S. soil. A White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than $11 billion in proposed funding under the act. Gelsinger’s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel’s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to “going to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.” Gelsinger became Intel’s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring. Intel changed while he was away. Its so-called “Grovian” culture of constructive confrontation – one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data – faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI. His return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly 7% on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge. Intel, in Gelsinger’s view, needed to execute at a “torrid” pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel’s company store, with the word “torrid” emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said. The bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel’s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest $20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel’s manufacturing excellence. Gelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidize American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another $20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel’s commitment in the state might reach $100 billion to create “the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.” ‘FIVE REASONS TO BELIEVE’ Chip sales boomed in the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel’s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25% in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centers to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house. Gelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out “five reasons to believe” in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to “believe deeply in your heart and soul Intel’s best days are ahead.” Intel said Gelsinger “consistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.” Gelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet’s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the U.S., three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, two of the people said. But after Intel’s outlook worsened in 2022, the company canceled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action. Sandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel’s data center group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganization required her to make “decisions about the entire portfolio.” Intel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter. Gelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save $3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs. Under his watch, Intel’s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the “unprecedented pace” at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring. CHATGPT MOMENT Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history’s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia’s chips power the data centers behind ChatGPT. Originally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel. Nvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a $1 trillion valuation. Intel’s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses. Gelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to $16.9 million in 2023 from $11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows. Around this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel’s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator – a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip – designed in-house and made by TSMC – as an alternative to Nvidia’s often scarce GPUs. Teams at Intel estimated it could sell at most $500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least $1 billion at a time when Nvidia’s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying. Gelsinger touted the $1 billion figure in public. On Intel’s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of “surging demand for AI products.” He added: “Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.” According to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell $1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said. Intel said Gelsinger’s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. “No company converts 100% of its pipeline into revenue,” Intel said. “We make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams – and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.” As recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than $2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than $500 million. At times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks – including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn’t happen, the sources said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel. Intel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported. On Intel’s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data center chief, told Reuters: “It’s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.” Intel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs. MANUFACTURING WOES Gelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than $60 billion. Then, this summer, he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans. Intel’s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms – 18A – also remains a question mark. Some customers have been disappointed by what they’ve seen of 18A. When one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom , sent foot-wide wafers through Intel’s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20% of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC’s early-stage yields. Broadcom told Reuters it has “not concluded” its evaluation of whether to use Intel’s foundry. On the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process. A recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said. Apple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment. Intel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A. Gelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a “lot of work ahead,” but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan. “I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,” Gelsinger told Reuters in August. “Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.” (Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin, Max Cherney and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; additional reporting by Milana Vinn in New York and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Claudia Parsons) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: There’s a Better Way to Express Your Anger at the Washington Post. Too Bad Most People Won’t Do It.
URL: https://slate.com/business/2024/10/washington-post-endorsement-election-cancel-jeff-bezos.html
Time Published: 2024-10-29T17:06:28Z

If you’re like me, your social media feeds for the past few days have been full of posts with screenshots of “We’ve Canceled Your Subscription” notices and comments to the effect of “This will not stand, Washington Post!” Never before have so many people—200,000, according to one report—gotten such an ecstatic hit of online righteousness out of saving themselves 200 bucks a year. These are the times that remind us of how little most people understand how journalism works. Some commenters on Facebook seem to think the paper as a whole decided not to endorse a presidential candidate this year. To the contrary: The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, forced the decision in spite of editors’ arguments in favor of publishing an endorsement of Kamala Harris that had already been written. Several of those opinion-page editors have since resigned in protest. Bezos alone is responsible for this pathetically unconvincing attempt to portray the Post as neutral in the race, and late Monday the paper published his self-defense, an unconvincing assertion that this last-minute change in editorial policy was meant to correct the perception that the Post is biased. Bezos insists that no quid pro quo was involved, but as many have pointed out, he stands to lose various lucrative government contracts should Donald Trump become president and wreak the revenge he has promised on his many perceived enemies. This is a disgraceful situation, but all these people posting on social media are doing nothing to help and in fact are only making things worse. There is, however, a simple step you could take that would both demonstrate your disapproval and rebuff a company that really makes this country worse. Rather than cancel your Post subscription, I say, cancel Amazon Prime. The Washington Post is already a struggling institution, having undergone layoffs and buyouts just last month. If 200,000 subscribers permanently bail on the paper, it may never recover. Or it may survive with much of its coverage cut back, and that may trigger a spiral into oblivion somewhere down the road as the remaining subscribers decide that a pale shadow of the Post’s former self is not worth paying for. Many bad things would follow from this, including journalists losing their jobs and the elimination of noncore sections that I value, like the Washington Post Book World. Most of all, however, there’s a lot of good, important journalism that won’t happen if the Post isn’t around (or can’t afford) to do it. Those who are showily canceling must surely be aware, thanks to their subscriptions, of the breadth and depth of the Post’s reporting. I read three or four Post articles every day, and I don’t live anywhere near D.C. In the weeks before the current scandal, I read this terrific piece about how an alarming conspiracy-addled militia group tried to take over a North Carolina town in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. I read this report, by Ben Brasch on how Florida’s health department has tried to criminalize TV stations for running ads in support of repealing the state’s draconian six-week abortion ban. I was chilled by this long profile, by Shawn Boburg and Chris Dehghanpoor, of a bullied teen convicted of running dozens of harassment campaigns against other children. The Post maintains essential databases of police shootings and mass shootings in America. It also runs substantive service journalism, like this column, by Michael J. Coren, about the threat of climate change on homeowners, with a widget that can assess the vulnerability of specific counties. When you cancel your subscription to the Post, you don’t punish Jeff Bezos. You punish the journalists who write such stories, including, ironically, the journalists who wrote and prepared to publish the very endorsement you’re so angry about. As one Post staffer told me, “The journalists who produce the Washington Post had no role in this decision, and yet they’re the only people who will be really hurt if you cancel your subscription.” And if those journalists lose their jobs, what happens to them? The most clueless subscription-cancelers of all maintain that they’ll just get jobs elsewhere. Apparently there are still people out there who don’t know that the business model for journalism is currently in free fall, with only brand-name legacy organizations, like the Post and the New York Times, able to hold on by their fingernails while still providing in-depth reporting. Last year alone, 131 local newspapers shuttered, a loss that has fostered the increasing polarization of their communities. Even if you don’t feel sorry for middle-class people losing their jobs, this is a massive civic injury. Contributing to the death of journalism will not hurt Jeff Bezos; it will just make the United States a dumber, more dangerous place. But canceling Amazon Prime, and communicating your reasons for doing so, is a step you can take that directly rebukes Jeff Bezos. There are plenty of good reasons not to patronize Amazon. And although Bezos no longer wholly owns the company, it remains the source of his fortune and therefore his power. (The Post, on the other hand, seems to be little more than his hobby.) Two hundred thousand people canceling Prime wouldn’t be catastrophic for a company that made over $40 billion on subscriptions last year. But given that Prime is the engine that runs the whole retail arm of the company, no dent in its subscriber base will go unnoticed. If the argument is that rich people care more about safeguarding their money than they do about higher principles, then if you want to hit them, show them you’re willing to hit them where they make that money, even if that means inconveniencing yourself. Unfortunately, this is a bridge too far for a lot of us. I’ve heard from a handful of very honest persons that canceling Prime calls for a “bravery” that they don’t possess. The free press is one thing, but do not come for our free two-day shipping! This is why I think canceling Prime actually speaks louder than canceling your Post subscription. It’s a genuine sacrifice, not a performative social media gesture, and one that, sadly, some people regard as more painful than losing the Post. I’m as angry as anyone about Bezos’ interference with the Post’s endorsement policy, even if the endorsement itself is pretty meaningless. It was already crystal clear from everything else the Post has published this year whom it would advise readers to vote for. But it is all that other journalism the Post has published, and that it has yet to publish, that stands the best chance of influencing the race. Embarrassing Bezos is the one thing this cancellation campaign has been able to accomplish. But in making him pay the price of a temporary shaming, I’m not ready to give up on a paper that has proved its worth to me over and over again.

Title: The Fed is likely to disappoint markets with just one more rate cut this year amid global inflation, BlackRock CEO says

The Federal Reserve will disappoint markets by cutting interest rates just one more time in 2024, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. Fink said the Fed will likely cut interest rates by 25 basis points before the end of the year amid a rise in global inflation. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25, but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said during a Tuesday panel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The market sees two more cuts this year, pricing in a 25 basis point cut at the November and December meetings, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Investors see slimmer odds of about 30% that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in December. Fink pointed to inflationary policies in the US, which he said are changing the economy's consumer-driven nature. "We have a government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost,'" he said. "Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking." His comments point to the policies aimed at bringing supply chains closer to the US and "re-shoring" domestic manufacturing jobs via spending bills like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Those measures will likely mean inflation sticks around and prompts the Fed to pause its easing cycle, Fink suggested. "Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we're not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting." The latest inflation reading for September showed the consumer price index grew 2.4% year over year, down slightly from 2.5% in August, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. After Fink's comments, another panel at the conference reaffirmed his forecast. When asked to raise their hand if they expected the Fed to cut interest rates twice more before the end of the year, the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and other Wall Street giants kept their hands down, according to CNBC. The central bank kicked off its easing cycle with a jumbo 50 basis point cut last month. This week will be important for the Fed's decision-making process, with a slew of data releases scheduled, including personal consumption expenditures, third-quarter GDP, and the October jobs report.

Title: Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained

Time Published: 2024-10-29T16:30:50Z

The Bitcoin price has surged past the $71,000 mark today. Over the past five days, Bitcoin’s price has rallied by more than 8.5%, climbing from $65,600 to as high as $71,118 on October 29. In the last 24 hours alone, the BTC price has increased by 3.8%. This upward momentum can be attributed to four key factors: The surge in Bitcoin’s price is closely linked to substantial inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday witnessed massive ETF flows totaling $479.4 million. BlackRock led the inflows with $315.2 million, followed by Fidelity at $44.1 million, Ark with $59.8 million, and Bitwise at $38.7 million. These significant investments coincided with Bitcoin’s price movement from $68,000 to over $71,000. Leading on-chain analyst James “Checkmate” Check highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin ETF inflows and CME Open Interest. He noted “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher, CME Open Interest is up, but not as much GBTC outflows are also minimal. We’re seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades.” The divergence suggests that investors are favoring direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs rather than engaging in cash and carry trades involving futures contracts. The carry trade strategy in the context of US spot Bitcoin ETFs and CME futures involves buying the ETF (tracking the spot price of Bitcoin) and simultaneously shorting Bitcoin futures on the CME. This approach aims to capitalize on price differences when futures trade at a premium to the spot price (contango). The notable shift toward ETFs indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, anticipating further price appreciation. Political developments are also influencing Bitcoin’s recent rally. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the impact of former President Donald Trump’s interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has gained over 32 million views and driven his Polymarket odds above 66%. Despite “crypto” being touted as the “Trump Trade,” Bitcoin’s correlation with Trump’s potential election victory seems to fuel the Bitcoin price rally. QCP Capital also noted that Bitcoin is up only 8% this “Uptober,” compared to an average of 21% in previous Octobers. They stated, “If spot holds at these levels, this October would mark Bitcoin’s fourth-worst performance in the past decade.” With total BTC perpetual futures open interest across exchanges standing at $27 billion—approaching this year’s peak—a breakout above $70,000 could trigger new all-time highs, especially with more leveraged longs joining in. Market data indicates a significant shorts squeeze contributing to Bitcoin’s price spike. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 65,622 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations across the entire crypto market amounting to $228.51 million. Of this, $169.47 million were short liquidations. Specifically for Bitcoin, $83.61 million in shorts were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, valued at $18 million. The substantial liquidation of short positions suggests that many traders were betting on a price decline and were forced to close their positions as the market moved against them. This mass unwinding of shorts can accelerate upward price movements as traders buy back into the market to cover their positions. Large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales,” are playing a pivotal role in the current rally. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet observed that Bitcoin’s rally continues, led by activity on the Binance exchange. He pointed out that Binance whales began significant involvement in the market two weeks ago during Asian trading hours, and recent declines in the Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) alongside price increases are “a clear sign of Binance whales’ intervention. Mignolet emphasized that this should not be interpreted as a decline in US demand, but an even stronger buying pressure from Binance. Over the past two weeks, demand for US Bitcoin spot ETFs has surged, with a net inflow of approximately 47,000 Bitcoin. Since most ETF products use Coinbase, movements in CPG data are closely tied to ETF demand. He concluded, “The current Bitcoin price is being driven by Binance whales, with sustained inflows of US capital.” At press time, BTC traded at $71,340.

Title: Don't Ignore Intel's Near-Term Value Prospects
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/10/29/dont-ignore-intels-near-term-value-prospects/

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary Intel (INTC, Financial) has recently been unfavorable among technology investors, primarily due to its poor results in the second quarter. Management has outlined a significant cost reduction plan in light of this, but past notions that it may leapfrog Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial)—also known as 'TSMC'—in manufacturing capability are no longer viable. Despite this, the stock is selling significantly cheaper than historically, and with Intel likely to deliver strong growth in FY25, I think this is a viable time to buy based on value. In the next 12 months, I see a market cap increase of approximately 50% as likely for the company. However, the longer-term returns seem less promising to me, given how the competitive market in chip design and manufacturing is developing. Operational analysis Firstly, readers need to place Intel’s recent 50% stock price decline into context. The company reported weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, falling short of the GAAP EPS consensus estimate by $0.27 and missing the revenue consensus estimate by $147.82 million. At the time of the report, management announced a $10 billion cost-reduction plan, including cutting 15,000 jobs and suspending dividend payments. This is likely to significantly improve its prospects in 2025, especially as the company exits its peak capital expenditure cycle. Nevertheless, amid these challenges, Qualcomm (QCOM) has suggested it may seek to buy segments of Intel. Currently, Intel is lagging behind its major competitors in data center and AI chips—AMD and NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial)—and is also failing to leapfrog TSMC in semiconductor manufacturing, which was its initial intention with its 18A advanced semiconductor manufacturing node. Now, TSMC has its market-leading 2nm N2 technology in the pipeline, with volume production expected in 2025. With all of this context in mind, it’s clear why Intel’s stock has been performing so poorly recently. However, there are positive developments that fortify the company’s position at its currently depressed valuation. For example, Apollo Global Management (APO) has proposed a $5 billion investment in Intel, signaling confidence in its turnaround strategy. Furthermore, this year’s challenges are likely temporary; my independent perspective is that 2025 will be a much stronger year for the company. While the 18A node may no longer be leapfrogging TSMC, it is expected to launch in 2025, helping Intel regain a competitive position in semiconductor manufacturing. The growth generated from 18A will be significantly supported by the company beginning to capitalize on its in-house manufacturing capabilities. Moreover, Intel’s IDM 2.0 initiative was implemented to enhance its foundry services. The company has heavily invested in fabs in the U.S., Europe, and Malaysia, including a $20 billion investment in two new fabs in Arizona. This is strengthening its global supply chain and increasing its manufacturing capacity. This explains why the company has had such a significant contraction in its free cash flow recently. While there have been challenges thus far in achieving a successful return on investment, as indicated in its second-quarter earnings report, I believe the company is still well-positioned based on a medium- to long-term horizon. Intel Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures Chart It’s worth reminding ourselves of management’s long-term strategy here, which reveals why the current depressed stock price could be a value opportunity. With an expansive internal foundry network, the company will have an increased capability to produce the majority of its products in-house. Furthermore, over time, it is likely to become a major provider of foundry services to external customers, including providing advanced process design kits for nodes like 18A. However, none of this changes that TSMC’s moat and market position are still unbeatable—the company currently holds over 60% of the market share in the global semiconductor foundry market. Its market share is therefore several times higher than that of its nearest competitor, Samsung Foundry, which has a market share of approximately 10 to 11%. Intel’s current position is negligible in comparison to these two players. Therefore, investors should not expect high alpha from Intel’s foundry services alone. Valuation and financial analysis Given the real constraints on Intel’s ability to produce lasting high growth in any of its major operating segments due to competition, I believe the value opportunity inherent in the low stock price is currently more appealing as a near-term allocation than a long-term one. The company has been particularly weak in profitability in the last few years, given the extensive operational investments it has been making to support its competitive positioning. Furthermore, its EV-to-revenue ratio has contracted less than its price-to-sales ratio over the past five years, suggesting that the company's net debt position has worsened relative to its market cap. That being said, there is enough total contraction on a revenue and book value basis to support a short-term investment. This is further supported by the fact that in 2025, I estimate the company’s year-over-year earnings growth could be over 300%, given its volume production plans with 18A, exit from its high-investment phase, and in-house manufacturing capabilities reducing costs. Intel Price Valuation Chart On a revenue basis—which I believe is more apt for this investment due to its recent instability in profitability—the company could achieve total revenues of $55.5 billion for full-year FY25, based on my analysis. If its P/S ratio expands to 2.75 over the next 12 months and the market prices these sales into the stock a couple of months early, the company could have a market cap of $152.6 billion. This indicates the potential for a market cap increase of 52% in a year from the current market cap of $100.31 billion. The company’s 10-year median P/S ratio is 2.94, and its 10-year revenue growth rate is 4.7%. Therefore, I believe an expansion to a P/S ratio of 2.75 is more than reasonable—even given the negative sentiment at the moment—considering my estimate of 6% revenue growth in FY25. This is further supported by the consensus that FY25 is likely to be a strong year for Intel on an earnings basis, as I mentioned above. While the market has a valid reason to be skeptical about Intel, I also find it highly unlikely that sentiment will not improve as the company's fundamental growth rates begin to expand. Looking longer term, and given the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, I don’t think we can expect 6% revenue growth to last. Certainly, 300% or more normalized earnings growth will be a one-off occurrence for FY25. Revenue growth is likely to taper for Intel after a successful ramp-up of its 18A node and the increased demand related to AI at the moment. Moreover, FY25 is likely to be strong because Intel’s upcoming products, such as the Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest chips, are set to leverage the 18A process node, offering improved performance for AI and high-demand applications. In FY26, I expect we could see revenue growth of 5.5% or lower, and in 2027 and beyond, I believe the company will likely achieve a revenue growth rate of approximately 5%. Given that competition from TSMC is so strong, the notion that Intel will be able to maintain a 7% or 8% revenue growth rate over multiple years seems unlikely to me, especially considering the current operational challenges the company has faced in streamlining and efficiency, impacting its profitability. Profitability When looking more closely at Intel’s prospects of generating stable profits, there are certainly concerns currently that ought to be understood when making an allocation. The company’s net margin has declined from over 25% in 2021 to just 1.8% in the recent trailing 12 months. Moreover, this is higher than its operating margin of 0.92% right now, likely a result of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. While the company’s current financial position is concerning, management has prepared for a robust 2025, reinforcing my near-term value thesis. For example, the company plans to deliver over 100 million AI PCs by the end of 2025. The company’s internal foundry model is also expected to deliver savings of $8-10 billion by the end of 2025—this involves Intel’s internal product groups operating in a foundry-style relationship with its manufacturing group. That being said, its foundry business is not expected to generate substantial revenue until 2027, with some revenue anticipated in 2026. This means that its foundry model won't lead to significant growth in the near term, but it is likely to aid in lowering the cost of production for its in-house chips, supporting my near-term value thesis. Intel is targeting significant margin expansion by 2030 through its foundry model and operational improvements, so long-term investors may be rewarded by buying the stock at its current depressed valuation. Currently, Intel looks a little stronger when analyzing it based on EBITDA rather than net or operating income. It currently has $10.08 billion in depreciation and amortization, taking its trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.036 billion to $11.116 billion in EBITDA—that puts its current EBITDA margin at 20.17%. With lower capital expenditures on the horizon after its new fabrication facilities are complete, these should bring down its cost of goods sold, supporting its free cash flow, net income, and EBITDA. That said, I reiterate that there is significant execution risk in this thesis, and if management fails to effectively bring its foundry model to market, I expect further hardship and compounding losses could occur over the long term. Risk analysis Between 2021 and 2025, Intel planned to achieve five processor nodes—Intel 7 and Intel 4 are already in use, Intel 3 is ready for high-volume manufacturing, and Intel 20A is set to debut with Arrow Lake processors, serving as a precursor to the more refined 18A node. Therefore, management is broadly on track, but any challenges in 2025 for full-scale production of 18A could significantly reduce the likelihood of my value thesis being successful. Compounding recent setbacks, Intel recently announced delays in the construction of two major chip-making factories in Germany and Poland, pushing back their completion by approximately two years due to lower-than-expected demand and financial challenges. Additionally, with the $10 billion cost-saving plan outlined in my operational analysis and the reduction of 15,000 positions in its workforce, the financial strain could lead to lower revenues, even if future profitability becomes more secure. Given the rapid advancements in the semiconductor industry led in manufacturing by the highly organized TSMC, any operational setbacks could further exacerbate Intel’s lag behind the leading semiconductor players. This also applies to chip design compared to market leaders AMD and NVIDIA. In the near term, operational failures, lower demand, and technology inadequacies could lead to Intel being a value trap. In the long term, significantly lagging behind its competitors seems a very real and likely outcome. Therefore, these risks should be taken seriously, and allocations should not be outsized, given the potential for future growth inhibitions. Conclusion I’m confident Intel is currently a strong value opportunity, given that FY25 is likely to be a strong year for the company. With my estimate of 6% revenue growth from the full-year 2024 consensus total revenue and my prediction of a moderate expansion in its P/S ratio, the company’s market cap could increase by approximately 50% in a year. However, looking longer term, I believe the competitive pressures from TSMC in manufacturing and AMD and NVIDIA in design will continue to be problematic. Therefore, this value thesis may work better in the near term than over five to 10 years, depending on management’s strategic decisions and execution. One Community. Many Voices.

Moreover, FY25 is likely to be strong because Intel’s upcoming products, such as the Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest chips, are set to leverage the 18A process node, offering improved performance for AI and high-demand applications. In FY26, I expect we could see revenue growth of 5.5% or lower, and in 2027 and beyond, I believe the company will likely achieve a revenue growth rate of approximately 5%. Given that competition from TSMC is so strong, the notion that Intel will be able to maintain a 7% or 8% revenue growth rate over multiple years seems unlikely to me, especially considering the current operational challenges the company has faced in streamlining and efficiency, impacting its profitability. Profitability When looking more closely at Intel’s prospects of generating stable profits, there are certainly concerns currently that ought to be understood when making an allocation. The company’s net margin has declined from over 25% in 2021 to just 1.8% in the recent trailing 12 months. Moreover, this is higher than its operating margin of 0.92% right now, likely a result of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. While the company’s current financial position is concerning, management has prepared for a robust 2025, reinforcing my near-term value thesis. For example, the company plans to deliver over 100 million AI PCs by the end of 2025. The company’s internal foundry model is also expected to deliver savings of $8-10 billion by the end of 2025—this involves Intel’s internal product groups operating in a foundry-style relationship with its manufacturing group. That being said, its foundry business is not expected to generate substantial revenue until 2027, with some revenue anticipated in 2026. This means that its foundry model won't lead to significant growth in the near term, but it is likely to aid in lowering the cost of production for its in-house chips, supporting my near-term value thesis. Intel is targeting significant margin expansion by 2030 through its foundry model and operational improvements, so long-term investors may be rewarded by buying the stock at its current depressed valuation. Currently, Intel looks a little stronger when analyzing it based on EBITDA rather than net or operating income. It currently has $10.08 billion in depreciation and amortization, taking its trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.036 billion to $11.116 billion in EBITDA—that puts its current EBITDA margin at 20.17%. With lower capital expenditures on the horizon after its new fabrication facilities are complete, these should bring down its cost of goods sold, supporting its free cash flow, net income, and EBITDA. That said, I reiterate that there is significant execution risk in this thesis, and if management fails to effectively bring its foundry model to market, I expect further hardship and compounding losses could occur over the long term. Risk analysis Between 2021 and 2025, Intel planned to achieve five processor nodes—Intel 7 and Intel 4 are already in use, Intel 3 is ready for high-volume manufacturing, and Intel 20A is set to debut with Arrow Lake processors, serving as a precursor to the more refined 18A node. Therefore, management is broadly on track, but any challenges in 2025 for full-scale production of 18A could significantly reduce the likelihood of my value thesis being successful. Compounding recent setbacks, Intel recently announced delays in the construction of two major chip-making factories in Germany and Poland, pushing back their completion by approximately two years due to lower-than-expected demand and financial challenges. Additionally, with the $10 billion cost-saving plan outlined in my operational analysis and the reduction of 15,000 positions in its workforce, the financial strain could lead to lower revenues, even if future profitability becomes more secure. Given the rapid advancements in the semiconductor industry led in manufacturing by the highly organized TSMC, any operational setbacks could further exacerbate Intel’s lag behind the leading semiconductor players. This also applies to chip design compared to market leaders AMD and NVIDIA. In the near term, operational failures, lower demand, and technology inadequacies could lead to Intel being a value trap. In the long term, significantly lagging behind its competitors seems a very real and likely outcome. Therefore, these risks should be taken seriously, and allocations should not be outsized, given the potential for future growth inhibitions. Conclusion I’m confident Intel is currently a strong value opportunity, given that FY25 is likely to be a strong year for the company. With my estimate of 6% revenue growth from the full-year 2024 consensus total revenue and my prediction of a moderate expansion in its P/S ratio, the company’s market cap could increase by approximately 50% in a year. However, looking longer term, I believe the competitive pressures from TSMC in manufacturing and AMD and NVIDIA in design will continue to be problematic. Therefore, this value thesis may work better in the near term than over five to 10 years, depending on management’s strategic decisions and execution. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: ‘Economic steel’: New Zealand’s Bitcoin opportunity, according to Michael Saylor

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor says the crypto currency presents an opportunity for New Zealand investors, and suggests domestic businesses should acquire it to boost their balance sheets. “It represents an extraordinary financial opportunity for people in New Zealand, and that’s kind of why I’m pleasantly surprised that you’re here,” MicroStrategy executive chairman Saylor told Markets with Madison in Washington DC. “The people that really need it [Bitcoin] are the global investors that are not in the major cities. “Because you can buy into the most scarce, desirable, global, digital property, and you’re getting the same investment proposition as a New York billionaire. “[New Zealanders] need it more. Trust fund babies in Manhattan don’t need it, they’ve got a lot of other [investment] options.” Saylor said investors like himself – who personally owned at least US$1.1 billion ($1.8b) worth of the crypto currency – were actively attempting to drive its price higher, meaning buyers of Bitcoin would stand to benefit. His Nasdaq-listed technology company was the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with more than 225,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet worth more than US$16b. Saylor suggested New Zealand businesses could follow his adoption playbook and acquire Bitcoin as a Treasury asset. “If you’ve got a company that’s a low-growth company, geared to the New Zealand economy, if you start to invest your balance sheet into Bitcoin, you are now with a 1% grower in New Zealand bolted on to a 50% high-growth, Big Tech, digital monetary network. “How many companies in New Zealand grow 20% a year for 10 years in a row? The odds are just about next to none. “But what are the odds of Bitcoin going up 20% a year? That’s actually my bear case.” Saylor expected Bitcoin to reach a price of US$13 million – it was currently about US$68,000. This year, financial institutions including BlackRock launched exchange-traded funds, offering investors exposure to the crypto currency through the stock market for a low fee. He believed Bitcoin’s next big moment – more listed companies or governments adopting Bitcoin – would be driven by banks accepting it as money in accounts or as collateral for loans. “Banking is just the next logical step,” Saylor suggested. “If you want to see all the people with the money and the power in the world embrace the asset, they will do it when their vendors support the asset. That’s a rippling thing.” Some Bitcoin investors were against Saylor’s suggestion banks should become more significant custodians of the asset because it would centralise a currency popular for its decentralised nature. In the interview he defended his position, arguing it increased the safety of the asset. “I think when the Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes, or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure. “When you have regulated, public entities like BlackRock and Fidelity and JP Morgan and State Street bank holding the asset, well, all the lawmakers and all the law enforcement arms, they’re invested in those entities. “So, there’s no way all the senators and all the congressmen are going to seize the assets ... because that’s where all their retirement money is.” Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network had no central power controlling it and no central point of technological failure. Speaking to the characteristics of the Bitcoin network and its invention by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Saylor said it achieved scarcity and had an “immaculate conception”. “Satoshi launches it, walks away forever, disclaims beneficial ownership – it’s an immaculate conception.” The initial Bitcoin mined by Nakamoto to secure the network had not been sold, Saylor said. Bitcoin’s supply was capped at 21 million tokens, meaning it had an expected deflation rate, unlike fiat currencies issued by central banks that targeted an annual rate of inflation. While many other crypto currencies had been launched, Saylor said Bitcoin was clearly the winner. “It’s because all the smart money in the world decided that’s the winner. Did it have to be? Well, no. “It’s like, why do we speak English? Because all the rich, powerful people decided on English. Could it have been a different language? It could have been French.” Explaining why he believed Bitcoin was a superior asset, Saylor said it was “clean money”, akin to “economic steel”, compared with dirty money such as sovereign debt, which had a negative real yield after tax. “It’s like forcible chemotherapy for your healthy 14-year-old teenager,” he said of sovereign debt. “That’s the scourge, the burden of humanity that they’ve been hauling for thousands of years. “When you ask, ‘What is human progress, what elevated the civilisation?’, it’s technology.” Saylor himself was once against Bitcoin, comparing it to online gambling in a 2013 post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Acknowledging it, Saylor said: “Everyone’s against Bitcoin before they’re for it.” “I’m sure the first guy with fire scared a bunch of other tribesmen. No one wants to get burned. Yet without fire, we’re not better than the apes.” When asked why he bothered being so publicly bullish on Bitcoin, Saylor said he wanted to “fix the money”. “If the money is broken, all eight billion people have toxic capital. All 300 million companies have toxic capital.” Watch part one and two of Michael Saylor discussing Bitcoin and his company MicroStrategy on Markets with Madison in the videos above.

In a highly controversial statement, Elon Musk estimated that artificial intelligence (AI) has a 10-20% chance of developing in an extremely negative direction (for the planet). The owner of X, the automaker Tesla, and the space company SpaceX is participating as a speaker at the 8th FII conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This statement carries additional weight coming from Musk, who is known for his investments in AI development and, until now, has defended its safety despite concerns about its future evolution. However, this is not the first time the billionaire entrepreneur has commented on the dangers of AI. According to Bloomberg, the conference includes executives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Citadel, with Musk invited via live streaming to discuss AI. “I believe that artificial intelligence poses a significant existential threat and something we need to be very cautious about,” Musk stressed. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Musk reaffirmed predictions he made months ago, warning that AI carries the risk of “wiping out” humanity. Nonetheless, he added a more optimistic note, suggesting there is now an 80-90% chance that AI’s development could yield positive outcomes. “I think it will be capable of doing anything a human can do, possibly within the next one to two years,” Musk told the conference. He also predicted that by 2040, around 10,000 humanoid robots might be in operation.

Title: Uber Bull Calls Grow Ahead of Earnings After Tesla's Robotaxi Event Underwhelmed

Uber Technologies (UBER) will report earnings for the third quarter before the opening bell on Thursday, with the ridesharing giant expected to report a substantial rise in profits and revenue from the same time last year. Uber is expected to report revenue just shy of $11 billion, nearly 20% above last year's $9.29 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Net Income is expected to roughly quadruple to $897.96 million, up from $221 million. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Uber stock, with all 27 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha rating it as a "buy," with an average price target of $91.12, about 14% above Tuesday's intraday price of $79.55. Several analysts reiterated their bullish stances on Uber following Tesla's (TSLA) robotaxi unveiling earlier this month, with lack of details on Tesla's plans leading Jefferies analysts to call the event a "best-case outcome" for Uber. Bank of America analysts said Uber's revenue growth in the quarter should be "aided" by new products and features like taxis and new partnerships for Uber Eats with Costco (COST). They also said the company appears confident features like autonomous vehicles (AVs) and increased availability of ride-reserving could boost revenue in 2025. Uber has announced a number of partnerships with AV companies like Waymo over the last several months, with the partnerships and Tesla's lackluster robotaxi event improving analyst outlooks on Uber. Bank of America analysts said they see "limited competitive threats" to Uber from Tesla's AVs in the near term, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered few specifics about how the company's AV ecosystem will work when they are eventually on the roads. Jefferies analysts said Uber could be "uniquely well-positioned" to grow its partnerships with AV companies, as Uber's ecosystem of users gives the companies a platform to rent their vehicles without building and managing their own rental service or app. Uber shares have gained close to 30% since the start of the year, though down from record levels reached in the days following Tesla's robotaxi event.

Title: Saudi wealth fund to cut overseas investments

By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Iain Withers and Anousha Sakoui RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund plans to cut its overseas investments by about a third, its governor told a conference in Riyadh on Tuesday, as the Kingdom taps into its resources to fund plans to wean the economy off oil. Speaking on a panel of business, technology and finance leaders, Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan said the sovereign wealth fund was more focused on the domestic economy and aiming to bring the fund's international investments down to between 18% and 20% of the total from 30%. Global business, technology and financial leaders have converged on the Saudi capital for the annual Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit, an opportunity for attendees to forge relations with some of Saudi Arabia's biggest companies and its $925 billion sovereign wealth fund. This year, the event may also test investor appetite in Saudi Arabia's economic transformation at a time when there are fears of widening conflict in the Middle East. The sovereign wealth fund is the main vehicle for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to steer the Saudi economy away from oil, with investments of hundreds of billions of dollars to develop new sectors and create more sustainable revenue streams. However, the fund has been scaling back some of its flagship "giga-projects" due to rising costs. Al-Rumayyan said there had been a shift in the way the fund deploys its investments towards establishing joint ventures with both international and local companies. "Now we see a shift from people who want us to invest or take our money to invest from there to co-investments," he told the conference. The country's investment minister, Khalid-al-Falih, said on Tuesday that the number of foreign companies with regional headquarters in Saudi Arabia had reached 540, ahead of a 2030 target of 500. An example of one will be Mizuho Bank, whose CEO Masahiko Kato said: "we will establish a regional headquarter in KAFD, in Riyadh." Oil remains the mainstay of the Saudi economy and Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told the same event that the country was committed to maintaining crude capacity at 12.3 million barrels per day. Other high-profile speakers on Tuesday included Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) President and CIO Ruth Porat, and the CEOs of several of the biggest banks including Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Artificial intelligence, the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the economic outlook were the main topics, and there was almost no mention of wars in the region on those panels. However, economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University gave a speech that was critical of the United States and Israel. "We don't need artificial intelligence in war, we need human intelligence to stop the wars," he said to applause. Sachs said Israel and the U.S. were blocking the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. "Until there is (a Palestinian state), there is going to be no peace in the region," he said speaking of wars in Gaza and Lebanon and concerns there may be a wider regional conflict. Elon Musk also joined the conference via videolink where he spoke about population decline, the need for "maximally truth seeking" artificial intelligence, and timing for sending space ships to Mars. He said he believed instead some AIs were being trained to be politically correct, with some being built with a "woke, nihilistic, in my opinion, philosophy." He estimated that by 2040, there could be billions of humanoid robots, priced between $20,000 to $25,000. That development could multiply the valuation of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), according to Musk. “Robotic taxis makes Tesla about a $5 trillion company," Musk said. "The Optimus Robot, I think, makes Tesla a $25 trillion company.” The Optimus robot is the humanoid robot under development by Tesla. U.S. ELECTION With just a week to go until America elects a new president, several panelists were asked who was more likely to win. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that markets expected Donald Trump to beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 but that the outcome remained "almost a coin toss". Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, who has endorsed Trump, initially said he wouldn't comment on the election before saying that Trump had a better understanding today of the how the presidency works than in 2016. There was also optimism about the global economy and among the bank CEOs about an increase in corporate dealmaking next year. Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley CEO, told another panel that the increase in activity would "be a global phenomenon", with bigger companies going public. Goldman boss David Solomon said he also expected more robust activity next year. Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) CEO Marc Rowan said a Trump victory would boost merger and acquisition activity that had been dampened by the current administration and lead to investment liberalisation. Several executives also voiced concern that inflation was more embedded globally than believed, even as central banks prepare to cut interest rates further. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said that the central bank policy "playbook" needed to be revisited because the transmission of higher rates to slow the economy had a greater lag as populations aged and due to changes in the housing market. "I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," he said.

Title: Behind the Scenes with FOX's NFL crew: How Tom Brady, team tell stories with graphics

By Richie ZyontzFOX NFL Lead Producer Editor's Note: Richie Zyontz has been an NFL producer for FOX since 1994 and is in his 23rd season as the lead producer. He has more than 40 years of experience covering the league and has produced seven Super Bowls. Throughout the 2024 NFL season, he is providing an inside look as FOX's new No. 1 NFL team, including NFL legend Tom Brady, makes its journey toward Super Bowl LIX. Read more behind-the-scenes stories from Richie Zyontz here. My first boss in sports television once described a football broadcast as consisting of three primary elements. He cited commentary from the announcers as the first category — painting a picture with words. Then came live coverage and replays — painting a picture with pictures. It was the third component that took me by surprise — painting a picture and telling a story with words and numbers plastered on the screen. [Related: More from Tom Brady | More from Richie Zyontz] It was the world of graphics, and for more than 40 years, it has been the career starting point for many successful producers, directors and executives. Once upon a time, graphics in a football game consisted of very little. Down and yardage, player names attached to rudimentary statistics, and the score only when going to commercial. By today’s standards, it was almost criminally uninformative. So, when CBS Sports began a program in 1981 to upgrade the graphics on all their events, I was fortunate to be among the first group hired. Although I’m not sure why. A love and pretty deep knowledge of sports, perhaps. But being a security guard in the CBS headquarters known as Blackrock hardly qualified me for this new adventure. The first graphics truck I worked in consisted of four people. There was the broadcast associate (me) in charge of the editorial, the technician operating the graphics machine, a statistician, and a person on a headset getting scores from other games. A cozy little group huddled in a rental trailer with three or four monitors to work with. And maybe a donut or two. Now the graphics unit numbers a dozen people, dozens of monitors, and takes up an entire truck. A broadcast graphics truck is a much busier place these days than it used to be. (Photo courtesy of Richie Zyontz) Needless to say, that third key component of a sports telecast described to me way back in 1981 has grown by leaps and bounds, changed forever when FOX entered the network picture in 1994. FOX wanted its graphics to be the industry leader, with an emphasis on making a unique visual difference to what we put on the screen. The most lasting and significant of those innovations was the Fox Box, which keeps the score on constantly and from which many other stats are triggered. Mocked at the time by other networks, it has now been copied by everyone, 30 years later. FOX LEADS THE WAY IN GRAPHICS, AND TOM BRADY IS ALL IN The explosion of graphics on your screen coincides with the explosion of information now available to us. Once upon a time, research consisted of poring through team press releases. Not anymore. We have half a dozen sources of information at our fingertips each week. Tom Brady jumps on weekly phone calls with NFL Next Gen Stats and Pro Football Focus, two outstanding sources of sophisticated data. At our first offseason meeting with Brady, he didn’t seem particularly interested in making statistics a big part of his broadcasting repertoire. That has now changed. He is clearly excited about the information available to him and enthusiastically discusses and dissects this analytic data every week. Now, certain stats have not been kind to our crew. Of the games we’ve covered, the visitors have won 7 of 8, outscoring the home team by a cumulative score of 251-154. Through 8 weeks of the NFL season, 67 games have been decided by 7 points or fewer. Our crew has only seen two of them. But there is a silver lining, especially for a new broadcaster just learning the ropes. BRADY KEEPS HIS ENERGY UP IN A BLOWOUT, WHILE SEAHAWKS FIGHT THEMSELVES Maintaining energy is crucial to anyone wearing a headset. That's easier said than done when the game proves to be less than competitive. There are Hall of Fame broadcasters who sound bored when calling bad games. As a viewer, that’s poisonous. Considering how our first eight games have played out, my money is on Brady avoiding such bad habits. On a typical rainy day in Seattle this past Sunday, we were treated to another one-sided game, as the Buffalo Bills and their electric quarterback Josh Allen dismantled the Seahawks, 31-10. The rain and wind were a huge part of the story, and played right into Tom’s wheelhouse of experience playing in bad weather. Rain and wind (and hair in his eyes) couldn't slow down Josh Allen against the Seahawks. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images) As the game got out of hand, Kevin Burkhardt and Tom had opportunities for some great anecdotal conversations. For instance, Brady took time to praise the Bills Mafia while telling a story about how that same fan base would hang him in effigy when he was with the Patriots. It was a fun story that might not have been told during a close, exciting contest. Not for a second did anyone’s energy waver. Not in our booth and not on the field, where our drenched camera people found some incredible shots. They captured Seattle teammates fighting on the field and then on the bench from multiple angles. Our cameras caught the Seahawks scuffling with each other during the game. There were also tight under the helmet shots, which have long been the signature of our fabulous camera crew. With the steady rain falling, those shots were even more dramatic. My favorite picture, courtesy of our low end zone cameraman Andy Mitchell, was an extreme closeup of a football just before the snap, wet on one half, dry on the other. Beautiful! ON TO LAMBEAU, THE NFL'S BEST GAME-DAY ENVIRONMENT So now we move on to Green Bay for an NFC battle between the Packers and the Detroit Lions. Lambeau Field is the best game-day environment in the NFL. As usual, our graphics crew will be loaded with interesting numbers. Hopefully, we get to cover a close game, but if not, there’s always a silver lining. Richie Zyontz has been an NFL producer for FOX since 1994 and is in his 23rd season as lead producer. He boasts more than 40 years of experience covering the NFL.

Title: Bitcoin Tops $71,000—A 5-Month High—As Election, Inflation Questions Swirl

Bitcoin just hit its priciest level since the spring as several market conditions, including next week’s U.S. presidential election, impact the $1.4 trillion cryptocurrency. Trump gives a keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in July. Bitcoin rose about 6% to as high as $73,544 at about 3 p.m. EDT, or 7 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time, Tuesday, the highest price for the token since March 14 (price movements in the 24/7 bitcoin market is most commonly measured in GMT). That moves bitcoin’s October gain to 13%, outstripping the leading American stock index S&P 500’s 1% advance this month. Other major digital assets rallied Tuesday, with ethereum up 4% to a 10-day high of $2.637, Binance coin up 2% to an eight-day high of $608 and Solana up 2% to a three-month high of $182. Also rallying were stocks of companies involved in bitcoin mining, the energy intensive process in which bitcoins are unlocked from the digital blockchain: Shares of Core Scientific, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms each gained Tuesday and are up at least 15% apiece in October. The bitcoin-led crypto rally is a confluence of several factors. Investors such as hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones have called on bitcoin as a hedge against inflation as the government and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump support policies that economists project will add trillions of dollars to the national debt. And with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates last month, skeptics believe monetary policy may be ill-equipped to correct inflation. Prices for the more conventional safe haven asset, gold, have also jumped, with gold up 6% since the Sept. 18 rate cut. The rise in bitcoin prices have also coincided with climbing betting market odds for a Trump victory, as the previous bitcoin skeptic Trump positions himself as the pro-bitcoin candidate, calling for a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” And there’s continued upward pressure from the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved by U.S. regulators in January, which attracted billions of dollars of inflows from institutional investors into the digital asset, according to Bernstein research. $66 billion. That’s how much bitcoin is held by the spot bitcoin ETFs operated by legacy asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity and more digital-focused players like Grayscale, or about 5% of the global bitcoin market. Bitcoin is by far the most valuable crypto token with an aggregate market value more than four times that of the next biggest digital asset, ethereum, which in turn is more than three times larger than the third largest crypto token, Binance coin, excluding the stablecoin Tether. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,750 in March, and is up more than 300% from its late 2022 nadir during the “crypto winter,” when a string of high-profile bankruptcies for one-time titans in the industry, including the exchange FTX, shook confidence.

Elon Musk isn’t just the richest person in the world, he’s also an investor in cryptocurrency. And the fact that Musk very publicly promotes crypto means a lot of people on social media don’t find it suspicious when they see videos of the billionaire promising to make them rich with some shady crypto investment. Deepfake videos of Musk hawking crypto are incredibly common on sites like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and X, leading people to lose obscene sums of money to scammers. And Gizmodo has obtained official complaints with the often shocking stories and we’re publishing them below. Gizmodo filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FTC to get complaints sent to the federal agency about crypto scams that pretend to be affiliated with Musk. We obtained 247 complaints, all filed between Feb. and Oct. of this year, and they’re filled with stories of people who believed they were watching ads for authentic crypto investments sanctioned by Musk on social media. The ads sometimes featured the names of Musk’s various companies, like SpaceX, Tesla, and X, while other times they utilized Musk’s association with neo-fascist presidential candidate Donald Trump. Musk, of course, endorsed Trump over the summer and has donated over $100 million to his own super PAC to get the former president re-elected. Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner filed a lawsuit Monday over Musk’s attempt to buy votes with his $1 million sweepstakes, but that’s an entirely different story Some people in the complaints believed they were talking directly with Musk, a sadly common story that has popped up in news reports before. But they weren’t talking with Musk, of course. They were communicating with scammers engaging in what’s called pig butcheringâthe name for a type of fraud popularized in the mid-2010s where scammers extract as much money as possible through flattery and promises of tremendous profits if the victim just “invests” where they’re told. There’s often a romance element to pig butchering, where the scammers pretend to be interested in a romantic relationship, but that was rare in the complaints Gizmodo obtained about Musk. More often than not, the marks are simply trying to make a quick buck and are sending money into completely fraudulent systems that make the victim think their money is sitting somewhere and growing. In reality, the public-facing portal is just smoke and mirrors with a number that changes at the whims of the scam artists. How much money did people lose? It’s actually kind of shocking when you read through the FTC complaints. People report losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a relatively short period of time. One person in Michigan who reported losing $700,000 to scammers explained they became suspicious “because I am not able to get information about the company, such as an address, email address or any other contact information except the phone number.” Another victim in Nevada who lost over $220,000 said they “saw a commercial featuring Elon Musk” that appeared “on either TikTok or Instagram” that was “asking people to join his AI trading platform.” The complaints have been redacted, striking them of any personal information, making it impossible for Gizmodo to track down the victims and verify their stories. But the sheer number of stories, and their similarities, make it worthwhile to look at even unverified claims to see what techniques scammers may be up to these days. While private information has been redacted by the FTC, there is useful information in the FOIA release that can help give context to where people are living and age ranges that help show who’s being victimized. Much like the scams we looked at on Truth Social earlier this month, most of the victims appear to be elderly. And that makes sense, if only because those people often have the most money to lose after a lifetime of saving. They’re also likely to have more access to their retirement accounts, though there is a complaint from one person in their 50s who lost over half a million dollars by draining their 401K, presumably prematurely. “This continued to happen until I depleted all my 401k that I had worked for 28 years to earn, leaving me with no nothing,” the complaint from North Carolina reads. “They continue to harass me asking me for more money saying that they have a plan to gain my money back.” There’s also the person in their 30s from Nevada who reported losing $32,000 while trying to find a YouTube video of Donald Trump doing a Fox News town hall. “I saw a video on YouTube supposedly about the Trump Town Hall with Hannity and this video of Elon Musk appeared talking about a crypto giveaway. Apparently it is a scam,” the complaint reads. The majority of the victims are from the U.S., and it’s natural that Americans would file complaints in their own country. But some of the complaints are from other parts of the world, including Canada and India. The thing they all have in common? The victims thought whatever they were investing in had Elon Musk’s seal of approval. Many of the scam website URLs have been redacted, but there are a handful that were still listed in the documents obtained by Gizmodo. One such website had been seized by the Kings County District Attorney in New York, according to the landing page, which we’ve captured below. Others were deleted entirely, but some, like elondonald.com, were still live at the time of this writing. Gizmodo is publishing some of the complaints below. Spelling and grammatical errors have been retained from the original. If you’ve been scammed on the internet and want to share your story you can email [email protected] In the end of June, 2023 I responded to Elon Musk’s day trading commercial on Instagram. I got a phone call from a person and started online trading with XT-BestSolutions. I’m dealing with one person [redacted] over the Viber phone services. He said he’s based in Barcelona, Spain. He guided me through the trading process daily on the XT-BestSolutions trading platform. He also guided me through the process of transferring my money from my US Huntington bank accountÂ through Crypto wallets to XT-BestSolutions trading platform. All transaction were made through different Sources to change US dollars to cryptocurrency. Starting on June 30, 2023 to current date, I transferred $700,000 to my XT-BestSolutions account. Through the process of online trading, XT-BestSolutions company credited me $200,000. Even though I still have more than $700,000 in my XT-BestSolutions trading platform account,Â I cannot withdraw any money back until I add $200,000 more to my XT-BestSolutions account to cover this additional credit, and after this (accordingly to what he saying) I will be able to withdraw all $900,000. Its become more suspicious to me because I am not able to get information about the company, such as an address, email address or any other contact information except the phone number and one person I communicating with. [redacted] My accountant has advised me to contact the FBI before I make anymore money transactions. [Redacted] was a victim of a crypto-currency investment scam by two scammers who identified themselves as [redacted] and Prof [redacted] in a WhatsApp chat group. He was instructed to download the WhatsApp after he click a link on Facebook that claimed to be Elon Musk looking forÂ people to invested in his AI business. The scammers instructed Henry to go on CSTT.co the online trading app and to udoBIT.com to complete several wire transfers. CSTT customer service and [redacted] instructed Henry to wire money to the Crypto.com and Cathay Bank. [redacted] completed 13 wire transfers that totaled to $618,000. Wire Transfers started on 11/29/23 through 01/03/24. [redacted] used the phone number [redacted] and Prof [redacted] used number [redacted]. I was online and saw the opportunity to invest in crypto funds, using AI algorithms and swing trading sponsored by Elon Musk in an effort to earn a few $100 a day.Â I was introduced to the Professor [redacted] and his assistant [redacted] who would be helping me in this.Â Originally, they furnished a trading account on the SILDGROUP platform with $100 to learn how to trade crypto currency with their guidance and instructions. Professor [redacted] was in charge of sending the trade signals and Assistant Sofia would explain how to trade and provide technical details. If I wanted to make more money, I was told I needed to have more in my account. I was encouraged to add more money if I wanted to reap higher profits, and in doing so I was earning more and more into my contract trading account.Â There were discussion group scenarios and we would meet at 4pm and 7pm EST each day to discuss financial scenarios going on in the US as well as in the crypto currency markets that would ultimately effect pricing. There were times of every few weeks that I would make a mistake and trade on the wrong coin, losing all the money that I had put in.Â I was given the impression that if I added money, they would help me make up what I had lost and gain more and more. This continued to happen until I depleted all my 401k that I had worked for 28 years to earn, leaving me with no nothing. They continue to harass me asking me for more money saying that they have a plan to gain my money back. We were scammed out of 233K over 4 months (From March 2024 to June 20, 2024) by organized criminal with online trading company called ICHCOIN.info leaded by: To trap investor with Elon Musk’s announcement of Quantum AI 4.0 on Facebook. Once clicked, new investor was invited to a WhatsApp school EIF Business School – Class session happened on every weekday, to teach about contract trading of crypto currency. Each student was credited $500 to trade with Quantum AI 4.0 signal when to trade and when to take profit. [redacted] and [redacted] acted as the Stock and Crypto analysis. [redacted] acted as the administrator and the Merchant acted as the customer service to match when there is wiring request from investors. They created different VIP groups to attract investors to wire money to join these VIP groups in order to get bigger benefit on each trading. They created fake crypto currency GMC, QPT and then MDV to lure investors. They force investors to borrow money from their school to buy crypto at Initial Coin Offer. when the investors sold those coins, they request to pay back that borrowed money in order to withdraw money. One I wired the money in, they won’t response to our requests and their website is no longer active. I saw a commercial featuring Elon Musk on either TikTok or Instagram asking people to join his AI trading platform. when I clicked on it I was added to a BlackRock AI smart contract trading ~79 WhatsApp group with over 200 members. I ignored it.Â I was then contacted about a week later via WhatsApp by a Lady with an accent named [redacted] at [redacted]: and she asked me to sign up atÂ https:www.globalcoinnexus.co So I started observing the text messages and one of the messages she sent was this : Warm reminder: Mr. Elon Musk has invited many professional analysts and trading experts from all over the world to participate in the Global Cryptocurrency Artificial Intelligence Trading Competition scheduled to be held in December. Steven Lee will represent BlackRocks London office in the Global Cryptocurrency Artificial Intelligence Trading Competition hosted by Elon Musk, and he needs more support and votes.

Rest assured, as long as you stay here every day and carefully read the content shared in the discussion group, your wealth will definitely increase tremendously On 10/22/2023, I started with an initial capital of 0.03493077 BTC which was about 1061 USDT, and started trading. A couple of days later, Steven Lee introduced a special trading group called VIP Trading Group. The VIP trading group requires a min of 30,000 usdt. Gloria kept pushing me to invest more money to join. I tried and lost all my money. He introduced another Advanced VIP which required min 50,000 usdt. I tried that also and lost money. I kept adding more usdt just to recoup my losses.Â In all, I cashed out all my stock investments, and crypto, borrowed money, and took loans on my home trying to recoup my losses. I was finally able to recoup my money but when I tried to withdraw the money. They will not let me. The website is saying to wait for verification. I have contacted Gloria and Steven Lee but nobody will pickup or reply to my text messages. The tech support ignores me. I converted all the usdt back to BTC but can’t withdraw it. I need help in getting my money back to pay my creditors. I stumbled into this Crypto Futures Trading Group I April, 2024. There was an ad on Facebook, purportedly funded by Elon Musk guaranteeing to pay crypto investors $100K if they try his trading training program and are not a millionaire within 6 months. I clicked the link which ended up assigning me to a trading group named after Professor Keller. I was very wary at first but everything seemed legitimate and maybe it was. The team was very professional, Prof Keller provide two lectures daily, about 2 hours each. The trading logic seemed valid. In the beginning, [redacted], the Assistant, required me to join the trading platform, LFEX which she said was licensed to operate in Montana, where I live. The real reason was that LFEX was the platform they made all group members join, supposedly so everyone was using the same Exchange, fees and currencies would be the same, etc. Only one group trade that I participated in, led by [redacted] or [redacted], failed to earn profits. On average, trades by [redacted] earned 35 to 45, sometimes over 100. Trades by Prof K averaged maybe 60, with trades over 100 and 200 common.Â Prof K kept saying he was not 100 accurate in his trades. As training and trading progressed, whale activities in the marketplace increased. I personally was zeroed or almost zeroed by whales many times while practicing my trading. Other group members were having similar problems. Over time, the group wanted to know how to protect against whales. Prof K devised a Joint Trading Plan for us, incorporating students from his other trading groups so that essentially l, we became a special whale, each with their own account, instead of asking us to send him money so he could trade for all of us. Prof K said that once the Joint Trading Plan started which was this week, that he could 100 guarantee that we would earn massive profits trading in lower priced currencies between $100 to $500. This week, the plan officially launched. I think it was on Tuesday or Wed. when instead of 1 trade per day, Prof K decided to do 3 trades in the same day, all in the NAF currency. I myself has about $215K in my trading account at the time. By the time trading ended, because I had taken on extra risk in tradingÂ risked and maximized Open and Close times, I had in total, earned over 1,200 interest on my trades, ending up with an account total of ov $8.5M in my trading account. Apparently, some disgruntled member of the day trading group who was not included in our night trading because they did not meet the minimum funds requirement of $50K, reported our group to LFEX. Initially when LFEX froze my funds, they said I had broken trading laws as well as participated in activities to create market disruptions and control one or more currencies. They did not cite specifically what laws or Exchange rules I had broken. Later, I looked up their TermsÂ Conditions and determined I had not broken any trading laws. The market disruption rule was vaguely listed and there is no list of penalty fees or actions that will be taken if infractions occur. I notified LFEX that everything U had done as a trader in training was I believed, legal and within trading norms for the marketplace. I asked them to release my funds. They said I must first pay a 3 penalty fee using funds that are not in my trading account within 15 days or they will confiscate all of the money in my trading account. That seemed like extortion to me, since I really did nothing wrong. Butchered Fat Pigs Scam. While Attempting to research the juniper tesla model y that is due to be released In twenty twenty five. A live recording of Elon Musk at the annual crypto convention in nashville in front of an audience was stating that crypto currency in the way of the future. And that’s tesla uses this innovation within their company. They said that they had live help and websites. All you had to do was scan the q.R.Code on the screen And it would take you to the official website. Where then if you transferred euthereum doge orbitcoin, whatever you sent within ten minutes, you would have doubled back. Now, i’m an intelligent woman, at least I consider myself that to be. I am a huge fan of elon musk and tesla. I only bit into this because it did sound too good to be true. Because it was elon mask, and he was on stage and it was live, and it looked like him and it sounded like him and all his words promoting this technology was so believable and everything that I believe in. However, after I transferred my Bitcoin, which it fluctuates from day to day, but say, maybe around 80,000 sometimes it’s a 100, you know, a 100,000 it fluctuates, I realized I was being scammed and I sent my money from my wallet. I don’t know who I mean, obviously I have an address and II screenshot it the whole thing, and I have the. Re. The YouTube video, which I realized for days they were posting live. I reported over 25 videos to YouTube to shut them down and they just kept popping up. I wanna Sue YouTube. A $100,000 is a lot of money or 80000 or whatever it was at that time, one point something of Bitcoin. And I know, I’ll probably never get my money back, but I need to get this message out there that AI believe it was AI because it looked and sounded just like and it was in front of a live audience, and now I’m thinking the audience was fake, I do. I did record the video and I do have like the wallet that I sent it to the timing. I was screenshotting everything. But if someone can get back to me, I went to the state police, they took my I’ve complained, but I’ve never heard from anyone they said an investigator would reach out to me that didn’t happen. I also filed a complaint with the federal bureau. Cybercrime, haven’t heard from them either. Please someone reach out to me click on a link from Facebook that had Elon Musk introducing his new AI system for crypto investments. The link took me to 2 groups on WHATSAPP. The group was named Howard Mars Investment Group. This group introduced me to AKBCOIN fake Platform. I ended up setting up my Crypto.com account and wired money from my personal account. I then transferred tether to the fake site. The site manipulated transactions to seem as if I was trading but actually was not. I ended up transferring $80k to the site and once the site showed I made funds it wouldn’t allow the withdrawal. Then the customer service said I had to pay a take on my winnings in order to retrieve my funds. Once I sent them the funds, they still did not release the funds from the site. The group disbanded and so did the site. www.h5.akbcoin. com I watched an ad on Facebook from Elon musk.

East German. They are running an elaborate crypto trading scam, using a fake trading site disguised as CTALL platform. CTALL has an ip address listed as China. They lure you in with a fake video featuring Elon Musk. Caroline convinces you to join and wire money to your trading account. Professor Andrea publishes his daily bullshit about the crypto market and elementary trading tips for review. He then provides fake trading signals for members to follow. The trades are not real so he can make them show high profits to keep you excited. All this time, they are relentless about telling you to increase your account funds for more profits. After you have deposited a few thousand dollars cash into your trading account, they manipulate the leverage on your order to 200. Within seconds, your entire account is wiped out. They steal your money, but then pressure you to wire additional funds, saying you can make up your losses! More lies. Be careful not to get involved with these criminals. Once your money is gone it is highly unlikely you’ll get any of it back That is what I found on line It really sucks to find out you have been scammed They have a group on WhatsApp I was crypto-scammed by a phishing scammer. I went to a website where Elon Musk was talking about the coming age of cryptocurrency. It all seemed super real. Elon said he was offering a promotion. Whatever a person sent in, he would match in return. Just to help cryptocurrency establish sooner. It looked like a great opportunity, so I sent a Bitcoin. I realize now it was foolish to do so. I know now I had been conned and played emotionally. Never again. So they got my life savings. They got me for $57,000. I can’t believe it. I think many, many others were victims also of the same scam. On 8/12/24 Monday evening I was looking for the Elon Musk – Donald Trump Interview. I was brought to the phishing website trumplive.org. There, Elon Musk was discussing Cryptocurrency and the financial world to come. Truth is, it was very inspiring and well done. Then Elon offered to speed along Crypto by offering on any crypto contributed he would personally match the amount. I realize now this was a scam. I also realize now this was an AI generated Elon Musk. Caught up in the moment I seized the opportunity and sent them my .966 Bitcoin. What scams do is to sell people false-hope. Then they take advantage of you. He claimed to be the real Elon Musk. I shared personal info and financial information with him. He wanted to connect with his fans and carry them along in his career. He helped me invest in cryptocurrency to improve my financial situation.Â From his instagram profile, [redacted], where he contacted me, we then chatted on telegram, username [redacted], and most recently using the WhatsApp [redacted]. He had me purchase bitcoin through apps like cashapp, Binance, Cex.io and through a bitcoin atm. They were all sent to the company wallet id. He did trades to increase my profits. Any time I doubted him he reassured me everything was fine and he even sent me his drivers license. Any pics like that he shared would disappear after I viewed them so I was not able to save or screenshot them. I have screenshots of our conversations. When I wanted to make withdrawals from my investment account with him he required more money for different fees. This has gone on for months. He had me sign a document to be on the Tesla board, and I have a pdf of that document. He deposited a fraudulent check for 9,000 into my bank account using a previous check I had received for some work I did with horses. I have lost over 50,000 with this individual and am concerned for my safety. I am still in touch with him and he does not know I am reporting this fraud. I have been scammed by another crypto individual online involving ethereum and lost over 30,000. Elon wanted to help me recoup from that as well as that case overlapped timeframes with this one. I invested in a Scam that Elon Musk started by buying crypto currency, by 1st buying it for 300$, but before you know it I had invested 39,000$ American dollars. My 1st investment was with Delta Stock.ai. We were in close contact for a month. I had a chance to buy ( HFTs) high financial trades.the 3rd pick that they had blinking, I lost 28,000$ and the broker I had told me and my Wife that we had to come up with another,8000$ or we would lose all our investment. He blamed me for the decision that I made but he had the stock blinking and so I picked that stock. I was just wondering if there was anything that you could Help me with. Thank you for your time, please send me back an email when we can talk. Thank you I saw a video on Youtube supposedly about the Trump Town Hall with Hannity and this video of Elon Musk appeared talking about a crypto giveaway. Apparently it is a scam. trumpelon.io I sent over $30K. I am reporting this for my grandmother [redacted]. She is 77yrs old. She got on tiktok, met some person claiming to be Elon musk, convincedÂ her to start doing cryptoÂ to get some type of wallet. After that multiple people started scamming her. From tik tok, wassup app, eBay Cash app ect. She has loaded gift cards vanilla, apple, eBay. Sent money through cash app. She has gotten her socially security number stolen it’s all over the internet. She has gotten her social security check stolen. I really need help to stop these people from stealing her money she thinks all of this is real and it’s not. Please help my grandma,Â ban her from social media if you can. All her information for her scams are on her phone. Started with an ad on Instagram about investment learning that led me to join a WhatsApp group. A guru named [redacted] Vyas was guiding along with help his best student (b)(6) and assistant [redacted]). [redacted] usually provided daily inputs on stock market while [redacted] used to train people interested in Crypto and both also provided trading signals which were remarkably accurate. I only observed the guidance and signals for several weeks and realised that while stocks guidance was great the crypto profits were amazing. People were making 50 or 100 percent profits or more with each trade. I had no idea about crypto so I was initially wary of it but eventually got drawn to it. The group also eventually transformed to a crypto focussed group as more people felt the same way. This is where number of new people opened accounts in a trading app called CGL BMG on the insistence of [redacted]. [redacted] also provided information indicating how CGL BMG is reliable as it has an MSB License etc. All of this looked like a scam but a small deposit of around 200 dollars initially would limit the risk. I further went on to try withdrawal which seemed too slow but worked the first time. This brought in more trust towards the platform and my profits kept growing with some initial hiccups and increasing investment. This is also where it was understood within the group that [redacted] who is quite knowledgeable in investing and has such great accuracy using an AI based trading is actually doing some research and has partnerships with organisation’s like Elon Musk’s xAI. Of course not verified by me. This is also why crypto trading strategies kept changing each week and required higher investment for each new trading experiment. The last experiment called the Whale plan hadÂ several investment groups based on the amount of funds in USDT based on a minimum of 20k, 80k, 150k and so on. Higher profits for the higher investment slabs. I was at about 38k with my investment and profits and Aditi asked me to fund it up to 50k after which she would help me trade up to 80k so I could enjoy more profits. Now this was already difficult for me to go upto 50k as these are huge funds for me but I did and she helped me go up to a whopping 129k with a few trades. However now she suggested I add the remaining to go upto the 150k investment group instead of the 80k group. This made me strongly suspicious again and despite declining she insisted I should find a way to get there. I instead attempted to make a withdrawal of 4k, from my current total fundsÂ which are over 125k, to my Binance wallet where I had withdrawn before,but after 4 days past the withdrawal was failed. The reason was after lot of inquiry given as an anomaly in my withdrawal address which resulted in blocking the withdrawal function on my account. I was told to deposit 30 of the total funds in my account around USD 38051 to unfreeze the withdrawal mechanism. It is quite impossible for me to do this and I am now sure this is nothing but an attempt to squeeze more money out. I am helpless after investing most of my savings into this scam. Please help. I was watching a SpaceX rocket launch on YouTube with a friend.Â Elon Musk came out on the stage and began speaking to a crowd of people and said something to the effect of to celebrate today’s historic launch and to encourage the growth of crypto adoption, scan this QR code and send BTC or ETH or USDT (perhaps others but I don’t recall) to the wallet.Â We will reimburse you 2:1 any amount you send. Without checking to see if this was a scam I logged into my Kraken wallet and sent 6.5 ETH to the address.Â Almost instantaneously I realized this was fraud but could not stop the transaction. I listened to prominent individuals’ advice ( Justin Trudeau, Elon Musk etc) on line about investing in crypto currencies and I decided to invest. I was told by Maria Diaz, (who claimed that she was assigned as my accounts manager, after I refused to invest initially), that I would have a weekly income from my investment. I was given an account on line where where I was allowed to track my investment. The returns were exceptionally good, so after a while I decided that I should start retrieving income. I was then told by the aforementioned Maria Diaz that I could not. When I reminded her about our conversation about the weekly income she cut me off and closed the page on the internet. I have since been unable to get to them, as they don’t answer the phone. They have subsequently been calling me ( his name is [redacted]) from Taura Capital to help me get back my investment, but I have to send them more money to pay some fees to the person at their Accounts Dept. to do the job. I am still getting these phone calls coming in almost everyday. I clicked on an Instagram ad featuring Elon Musk discussing AI in crypto options trading. Shortly after, I was contacted by an [redacted] who introduced me to Professor [redacted] via WhatsApp. Since then, I obtained what appears to be a fake New York State driver’s license for Parker, listing the address as 143 West 57th Street, which is actually the Park Hyatt New York at 153 West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019. I deposited funds to a crypto address [redacted], which later changed to [redacted], and I suspect it will continue to change. When I tried to transfer the money back, [redacted] stopped this, claiming the only way to retrieve my funds was by joining a VIP group with a minimum investment of $50,000. I refused to do this, so I traded in the account and grew the funds to USDT 115,415.82. However, when I attempted to transfer the funds out, I was blocked again and told I couldn’t access the profits without making the additional investment, confirming my suspicions. These people need to be stopped to prevent more individuals from being scammed in the future. Here is the last part of today’s conversation 7/3/24, 18:19:51 [redacted]: You have till FridayÂ to do so then its FBI time 7/3/24, 18:21:28 [redacted]: This is my rule. I am not afraid of the FBI.

I waited for 2 weeks and then saw the real Elon Musk with woads of cash in his hands from the mining platform on my iphone! I didnt understand where it was streaming from! so I contacted the website because I thought Elon Musk has approved of it! That was the only reason!!! so I invested $18000. I meant to only invest $2000 and then cash out and see if it was possible! But their pressure sell tactics over came me! They use paypal and Zell, Venmo, try to open account on ,started cash app s andÂ connected to my Bank, down loaded all crypto wallets , and block chaines to withdraw theÂ money from ! it took 2 months all together! It took over 8 -10 hours a day to be able to withdraw money from my accounts due to security measures I had placed on my accounts! They are so smooth and sophisticated thatÂ make you open your cash app accounts in front of them and follow their instructions to withdraw money money from you accounts and send it to these unknown people the miners .Â Everytime I said I don’t to invest anymore he would say Ok! you can start withdrawingÂ anytime !Â When you sign up there are 2 sites you deal with! one is the platform and the other one is you account platform. where you get a login! and once you go in you will see the amount invested and several other boxes that show how much you have made real time,also there is a chat boxÂ that answers any needs or questions. everyone has to have an account manager who leads you in how to to invest! In my case Elon Musk!!!Â When it came to withdrawing, I was told by the accounts website chat that I need to pay $15000.00 for cash out of $170000.00! when I asked what are the charges pertaining to, they said its the IRS rulesÂ that they are collecting for the IRS! I did a search the company is a UK company ! I reported to my account manager and told him this doesn’tÂ sound right! and blocked him! another week went by and the account websiteÂ emailed me and said that the IRS fee was paid by my account manager and to call him to start cashing out! eager that I was to get my own money back I contacted him on whats app and he said ok and lets cash out! I gave filled out a form onÂ the website that seemed like a regular wire form from my bank and gave them the account number to wire the money to. everything was going great until they toldÂ me you need a pin number in order to receive the money in you bank! and for me that fee was $1500. Un willing to pay a dime I declined and blocked my manager again. Later on he tried on Instagram to reach me but I blocked him there to!Â I am reporting this to letÂ you know how sophisticated these people are.Â There are lots and lots of impersonators of Elon Musk out there specially on social media X and IG forÂ sure and for people like me the victims!Â I am 60 years old and know about technology enough to follow them and I could tell how smart they are! they truly are! on Facebook, I found an ad that supposedly Elon musk and his team created quantum AI and if you join the investment club youll make money. This AI created Elon Musk even stated that if he didnt make $1 million and six months he would give you a Tesla, so I followed the link and signed up with a company called Frank Barbara, crypto trade chamber. I watched i the trading for two or three weeks before I started sending money to my crypto wallet, and then sent from the crypto wallet to the trading platform called vencoinss.com. I sent them $10,000 to their bank account in California and started trading and they sent me the $10,000 back as I was making so-called profits. I felt confident that this was OK so I sent $17,000 in USD to the trading account. I built the account up to $64,000 with my 17,000 and the rest fake profit. Then I was about to send them more money when a trade happened that I lost $69,000 that wiped out my account and I knew it was a scam because the trade was with MSH crypto which is worth less than a dollar and I lost 69,001 trade using $6500 in funds for the trade I have documentation on WhatsApp of all my trades and the so-called administrator. My name is [redacted] and my phone number is [redacted], my email address is [redacted] , I want to see this so-called company put out a business so nobody else loses any money. Elon Musk and I have been communicating through text messaging since June 2023.Â He first got me talked into investing Apple Gift Cards in the amount of $500 each.Â His promise was to pay me half of the investment accumulating interest at Crypto Currency Account in BTHÂ ETH and a new Tesla car.Â The rest was supposed to help pay for our wedding.Â At first I thought it was an imposter.Â But latter Elon sent me voice messages, several oaths of loving me and I have talked with Elon on the phone several times.Â Just to verify it was really him.Â Before I reported anything I was in wonder whether anyone would beleive me.Â But after Elon got his Billion Dollar Package deal, his demeanor changed towards me.Â He got all my SSDI check this past June and has left me owing for my July rent and withdrew all the money on his Birthday the 28th.Â Valued at over $700,000.00.Â Without wire transfering it to my account.Â He also used my ID.me account verification access codes.Â To verify my Identity and created that Cryptocurrency account using my name.Â I have screenshots on the balancees.Â To show we conversed alot and would talk for hours about our building our money up so we would have a good future together.Â Now last I seen on Facebook…hes in Dubai with some young girl.Â And Im scared Im going to end up homeless without his helps.Â I dont know what to do about it. UPDATE 07/18/2024 Consumer is calling to report that she is receiving death threats from someone. Consumer reported that she is being stalked by his girlfriend. Consumer is referred to the local police department. I answered an ad saying that they use Elon Musk AI trading recommendations. Its run by two people [redacted] and [redacted]. Its on a what’s app chat room. I deposited first a $1,000. into the ECOS account and made some money using Patrick’s recommendations. By the way the profits were over 50 almost all of the time, that was the first red flag. So [redacted] talked me into putting another $8,000 into my account so i could join the 10X Bull Market Multiplier. So with the first deposit and second one i had $9000. and the profits of $1000 i had enough to join the 10X program. [redacted] said the 10X program would return 10 times my money. The only thing was i couldn’t take any of the profits out until the program was over on February 15th plus i had to give them 10 fee and the profits couldn’t be used to pay them. This was my second red flag. I figured the profits everyone was making was about as real as the dinosaurs on Jurassic Park. I then told [redacted] I didn’t want to be in the 10X program and she removed me. At this point i wanted my money back, so i started a withdrawal from my ECOS account on 2/8/2024 in the amount of $10,785 and haven’t received it yet. The money was sent by Crypto.com to ECOS in the crypto funds of USDT. Please see that there people who have about 800 people investing with them.

Title: "Tackling Obesity": NHS & Eli Lilly Announce Mounjaro Clinical Trial in UK - The HighWire

Updated 5:19 AM EDT, Tue October 29, 2024 By Tracy Beanz & Michelle Edwards Obesity is not just an epidemic in the United States. It torments those living in Great Britain, too, where the most obese patients cost the National Health Service (NHS), one of the nation’s most praiseworthy institutions, an average of $2,416 a year. The health impact of obesity in Britain is significant—it is the second largest preventable cause of cancer and costs the NHS roughly $14 billion a year. Speaking up about the growing problem, British Member of Parliament (MP) and Health Secretary Wes Streeting recently stated that “widening waistbands” burdened the NHS. But, eureka, Streeting has found a “game-changing” solution. Without question, obesity wrecks one’s health, so what is Streeting’s scheme? Lo and behold, under Streeting’s lead, NHS has partnered with Lilly—the world’s largest pharmaceutical company—in a $360 million investment deal from the drug manufacturing giant to perform real-world trials of its star obesity jab Mounjaro on the unemployed. Streeting, who also serves as a Vice President of the Local Government Association and patron of LGBT+ Labour, pleaded his case in The Telegraph on October 14, 2024. Noting that “as a country, we’re eating more, eating less healthily, and exercising less.” A month before that, citing long waits for treatment, crumbling hospitals, mental health patients in “vermin-infested cells,” and far fewer MRI scanners than comparable countries, a recent government-commissioned report declared the 75-year-old NHS is in “critical condition.” With Britain’s new prime minister Keir Starmer insisting the NHS has reached a critical “reform or die” position, Streeting wrote in The Telegraph: “Our widening waistbands are also placing significant burden on our health service, costing the NHS £11 billion a year—even more than smoking. And it’s holding back our economy. Illness caused by obesity causes people to take an extra four sick days a year on average, while many others are forced out of work altogether. For years, governments have ducked the serious, long-term policy decisions required to tackle its debilitating effects. Fears of being labeled “nanny state” have meant nothing has been done, and the problem has only gotten worse. As with most of the issues we inherited, this Government recognises that we can only do so much. It will require working in partnership with business, civil society, and all of us as citizens to make real progress – that’s what Sir Keir Starmer’s mission-driven Government is about.” What is the “mission-driven” Government described by newly anointed British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the democratic socialist’s Labour Party? And what does “reform or die” ultimately look like? In mid-October, in what is surely a deep-state dream come true, Starmer teamed up with King Charles, Elton John, and a Michelin chef to “woo” the world’s most powerful bosses—the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, along with the heads of Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays and Brookfield—to secure roughly $82 billion in foreign investment pledges. Prior to Starmer’s star-studded evening, in September, The Telegraph wrote that Starmer was preparing a raft of “nanny state” interventions on public health as he “races to save the NHS from collapse.” Indeed, the UK’s healthcare system, which provides universal health coverage to UK residents and non-residents with a European Health Insurance Card, faces numerous challenges. Funded by general taxation, the NHS is typically known for providing a high standard of care, yet it is currently “flashing red” on nearly all performance measures. Hmm, it seems like the millions from Lilly, along with the billions it is seeking from the likes of BlackRock and others, will certainly help to facilitate “reform.” Dr. Phil Banfield, chairman of the council at the British Medical Association, depicts a dreadful state of affairs at the NHS, remarking that the “crisis is now and the crunch is today,” adding, “investing in medical schools while refusing to reverse years of pay erosion is illogical.” Banfield explained that the NHS is not where it is today due to the pandemic or new economic challenges precipitated by war in Europe; instead, he insists, “we’ve been warned of catastrophe for 10 years, it’s now arrived.” According to Banfield, “this devastation has been wrought by successive UK governments.” Presently, short on clinicians, the NHS has published the first ever Long Term Workforce Plan, backed by over USD 3.1 billion in Government funding to deliver “the biggest training expansion in NHS history alongside measures to improve culture, leadership, and well-being.” Apparently, controversial and dangerous weight loss jabs like Mounjaro are part of the plan to achieve well-being. “We are calling on some of the world’s leading scientific minds and research institutions to help us succeed,” Streeting proclaimed when announcing the significant investment from Lilly to shape up Britain’s healthcare predicament. He added that the five-year real-world study Lilly will operate with its weight loss jabs could be monumental in Britain’s approach to tackling obesity, which will, in turn, help people get back to work and ease the toll obesity takes on the NHS. Specifically, the study will examine the “real-world” effectiveness of tirzepatide (Mounjaro) on weight loss, and on preventing diabetes and obesity-related complications. Researchers will also measure how the drug affects a patient’s employment status and the number of sick days they take. To get Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro weight-loss program underway, the NHS, which is also “tackling obesity” with efforts like the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, has proposed that those who need it most should get it first. Britain hopes to give the jabs to 250,000 NHS patients over the next three years. Mounjaro was approved for use in the UK last year. Still, Lilly held off on its launch until its pre-filled injection device called Kwikpen was endorsed by the country’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The product has been cleared for both type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. In yet another example of Big Pharma profiting from the destruction of public health, Lilly reported worldwide sales of Mounjaro, approved by the FDA in 2022, at $5.2 billion in 2023. Analysts project its sales will rise sharply through the rest of the decade, with sales expected to reach a staggering $34 billion by 2029. But common sense must prevail. Big Pharma isn’t the solution to fix any healthcare crisis and quite literally has no desire to be. Unsafe weight loss jabs like Mounjaro must not become the overarching anecdote to the obesity crisis that has taken hold of both Britain and the United States. Having said that, it will be interesting to see how this move, which feels eerily similar to a social credit score, plays out in Britain. Noting that the “eligible population” for the Lilly obesity study is actually in the millions, Dr. Dolly van Tulleken, obesity policy specialist at the University of Cambridge, remarked: “[There are] some serious ethical, financial and efficacy considerations with such an approach … Such as looking at people, or measuring people based on their potential economic value, rather than primarily based on their needs and their health needs. It’s incredibly important that people in the UK access healthcare based on their health need rather than their potential economic value.” Tracy Beanz is an investigative journalist with a focus on corruption.

Title: These 3 Energy Closed-End Funds Are Still On Sale
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/29/these-3-energy-closed-end-funds-are-still-on-sale/

Oil pumps and graph If you’re as bullish on oil as I am, let’s look past vanilla bean favorites like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Great companies but a bit pricey, as they only yield 3% to 4%. We’re better off with diversified energy funds that dish dividends up to 9%. Now we’re talking! The conditions are right for another push ahead in energy’s crash-‘n’-rally cycle. The Middle East (‘nuff said). The Federal Reserve careening towards a “no landing” scenario. And the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) joining the global money printing party. It could be high time for Texas tea’s next leg higher. To celebrate, let’s review three closed-end funds (CEFs) that yield 7% to 9% and trade at discounts up to 11%. The BlackRock Energy & Resources Trust (BGR) owns energy equities—integrated energy majors, exploration and production (E&P) firms, distribution companies and more. It’s diversified from a geographic standpoint; 70% of the fund is invested in American firms such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP), while the remaining 30% is dedicated to international energy stocks including the U.K.’s Shell (SHEL) and France’s TotalEnergies (TTE). The tight portfolio of fewer than 30 holdings isn’t surprising for an actively managed fund, but BGR is really top-heavy, with Exxon accounting for more than 20% of assets (yikes!) and Shell another 10% or so. Also, while many CEFs are happy to use debt to crank up their exposure, BGR doesn’t use a cent of leverage. But this BlackRock fund does have a few familiar CEF traits. It pays monthly distributions, which we won’t find in basic sector ETFs. It also trades at a nice 11% discount to its net asset value (NAV), which is a slightly deeper bargain than its ~10% five-year average discount. Most importantly, BGR trades options. Specifically, management uses a covered call strategy, which is how it manages to squeeze a 7% yield out of the same companies that fund the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLE) 3%-plus yield without debt leverage. Is it a better way to invest in energy? BGR’s primary quality is guarding against downside (thanks to the covered calls), but even then, it hasn’t delivered much protection during really precipitous drops. In the meantime, we enjoy oh so much less of the upside. Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO) is another largely straightforward energy-sector CEF, though it’s far more established. This fund came to life in 1929, meaning it’s all of about five years away from celebrating its centennial. It also has a storied distribution history, paying its shareholders for more than 80 years (and yielding 9.1% today!). PEO has a wider portfolio than BGR, at just less than 60 holdings, and it’s chock full of energy blue chips such as Exxon, Chevron, Schlumberger (SLB) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC). Oddly, though, it also has substantial (14%) exposure to chemicals firms like Linde (LIN), and a peppering of other industries, such as metals, mining, containers/packaging and construction materials. But it’s arguably more buttoned up than the BlackRock fund. It does utilize leverage, but a trace amount of it (sub-1%). Nor does it trade options. The result is nothing to scream about, but PEO does offer occasional bursts of outperformance. PEO Outperforms, Sometimes The 11% discount to NAV is a little misleading, too. We’re buying its assets on sale, sure, but we can do better—PEO’s average discount over the past five years is above 14%. Of course, most of us know if we really want income out of the energy space, we need to forget plain-Jane integrated majors and E&P firms, and instead look toward the infrastructure providers. Specifically, master limited partnerships (MLPs). The bulk of CEFs investing in the energy space are concentrated in MLPs. Among the most interesting is ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO), which is happy to own midstream firms (read: pipelines, storage, terminals, etc.) in partnership and corporation form. But its portfolio is thick in MLPs, including top 10 holdings such as Energy Transfer LP (ET), MPLX LP (MPLX) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). EMO gives us plenty to digest here. The fund does what CEFs tend to do—despite a modest 6% in leverage, EMO acts like a more exaggerated version of an index fund, booming when basic MLP ETFs are up, and languishing when they’re down. As a result of its run since 2020, EMO isn’t all that cheap. Yes, its assets are trading at 90 cents on the dollar. But we can do better—it has traded at an average discount of 16% over the past five years, including a stint near that average earlier in 2024. It’s also more than meets the eye. EMO actually merged with two funds—ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund, and ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Total Return Fund—in early September, and a couple weeks later, the company announced that Chris Eades would step down from the portfolio management team effective as of the end of 2024. And snuck into the middle of all that? An upgrade to monthly dividends. Want an example of just how disrespected CEFs are? If we go to just about any data provider, they’ll tell us that EMO yields around 3% right now. But it doesn’t! More than a month removed from a change to the fund’s dividend policy, and they’re still calculating the new 33-cent payout on a quarterly basis (3%) rather than monthly (9%). The monthly dividend is certainly more aligned with investors’ interest, but we have to be careful here. Even plain-vanilla index funds like the InfraCap MLP ETF (AMZA) deal with dividend declines; unlike traditional companies that will maintain a specific dividend level, MLPs’ distributions tend to shift with their profits. With EMO, that dynamic is exaggerated, leaving us with larger fluctuations in payouts over time. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Your Mag 7 Earnings Guide
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/your-mag-7-earnings-guide/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T13:56:43Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted October 29, 2024 Short sellers took a beating last week following Tesla’s post-earnings romp that shot the stock higher by more than 25%. TSLA posted its best trading day in over a decade when management announced it topped Q3 profit estimates and improved automotive gross margins. Just two days later, the shorts banked losses of $4.2 billion closing out bets against the stock during its historic rally, according to data from S3 Partners. Not bad for a company so many investors love to hate… It’s no secret Tesla is a company that evokes strong emotions from just about everybody. Whether we’re talking about Elon Musk’s politics or online trolling, the latest Cybertruck recalls, or dwindling demand throughout the EV space, even casual investors held negative opinions on Tesla following its ugly first-half performance. Tesla shares were driven into the ground despite a roaring bull market for mega-cap tech earlier this year. And even as the stock began to show signs of bottoming out over the summer, most investors continued to expect the worst. I started getting bulled up on TSLA in late June as the beaten-down stock approached a potential breakout at $200. My reasoning was simple: The stock chart was quickly improving, posting a positive reaction to mediocre earnings back in April. Meanwhile, the bearish arguments were getting louder. Well, that $200 breakout lit the fuse for a quick 30% rally in July. And after a hard reset, shares were once again perking up as the fourth quarter began. Following last week’s earnings beat, the stock is now green on the year and threatening to run to $300… and beyond. Why does any of this matter? Because TSLA’s earnings rally was a potential preview of what’s coming when more of the Mag 7 mega-caps report this week. Earnings are unavoidable for anyone with a trading timeframe longer than a couple of months. But momentum and swing traders can mostly avoid earnings surprises if they so choose. That’s usually my style: selling (or partially selling) open swing trades ahead of earnings announcements, and making a point to avoid jumping into a new play directly in front of an earnings release. But I do keep a close watch on earnings, specifically how the Street reacts to the numbers. If TSLA is any indication, we could be in for more than a few powerful post-earnings rallies this week as many of the biggest names report. Here’s what you should expect… Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)Market cap: $2.06 trillion Reports Tuesday (Oct 29) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.84 per shareRevenue – $86.39B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.95 per share Actual: $2.94 per share Revenue – Consensus: 64.38B Actual: $68.71B Google (I refuse to call this company Alphabet) missed its annual earnings estimates for the 2022 fiscal year. But revenue remained on track. The company is back in the habit of beating earnings regularly, crushing April’s estimates by 25%. Turning to the chart, we have a lovely setup for a post-earnings rally should the numbers impress investors: GOOG is up more than 90% since the Nov. 2022 bottom, yet it’s approximately 15% off its all-time highs logged on July 10. The stock decisively cleared its 2021 peak in April, breaking into new all-time highs.

And despite a maximum drop of approximately 30% during its most recent drawdown, the stock continues to power higher off each and every one of those lows. AAPL shares are coiled tightly just below all-time highs.

But it’s back on track and exceeding quarterly projections. Everyone on Wall Street is expecting a strong performance. If MSFT’s performance off its 2022 lows is any indication, we should see a continuation higher: MSFT has more than doubled since Nov. 2022. But the stock has essentially moved sideways for the past eight months. It’s now about 10% off its all-time high set back in July.

The company had just changed its name from Facebook to Meta and was feeling the heat, falling short of earnings estimates as the stock sunk into the abyss. But Meta has miraculously gone from worst to first since bottoming out in late 2022. Now, it’s back on track delivering beats since Q1 of last year. Just look at that comeback rally: Say what you like about Zuck and his metaverse plans – META is up 545% off its 2022 lows. Today it sits just about 5% off its all-time highs posted earlier this month. The stock just completed a 5-month consolidation on its way to new all-time highs, making it the strongest chart of the Mag 7s heading into earnings. A solid beat could keep the party going to $600 and beyond… Amazon (AMZN) Market cap: $1.99 trillionReports Thursday (Oct. 31) Halloween Night Estimates:Earnings – $1.14 per shareRevenue – $157.26 B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.70 per share Actual: $2.90 per share Revenue – Consensus: $570.87B Actual: $574.78B Here’s the thing about AMZN: those boxes will keep showing up on your doorstep, no matter what. But the company hasn’t exactly set the world on fire lately. Revenue fell short in 2021 and earnings missed in 2022, yet it steadily beats estimates since the start of 2023. Is there a bigger comeback in the works? Let’s check the chart: If you had to pick a dog to run with TSLA, it has to be AMZN. While we’ve witnessed a strong comeback from its 2022 lows, the stock has yet to post a significant rally above its 2021 peak. If AMZN can impress investors this week, could we finally see a bigger breakout? It’s possible! This is a great chart from a risk/reward standpoint.

By Greg Guenthner Posted October 29, 2024 Short sellers took a beating last week following Tesla’s post-earnings romp that shot the stock higher by more than 25%. TSLA posted its best trading day in over a decade when management announced it topped Q3 profit estimates and improved automotive gross margins. Just two days later, the shorts banked losses of $4.2 billion closing out bets against the stock during its historic rally, according to data from S3 Partners. Not bad for a company so many investors love to hate… It’s no secret Tesla is a company that evokes strong emotions from just about everybody. Whether we’re talking about Elon Musk’s politics or online trolling, the latest Cybertruck recalls, or dwindling demand throughout the EV space, even casual investors held negative opinions on Tesla following its ugly first-half performance. Tesla shares were driven into the ground despite a roaring bull market for mega-cap tech earlier this year. And even as the stock began to show signs of bottoming out over the summer, most investors continued to expect the worst. I started getting bulled up on TSLA in late June as the beaten-down stock approached a potential breakout at $200. My reasoning was simple: The stock chart was quickly improving, posting a positive reaction to mediocre earnings back in April. Meanwhile, the bearish arguments were getting louder. Well, that $200 breakout lit the fuse for a quick 30% rally in July. And after a hard reset, shares were once again perking up as the fourth quarter began. Following last week’s earnings beat, the stock is now green on the year and threatening to run to $300… and beyond. Why does any of this matter? Because TSLA’s earnings rally was a potential preview of what’s coming when more of the Mag 7 mega-caps report this week. Earnings are unavoidable for anyone with a trading timeframe longer than a couple of months. But momentum and swing traders can mostly avoid earnings surprises if they so choose. That’s usually my style: selling (or partially selling) open swing trades ahead of earnings announcements, and making a point to avoid jumping into a new play directly in front of an earnings release. But I do keep a close watch on earnings, specifically how the Street reacts to the numbers. If TSLA is any indication, we could be in for more than a few powerful post-earnings rallies this week as many of the biggest names report. Here’s what you should expect… Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)Market cap: $2.06 trillion Reports Tuesday (Oct 29) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.84 per shareRevenue – $86.39B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.95 per share Actual: $2.94 per share Revenue – Consensus: 64.38B Actual: $68.71B Google (I refuse to call this company Alphabet) missed its annual earnings estimates for the 2022 fiscal year. But revenue remained on track. The company is back in the habit of beating earnings regularly, crushing April’s estimates by 25%. Turning to the chart, we have a lovely setup for a post-earnings rally should the numbers impress investors: GOOG is up more than 90% since the Nov. 2022 bottom, yet it’s approximately 15% off its all-time highs logged on July 10. The stock decisively cleared its 2021 peak in April, breaking into new all-time highs.

Title: This 8% Dividend Is The Perfect Buy As Markets Turn Choppy

Old man and the sea, in a rowboat or skiff paddling and fighting the waves of the ocean. I get it if you’re a bit wary of this latest market rally: We’ve got a volatile (to say the least!) election now days away. And while the Fed says rates are headed lower, there’s still a lingering uncertainty about where, exactly, they’ll land. While a bit of anxiety is understandable, we do not want to make the same mistake many “vanilla” investors do at times like these: go all into cash. For one, humans are terrible at predicting the future—remember those warnings of a 100% chance of a recession in 2023?—so safe to say a good number of today’s investment worries are unlikely to come to pass. Worse, for us dividend investors, going to cash carries an extra cost: We lose our income stream. And if you’re in closed-end funds (CEFs), you stand to lose a lot of income indeed: CEFs yield around 8% as I write this, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service yields even more: around 9.4% as I write this. Just as a fast aside before we go further: One thing that bothers me about the discussion around CEFs these days is that people who don’t know much about them talk about them like they’re speculative investments. Nothing could be further from the truth: Fact is, CEFs are heavily regulated. Just like big companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Home Depot (HD) or Walmart (WMT), CEFs must account for their operations and file statements with the SEC every quarter. Even more reassuringly, most CEFs are managed by big financial institutions, which have a lot of investment resources at their disposal, as well as access to top portfolio-management talent and deep connections in the markets in which their funds operate. So instead of going to cash, we’re taking a pragmatic, dividend-focused (and CEF-focused) approach to the potential volatility ahead: We’re going to: The first thing that jumps out about ADX (besides the dividend yield) is its age: This one has been around since 1929, so it’s weathered the Great Depression, Second World War, soaring rates, falling rates, financial crises, a pandemic, you name it. (I’ve actually heard of some people who pass their holding in ADX down from generation to generation.) Adams has parlayed its long institutional experience into a stellar total return for ADX—nearly 3,500% since late 1988! This is where the fund’s value comes in, because as I write this, ADX trades at an 11.5% discount to NAV, letting us buy in below the value of its assets. (Or 11.5% less than where these stocks trade today, if you were to buy them “direct” yourself.) This discount is a holdover from a few months back, when the fund had a policy of paying most of its dividend as a year-end special payout that could be difficult to predict. Many CEF investors either didn’t understand the payout structure or were too impatient, so they left ADX aside. But management changed that policy and now will pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That should help ADX’s discount narrow, pulling its price up as it does. And either way, ADX’s policy really amounts to “translating” its portfolio gains into an income stream for you and me. Given the general direction of the market is up over the long term, it’s fair to expect our payouts to rise in the long run, too. Meantime, the fund’s portfolio is extremely modern. Its holdings have a strong tech bent, giving us a chance to buy rapid growers like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) at that 11.5% discount. ADX Portfolio Plus, as you can see, these top holdings also give us a smattering of non-tech names, like Visa (V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The 8% yield means that an investment of $500,000 in ADX would kick out roughly $40,000 of annual income, allowing you to live off dividends while reducing the need to draw down your principal. Here’s another fun fact: While the vast majority of that quadruple-digit return ADX has posted since 1988 was in dividend payouts that were then reinvested, the payout hasn’t hogged the entire spotlight: Shares traded for around $9.75 each back in 1988 and have more than doubled since: They’re around $22 now. So even if you took out all of those dividends and spent them to pay your bills, take vacations, invest elsewhere, whatever—you still saw your original buy double. Not bad!

Old man and the sea, in a rowboat or skiff paddling and fighting the waves of the ocean. I get it if you’re a bit wary of this latest market rally: We’ve got a volatile (to say the least!) election now days away. And while the Fed says rates are headed lower, there’s still a lingering uncertainty about where, exactly, they’ll land. While a bit of anxiety is understandable, we do not want to make the same mistake many “vanilla” investors do at times like these: go all into cash. For one, humans are terrible at predicting the future—remember those warnings of a 100% chance of a recession in 2023?—so safe to say a good number of today’s investment worries are unlikely to come to pass. Worse, for us dividend investors, going to cash carries an extra cost: We lose our income stream. And if you’re in closed-end funds (CEFs), you stand to lose a lot of income indeed: CEFs yield around 8% as I write this, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service yields even more: around 9.4% as I write this. Just as a fast aside before we go further: One thing that bothers me about the discussion around CEFs these days is that people who don’t know much about them talk about them like they’re speculative investments. Nothing could be further from the truth: Fact is, CEFs are heavily regulated. Just like big companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Home Depot (HD) or Walmart (WMT), CEFs must account for their operations and file statements with the SEC every quarter. Even more reassuringly, most CEFs are managed by big financial institutions, which have a lot of investment resources at their disposal, as well as access to top portfolio-management talent and deep connections in the markets in which their funds operate. So instead of going to cash, we’re taking a pragmatic, dividend-focused (and CEF-focused) approach to the potential volatility ahead: We’re going to: The first thing that jumps out about ADX (besides the dividend yield) is its age: This one has been around since 1929, so it’s weathered the Great Depression, Second World War, soaring rates, falling rates, financial crises, a pandemic, you name it. (I’ve actually heard of some people who pass their holding in ADX down from generation to generation.) Adams has parlayed its long institutional experience into a stellar total return for ADX—nearly 3,500% since late 1988! This is where the fund’s value comes in, because as I write this, ADX trades at an 11.5% discount to NAV, letting us buy in below the value of its assets. (Or 11.5% less than where these stocks trade today, if you were to buy them “direct” yourself.) This discount is a holdover from a few months back, when the fund had a policy of paying most of its dividend as a year-end special payout that could be difficult to predict. Many CEF investors either didn’t understand the payout structure or were too impatient, so they left ADX aside. But management changed that policy and now will pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That should help ADX’s discount narrow, pulling its price up as it does.

Title: Miami’s Tech-Leasing Boom Peaks as Projects Stall and Companies Balk
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/10/miami-tech-office-leasing-2024-2025/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T13:30:04Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy The 8,300-square-foot office in Miami Beach marked Andreessen Horowitz’s latest bet. Long one of the biggest players in Silicon Valley, the venture capital firm had signed a lease at Starwood Capital Group’s swanky headquarters building in 2022. The deal showed Andreessen Horowitz’s commitment to remake the Miami region into a leading tech hub. But less than two years later, the firm, which made a name for itself with early investments in Facebook, Instagram and Airbnb, took an L on its South Florida bet. It abruptly closed the office — cutting short its lease by three years — while expanding its base on the West Coast. As the pandemic has wound down, so has the Miami region’s bid to become the next Silicon Valley, at least for now. Interest in cryptocurrency, which local leaders touted, particularly in Miami proper, has cratered. Venture capital investments in Miami have plunged. Tech leasing is down, with developers failing to land anchor tech tenants to launch new office buildings. All the while, San Francisco, despite the grumbles of top tech executives over its liberal politics and crime rate, has managed to stay on top, thanks to the emergence of the artificial intelligence industry. “Let’s just be frank about it: We were mixing the Kool-Aid without the capital,” said Miami-based venture capitalist Jeff Ransdell. “It’s like having a Ferrari in your garage with no gas.” In the beginning, though, there was no shortage of excitement. Fed up with Bay Area liberals and locked up in their houses at the onset of the pandemic, conservative tech executives wanted an alternative. Miami became the answer. Unlike California, the Magic City and its host state offered unrestricted living, sunny weather and low taxes. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez turned into an overly supportive cheerleader, coaxing tech leaders to move. As they poured in, the newly minted transplants proudly extolled the city’s benefits. Bars in Miami Beach, Wynwood and Brickell hosted tech-themed happy hours nearly every night. Altogether, the hype created something of a movement and helped put Miami on the map as a budding tech hub. “That type of community and structure brought seriousness to the Miami market,” said David Seifer, a Miami-based lawyer who runs Bilzin Sumberg’s corporate practice, specializing in tech companies. Miami made great progress. Microsoft and Apple, new-to-market tech giants, signed 50,000-square-foot leases in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Wynwood, a mural-filled neighborhood, emerged as a startup destination, attracting venture capital firms Atomic and Founders Fund, the latter of which was started by billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. Spotify opened a 20,000-square-foot Latin American headquarters, also in Wynwood, three years ago. Amazon remains in the market. The e-commerce heavyweight is in advanced negotiations to take between 60,000 and 80,000 square feet at L&L Holding Company and Oak Row Equities’s Wynwood Plaza development, which remains under construction, according to sources familiar with the pending deal. Miami went all in on cryptocurrency, too. The city hosted the Bitcoin 2021 conference, which drew about 12,000 attendees, making it one of the first mass gatherings in the U.S. after the COVID lockdowns. FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange run by now-imprisoned Sam Bankman-Fried, won the naming rights for the city’s waterfront NBA arena as part of a $135 million deal. The City of Miami, at the behest of its mayor, created its own digital coin. But just two years into Miami’s experiment, crypto crashed (and has only mildly recovered). The meltdown dealt a stinging blow to Miami’s mission to shed its unserious, party-centric image. Interest rates were also steadily rising, which made it difficult for startups to raise capital and grow. This year, venture capital funding for Miami-based companies is on track to plummet, having recorded only $1 billion in deals during the first six months — a far cry from the $5.5 billion raised throughout 2022, according to data from Pitchbook. Office landlords that had banked on tech tenants have taken a hit, including Brick & Timber Collective. In 2022, the San Francisco-based investor purchased the Cube Wynwd, an eight-story office building in Wynwood, for $62 million, with Blockchain.com set as the anchor tenant. But the cryptocurrency tenant never moved in to its 22,000-square-foot office. Within four months of Brick & Timber’s purchase, the leasing brokers sued the landlord to receive their commission. The lender of the nearby Gateway at Wynwood office building sued the owner, R&B Realty Group this year, after it allegedly failed to pay back $102 million in debt, despite landing notable tech tenants, such as OpenStore, a startup cofounded by Keith Rabois, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist who became perhaps the loudest and proudest proponent of Miami tech. Wynwood as a whole has yet to recover. While the Biscayne corridor, which includes Wynwood, boasts some of Miami-Dade County’s highest asking rents, averaging $70.79 a square foot, it also boasts one of the county’s highest vacancy rates, hovering just shy of 20 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield (CWK)’s latest data. So far this year, tech leasing across Miami-Dade County has slowed, generating 111,661 square feet in deals — less than half the previous year, which nabbed 227,717 feet in lease agreements, per C&W. The sluggish leasing pace has slowed the office development pipeline across town. During the height of the tech frenzy, developers were quick to announce office projects. Years later, many have yet to materialize. In perhaps the most public snafu, Stephen Ross’s Related Companies partnered with Swire Properties to develop an 80-story office skyscraper in the heart of Brickell, which could have become the city’s tallest building. So far, the joint venture has failed to secure an anchor tenant or reach a 30 percent pre-lease benchmark, typical requirements for lenders before they fund construction. “Miami is not a market that routinely signs 200,000-square-foot office leases. It’s not like New York City or Chicago,” Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Miami-based 13th Floor Investments, said during Commercial Observer’s annual South Florida development and investment event in Miami this month. “A big lease in Miami is 40,000 square feet.” Tech companies, especially startups, don’t always have good credit ratings. Even smaller, 150,000-square-foot office projects, spearheaded by high-profile developers Goldman Properties and Dacra, have yet to break ground, despite being announced two years ago. In the meantime, San Francisco and its surrounding region are staging a tech comeback. While still struggling with a glut of empty offices, artificial intelligence has breathed new life into the area’s tech scene and office market, accounting for more than 1.7 million square feet in leasing in the city alone since 2022. To level up, Miami is missing some key elements. For one, it doesn’t have the same breadth of tech investors as the Bay Area, according to Ransdell, who founded Miami-based Fuel Venture Capital in 2016. “You can have all the ideas in the world, but without the investor fueling that, it never happens,” the venture capitalist said. The region also lacks world-class universities. The Bay Area boasts Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley, which provide a steady pipeline of new entrepreneurs and sought-after hires. Even though the number of tech-centric jobs has grown in South Florida since 2020, companies are still struggling to fill all their open positions, making them hesitant to commit to years-long office leases, according to Alexandra Poses, an urban strategist at South Florida consulting firm The Euclid Group, who has studied tech hubs. It takes time to blossom into a tech mecca. “Silicon Valley has been around for 50 years, and Miami is only just emerging as a tech hub,” Poses added. Thanks in part to its proximity to New York, Miami’s recent quest to become the Wall Street of the South has fared better. The city landed the global headquarters of Ken Griffin’s sister companies, hedge fund Citadel and market maker Citadel Securities, from Chicago. The billionaire plans to build a 54-story headquarters tower, designed by world-famous architect Norman Foster, along Brickell’s waterfront. A slew of other high-profile financial firms also expanded their presence in Miami during the pandemic, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Millennium Management and Point72 Asset Management — all of which are headquartered in New York. For others, however, these rebranding efforts, whether it be tech or finance, are nothing new for Miami. “There’s always a new fad that gets people excited. They use that to sell condos and to generate investment interest for office space,” said Peter Zalewski, a condo analyst and longtime resident of South Florida. “But, at the end of the day, it always craps out. “It’s like taking two steps forward, one step back. That’s how you progress when you’re a young community that’s 125 years old.” Julia Echikson can be reached at jechikson@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Meta’s AI Abundance

Full Content:
On the business, strategy, and impact of technology. Loading Stratechery has benefited from a Meta cheat code since its inception: wait for investors to panic, the stock to drop, and write an Article that says Meta is fine — better than fine even — and sit back and watch the take be proven correct. Notable examples include 2013’s post-IPO swoon, the 2018 Stories swoon, and most recently, the 2022 TikTok/Reels swoon (if you want a bonus, I was optimistic during the 2020 COVID swoon too): Perhaps with that in mind I wrote a cautionary note earlier this year about Meta and Reasonable Doubt: while investors were concerned about the sustainability of Meta’s spending on AI, I was worried about increasing ad prices and the lack of new formats after Stories and then Reels; the long-term future, particularly in terms of the metaverse, was just as much of a mystery as always. Six months on and I feel the exact opposite: it seems increasingly clear to me that Meta is in fact the most well-placed company to take advantage of generative AI. Yes, investors are currently optimistic, so this isn’t my usual contrarian take — unless you consider the fact that I think Meta has the potential to be the most valuable company in the world. As evidence of that fact I’m writing today, a day before Meta’s earnings: I don’t care if they’re up or down, because the future is that bright. Generative AI is clearly a big deal, but the biggest winner so far is Nvidia, in one of the clearest examples of the picks-and-shovels ethos on which San Francisco was founded: the most money to be made is in furnishing the Forty-niners (yes, I am using a linear scale instead of the log scale above for effect): The big question weighing on investors’ minds is when all of this GPU spend will generate a return. Tesla and xAI are dreaming of autonomy; Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, and Oracle want to undergird the next generation of AI-powered startups; and Microsoft and Salesforce are bickering about how to sell AI into the enterprise. All of these bets are somewhat speculative; what would be the most valuable in the short-term, at least in terms of justifying the massive ongoing capital expenditure necessary to create the largest models, is a guaranteed means to translate those costs into bottom-line benefit. Meta is the best positioned to do that in the short-term, thanks to the obvious benefit of applying generative AI to advertising. Meta is already highly reliant on machine learning for its ads product: right now an advertiser can buy ads based on desired outcomes, whether that be an app install or a purchase, and leave everything else up to Meta; Meta will work across their vast troves of data in a way that is only possible using machine learning-derived algorithms to find the right targets for an ad and deliver exactly the business goals requested. What makes this process somewhat galling for the advertiser is that the more of a black box Meta’s advertising becomes the better the advertising results, even as Meta makes more margin. The big reason for the former is the App Tracking Transparency (ATT)-driven shift in digital advertising to probabilistic models in place of deterministic ones. It used to be that ads shown to users could be perfectly matched to conversions made in 3rd-party apps or on 3rd-party websites; Meta was better at this than everyone else, thanks to its scale and fully built-out ad infrastructure (including SDKs in apps and pixels on websites), but this was a type of targeting and conversion tracking that could be done in some fashion by other entities, whether that be smaller social networks like Snap, ad networks, or even sophisticated marketers themselves. ATT severed that link, and Meta’s business suffered greatly; from a February post-earnings Update: It is worth noting that while the digital ecosystem did not disappear, it absolutely did shrink: [MoffettNathanson’s Michael] Nathanson, in his Meta earnings note, explained what he was driving at with that question: While revenues have recovered, with +22% organic growth in the fourth quarter, we think that the more important driver of the outperformance has been the company’s focus on tighter cost controls. Coming in 2023, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a New Year’s resolution, declaring 2023 the “Year of Efficiency.” By remaining laser-focused on reining in expense growth as the top line reaccelerated, Meta’s operating margins (excluding restructuring) expanded almost +1,100 bps vs last 4Q, reaching nearly 44%. Harking back to Zuckerberg’s resolution, Meta’s 2023 was, in fact, highly efficient… Putting this in perspective, two years ago, after the warnings on the 4Q 2021 earnings call, we forecasted that Meta Family of Apps would generate $155 billion of revenues and nearly $68 billion of GAAP operating income in 2023. Fast forward to today, and last night Meta reported that Family of Apps delivered only $134.3 billion of revenues ($22 billion below our 2-year ago estimate), yet FOA operating income (adjusted for one-time expenses) was amazingly in-line with that two-year old forecast. For 2024, while we now forecast Family of Apps revenues of $151.2 billion (almost $30 billion below the forecast made on February 2, 2022), our current all-in Meta operating profit estimate of $56.8 billion is also essentially in line. In essence, Meta has emerged as a more profitable (dare we say, efficient) business. That shrunken revenue figure is digital advertising that simply disappeared — in many cases, along with the companies that bought it — in the wake of ATT. The fact that Meta responded by becoming so much leaner, though, was critical to not just surviving ATT, but also laid the groundwork for where the company is going next. Increased company efficiency is a reason to be bullish on Meta, but three years on, the key takeaway from ATT is that it validated my thesis that Meta is anti-fragile. From 2020’s Apple and Facebook: This is a very different picture from Facebook, where as of Q1 2019 the top 100 advertisers made up less than 20% of the company’s ad revenue; most of the $69.7 billion the company brought in last year came from its long tail of 8 million advertisers. This focus on the long-tail, which is only possible because of Facebook’s fully automated ad-buying system, has turned out to be a tremendous asset during the coronavirus slow-down… This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever. In this way Facebook has a degree of anti-fragility that even Google lacks: so much of its business comes from the long tail of Internet-native companies that are built around Facebook from first principles, that any disruption to traditional advertisers — like the coronavirus crisis or the current boycotts — actually serves to strengthen the Facebook ecosystem at the expense of the TV-centric ecosystem of which these CPG companies are a part. Make no mistake, a lot of these kinds of companies were killed by ATT; the ones that survived, though, emerged into a world where no one other than Meta — thanks in part to a massive GPU purchase the same month the company reached its most-recent stock market nadir — had the infrastructure to rebuild the type of ad system they depended on. This rebuild had to be probabilistic — making a best guess as to the right target, and, more confoundingly, a best guess as to conversion — which is only workable with an astronomical amount of data and an astronomical amount of infrastructure to process that data, such that advertisers could once again buy based on promised results, and have those promises met. Now into this cauldron Meta is adding generative AI. Advertisers have long understood the importance of giving platforms like Meta multiple pieces of creative for ads; Meta’s platform will test different pieces of creative with different audiences and quickly hone in on what works, putting more money behind the best arrow. Generative AI puts this process on steroids: advertisers can provide Meta with broad parameters and brand guidelines, and let the black box not just test out a few pieces of creative, but an effectively unlimited amount. Critically, this generative AI application has a verification function: did the generated ad generate more revenue or less? That feedback function, meanwhile, is data in its own right, and can be leveraged to better target individuals in the future. The second piece to all of this — the galling part I referenced above — is the margin question. The Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Google’s ad business explains why black boxes are so beneficial to big ad platforms: Over time, as Google’s monopoly over the publisher ad server was secured, Google surreptitiously manipulated its Google Ads’ bids to ensure it won more high-value ad inventory on Google’s ad exchange while maintaining its own profit margins by charging much higher fees on inventory that it expected to be less competitive. In doing so, Google was able to keep both categories of inventory out of the hands of rivals by competing in ways that rivals without similar dominant positions could not. In doing so, Google preserved its own profits across the ad tech stack, to the detriment of publishers. Once again, Google engaged in overt monopoly behavior by grabbing publisher revenue and keeping it for itself. Google called this plan “Project Bernanke.” I’m skeptical about the DOJ’s case for reasons I laid out in this Update; publishers made more money using Google’s ad server than they would have otherwise, while the advertisers, who paid more, are not locked in. The black box effect, however, is real: platforms like Google or Meta can meet an advertiser’s goals — at a price point determined by an open auction — without the advertisers knowing which ads worked and which ones didn’t, keeping the margin from the latter. The galling bit is that this works out best for everyone: these platforms are absolutely finding customers you wouldn’t get otherwise, which means advertisers earn more when the platforms earn more too, and these effects will only be supercharged with generative ads. There’s more upside for Meta, too. Google and Amazon will benefit from generative ads, but I expect the effect will be the most powerful at the top of the funnel where Meta’s advertising operates, as opposed to the bottom-of-the-funnel search ads where Amazon and Google make most of their money. Moreover, there is that long tail I mentioned above: one of the challenges for Meta in moving from text (Feed) to images (Stories) to video (Reels) is that effective creative becomes more difficult to execute, especially if you want multiple variations. Meta has devoted a lot of resources over the years to tooling to help advertisers make effective ads, much of which will be obviated by generative AI. This, by extension, will give long tail advertisers more access to more inventory, which will increase demand and ultimately increase prices. There is one more channel that is exclusive to Meta: text-to-message ads. These are ads where the conversion event is initiating a chat with an advertiser, an e-commerce channel that is particularly popular in Asia. The distinguishing factor in the markets where these ads are taking off is low labor costs, which AI addresses. Zuckerberg explained in a 2023 earnings call: And then the one that I think is going to have the fastest direct business loop is going to be around helping people interact with businesses. You can imagine a world on this where over time, every business has as an AI agent that basically people can message and interact with. And it’s going to take some time to get there, right? I mean, this is going to be a long road to build that out. But I think that, that’s going to improve a lot of the interactions that people have with businesses as well as if that does work, it should alleviate one of the biggest issues that we’re currently having around messaging monetization is that in order for a person to interact with a business, it’s quite human labor-intensive for a person to be on the other side of that interaction, which is one of the reasons why we’ve seen this take off in some countries where the cost of labor is relatively low. But you can imagine in a world where every business has an AI agent, that we can see the kind of success that we’re seeing in Thailand or Vietnam with business messaging could kind of spread everywhere. And I think that’s quite exciting. Both of these use cases — generative ads and click-to-message AI agents — are great examples as to why it makes sense for Meta to invest in its Llama models and make them open(ish): more and better AI means more and better creative and more and better agents, all of which can be monetized via advertising. Of course all of this depends on people continuing to use Meta properties, and here AI plays an important role as well. First, there is the addition of Meta AI, which makes Meta’s apps more useful. Meta AI also opens the door to a search-like product, which The Information just reported the company was working on; potential search advertising is a part of the bull case as well, although for me a relatively speculative one. Second is the insertion of AI content into the Meta content experience, which Meta just announced it is working on. From The Verge: If you think avoiding AI-generated images is difficult as it is, Facebook and Instagram are now going to put them directly into your feeds. At the Meta Connect event on Wednesday, the company announced that it’s testing a new feature that creates AI-generated content for you “based on your interests or current trends” — including some that incorporate your face. When you come across an “Imagined for You” image in your feed, you’ll see options to share the image or generate a new picture in real time. One example (embedded below) shows several AI-generated images of “an enchanted realm, where magic fills the air.” But others could contain your face… which I’d imagine will be a bit creepy to stumble upon as you scroll… In a statement to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Amanda Felix says the platform will only generate AI images of your face if you “onboarded to Meta’s Imagine yourself feature, which includes adding photos to that feature” and accepting its terms. You’ll be able to remove AI images from your feed as well. This sounds like a company crossing the Rubicon, but in fact said crossing already happened a few years ago. Go back to 2015’s Facebook and the Feed, where I argued that Facebook was too hung up on being a social network, and concluded: Consider Facebook’s smartest acquisition, Instagram. The photo-sharing service is valuable because it is a network, but it initially got traction because of filters. Sometimes what gets you started is only a lever to what makes you valuable. What, though, lies beyond the network? That was Facebook’s starting point, and I think the answer to what lies beyond is clear: the entire online experience of over a billion people. Will Facebook seek to protect its network — and Zuckerberg’s vision — or make a play to be the television of mobile? It took Facebook another five years — and the competitive threat of TikTok — but the company finally did make the leap to showing you content from across the entire service, not just that which was posted by your network. The latter was an artificial limitation imposed by the company’s own self-conception of itself as a social network, when in reality it is a content network; true social networking — where you talk to people you actually know — happens in group chats: The structure of this illustration may look familiar; it’s another manifestation of The Smiling Curve, which I first wrote about in the context of publishing: Over time, as this cycle repeats itself and as people grow increasingly accustomed to getting most of their “news” from Facebook (or Google or Twitter), value moves to the ends, just like it did in the IT manufacturing industry or smartphone industry: On the right you have the content aggregators, names everyone is familiar with: Google ($369.7 billion), Facebook ($209.0 billion), Twitter ($26.4 billion), Pinterest (private). They are worth by far the most of anyone in this discussion. Traditional publishers, meanwhile, are stuck in the middle…publishers (all of them, not just newspapers) don’t really have an exclusive on anything anymore. They are Acer, offering the same PC as the next guy, and watching as the lion’s share of the value goes to the folks who are actually putting the content in front of readers. It speaks to the inevitability of the smiling curve that it has even come for Facebook (which I wrote about in 2020’s Social Networking 2.0); moving to global content and purely individualized feeds unconstrained by your network was the aforementioned Rubicon crossing. The provenance of that content is a tactical question, not a strategic one. To that end, I’ve heard whispers that these AI content tests are going extremely well, which raises an interesting financial question. One of Meta’s great strengths is that it gets its content for free from users. There certainly are costs incurred in personalizing your feed, but this is one of the rare cases where AI content is actually more expensive. It’s possible, though, that it simply is that much better and more engaging, in part because it is perfectly customized to you. This leads to a third medium-term AI-derived benefit that Meta will enjoy: at some point ads will be indistinguishable from content. You can already see the outlines of that given I’ve discussed both generative ads and generative content; they’re the same thing! That image that is personalized to you just might happen to include a sweater or a belt that Meta knows you probably want; simply click-to-buy. It’s not just generative content, though: AI can figure out what is in other content, including authentic photos and videos. Suddenly every item in that influencer photo can be labeled and linked — provided the supplier bought into the black box, of course — making not just every piece of generative AI a potential ad, but every piece of content period. The market implications of this are profound. One of the oddities of analyzing digital ad platforms is that some of the most important indicators are counterintuitive; I wrote this spring: The most optimistic time for Meta’s advertising business is, counter-intuitively, when the price-per-ad is dropping, because that means that impressions are increasing. This means that Meta is creating new long-term revenue opportunities, even as its ads become cost competitive with more of its competitors; it’s also notable that this is the point when previous investor freak-outs have happened. When I wrote that I was, as I noted in the introduction, feeling more cautious about Meta’s business, given that Reels is built out and the inventory opportunities of Meta AI were not immediately obvious. I realize now, though, that I was distracted by Meta AI: the real impact of AI is to make everything inventory, which is to say that the price-per-ad on Meta will approach $0 for basically forever. Would-be competitors are finding it difficult enough to compete with Meta’s userbase and resources in a probabilisitic world; to do so with basically zero price umbrella seems all-but-impossible. Notice that I am thousands of words into this Article and, like Meta Myths, haven’t even mentioned VR or AR. Meta’s AI-driven upside is independent from XR becoming the platform of the future. What is different now, though, is that the likelihood of XR mattering feels dramatically higher than it did even six months ago. The first one is obviously Orion, which I wrote about last month. Augmented reality is definitely going to be a thing — I would buy a pair of Meta’s prototypes now if they were for sale. Once again, however, the real enabler will be AI. In the smartphone era, user interfaces started out being pixel perfect, and have gradually evolved into being declarative interfaces that scale to different device sizes. AI, however, will enable generative UI, where you are only presented with the appropriate UI to accomplish the specific task at hand. This will be somewhat useful on phones, and much more compelling on something like a smartwatch; instead of having to craft an interface for a tiny screen, generative UIs will surface exactly what you need when you need it, and nothing else. Where this will really make a difference is with hardware like Orion. Smartphone UI’s will be clunky and annoying in augmented reality; the magic isn’t in being pixel perfect, but rather being able to do something with zero friction. Generative UI will make this possible: you’ll only see what you need to see, and be able to interact with it via neural interfaces like the Orion neural wristband. Oh, and this applies to ads as well: everything in the world will be potential inventory. AI will have a similarly transformative effect on VR, which I wrote about back in 2022 in DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Content. That article traced the evolution of both games and user-generated content from text to images to video to 3D; the issue is that games had hit a wall, given the cost of producing compelling 3D content, and that that challenge would only be magnified by the immersive nature of VR. Generative AI, though, will solve that problem: In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs. Here once again Meta’s advantages come to the fore: not only are they leading the way in VR with the Quest line of headsets, but they are also justified in building out the infrastructure necessary to generate metaverses — advertising included — because every part of their business benefits from AI. This was all a lot of words to explain the various permutations of an obvious truth: a world of content abundance is going to benefit the biggest content Aggregator first and foremost. Of course Meta needs to execute on all of these vectors, but that is where they also benefit from being founder-led, particularly given the fact that founder seems more determined and locked in than ever. It’s also going to cost a lot of money, both in terms of training and inference. The inference part is inescapable: Meta may have a materially higher cost of revenue in the long run. The training part, however, has some intriguing possibilities. Specifically, Meta’s AI opportunities are so large and so central to the company’s future, that there is no question that Zuckerberg will spend whatever is necessary to keep pushing Llama forward. Other companies, however, with less obvious use cases, or more dependency on third-party development that may take longer than expected to generate real revenue, may at some point start to question their infrastructure spend, and wonder if it might make more sense to simply license Llama (this is where the “ish” part of “openish” looms large). It’s definitely plausible that Meta ends up being subsidized for building the models that give the company so much upside. Regardless, it’s good to be back on the Meta bull train, no matter what tomorrow’s earnings say about last quarter or next year. Stratechery from the beginning has been focused on the implications of abundance and the companies able to navigate it on behalf of massive user bases — the Aggregators. AI takes abundance to infinity, and Meta is the purest play of all. Loading

Title: Third-quarter earnings season has been "solid" so far, Bank of America says

Investing.com -- The third-quarter earnings season has been solid so far, with corporate incomes topping expectations set at the start of the reporting period in early October, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities. Traders are currently assessing a busy week that will see roughly 169 S&P 500 companies unveil their latest returns, including figures from the so-called "Magnificent Seven" group of tech industry giants like Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), software player Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). One of the key questions lingering over the latest quarterly results is whether they will support recently elevated stock valuations. According to LSEG data cited by Reuters, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio -- a gauge of earnings estimates for the next 12 months -- stood at 21.8 last week, close to the highest level in more than three years. The earnings deluge, along with a raft of US economic data and the upcoming US presidential election on Nov. 5, could test the staying power of these frothy valuations. In a note dated on Oct. 28, the BofA analysts led by credit strategist Yuri Seliger noted that 37% of investment-grade US public companies had reported 38% of the expected aggregate third-quarter earnings. "The results reported so far have been relatively strong," the BofA analysts said, citing an internal earnings tracker. "Based on the actual results when available and bottom-up expectations otherwise, we are tracking a +5.1% and +4.4% year-on-year earnings and revenue growth, respectively." They added that returns so far have come in 5% above estimates established at the beginning of the quarterly earnings season on Oct. 7 -- higher than a 1.9% positive surprise in the second quarter and 3.7% pre-pandemic average. Revenues have also been stronger than either of those periods as well, the analysts noted.

Credit risk refers to the possibility that the debt issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions. TIPS can provide investors a hedge against inflation, as the inflation adjustment feature helps preserve the purchasing power of the investment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed rate bonds and will likely decline in price during periods of deflation, which could result in losses. Government backing applies only to government issued securities, and does not apply to the funds. The iShares ® iBonds ® Ladder ETFs will hold 5 iBonds ETFs (the Underlying Funds), spanning 5 consecutive maturity years. The Underlying Index is reconstituted each June such that the iBonds ETF with the nearest maturity is removed from the Underlying Index and the iBonds ETF with a five-year maturity is added. If an iBonds ETF is not available for a given maturity year within the five-year range, the Underlying Index will hold fewer iBonds ETF constituents. An investment in the Fund(s) is not guaranteed, and an investor may experience losses, including near or at the reconstitution date. Unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, the Fund(s) will make distributions of income that vary over time. In the final months of each Underlying Funds' operation, as the bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash-like instruments. As a result, its yield will tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Underlying Fund and lower than prevailing yields in the bond market. The Funds' distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of investment and the Funds do not seek to return any predetermined amount. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of an investor's returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in bonds. If the amount an investor receives as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than the investor's cost basis, the investor may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes. Investment in a fund of funds is subject to the risks and expenses of the underlying funds. Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) report earning after markets close today; Ford (F) shares are sinking as the automaker reported third-quarter profit that was lower than expectation and cut its full-year outlook; McDonald's (MCD) shares are falling after same-store sales declined by more than estimates; and Boeing (BA) raises $21 billion as the machinists union strike continues. Here's what investors need to know today. Investors are anticipating the earnings report from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) after markets close today, with analysts expecting the tech giant to post a third-quarter revenue jump of more than 12% year-over-year to $86.41 billion. Alphabet is also expected to report profit of $23.05 billion, or $1.85 a share, up from $19.69 billion, or $1.55 per share. Investors will also likely be watching for commentary from new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Anat Ashkenazi, who took over the role in July. Shares of Alphabet are edging higher in premarket trading. McDonald's (MCD) shares are falling 2.5% in premarket trading after it reported mixed third-quarter results, with revenue of $6.87 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23 coming in better than estimates but net income of $2.26 billion and a same-store sales decline of 1.5% were worse than expected. McDonald's report comes as the company deals with an E. coli outbreak that caused it to briefly suspend Quarter Pounder sales in certain states. Shares of Ford (F) are down 6% in premarket trading after the automaker reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts' expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook. Ford's net income of $900 million, or 22 cents per share, declined from $1.2 billion, or 30 cents per share, last year and missed analysts' consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The automaker said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of about $10 billion, compared to its previous projection of between $10 billion and $12 billion. Analysts are expecting to see significant earnings growth from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) when the chipmaker reports third-quarter financial results after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect the chipmaker to report revenue of $6.71 billion, up nearly 16% year-over-year, while the company's net income is projected to be $815.8 million, or 50 cents per share, more than double last year's $299 million, or 18 cents per share. The report comes as investors are watching the company's data center revenue, which the chipmaker doubled in its second-quarter report. AMD shares are up almost 1% in premarket trading. Boeing (BA) announced that it raised around $21 billion from sales of stock and depositary shares, coming as the troubled aerospace company looks to shore up its finances amid a costly strike by its machinists union. Boeing raised $15.81 billion after it sold 112.5 million common shares for $143 each, lower than the stock's price of $150.69 at Monday's close, and also brought in $4.91 billion from the sale of depositary shares. Shares of Boeing are 1% lower in premarket trading.

Title: Vatican's first annual report on child protection calls for 'rigorous approach to reparations'

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. LAST UPDATE | 29 Oct THE VATICAN HAS published its first annual report on protecting minors in the Catholic Church. Among the recommendations of the pilot annual report is the “need for a streamlined process for discharge from office when warranted”. It also calls for the Church to “study damages and compensation policies to promote a rigorous approach to reparations, as part of the Church’s commitment to the healing journey of victims and survivors”. “Compensation in the Church is not merely reduced to financial aspects,” said the report, “but embraces a much broader spectrum of actions.” These broader actions include public apologies. The report said it will “delve into the pillar of reparations in the next edition to better represent all these needs”. “Economic reparations are particularly relevant, and the Commission will continue to offer its cooperation to key Church bodies,” said the report. The pilot report also calls for the “professionalisation of safeguarding in the Church, by providing formal academic opportunities and adequate resources for aspiring safeguarding practitioners”. The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors presented its first report this morning. Pope Francis established the Commission, consisting of an independent panel of experts, in December 2014, amid pressure for more action to tackle clerical child sex abuse. In 2022, Pope Francis asked for an annual and “reliable account on what is presently being done and what needs to change”. Francis added that he wants a “commitment to conversion away from evil and to healing the wounded”. Pope Francis during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's square at the Vatican on 23 October, 2024 The Commission was then incorporated into the Roman Curia, the government of the Holy See which assists the pope in the day-to-day exercise of his role as the leader of the Catholic Church. In April 2022, Pope Francis called for the annual reports to have a particular focus on the care of survivors of abuse. He told the Commission: “I urge you to assist in establishing suitable centres where individuals who have experienced abuse can find acceptance and an attentive hearing, and be accompanied in a process of healing and justice.” The first annual report is described as a “first step towards a process of data gathering and reporting”, and documents “where risks remain, and where advances can be found in the Church’s efforts to protect children and vulnerable adults”. The pilot report was today launched by the commission’s president, US Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the former archbishop of Boston who has spent decades listening to abuse survivors. Advertisement Cardinal O’Malley thanked the media for their presence at the press conference launching the report and said: “We know that the role you have played in forcing the Church to confront our terrible history with abuse has been very, very important.” He acknowledged that survivors are “tired of empty words” and that nothing the Church does “will ever be enough to fully repair what has happened”. “Your suffering and wounds have opened our eyes to the fact that as a Church, we have failed to care for victims, and that we didn’t defend you, and that we resisted understanding you when you needed us most,” said O’Malley. However, O’Malley said the report will help to “ensure that these events never happen again in the Church”. The annual reports will review safeguarding policies and procedures in around 20 Episcopal conferences each year and ensure there are standardised practices in place. This will include ensuring resources are in place for universal standards in safeguarding and to create centres of reporting and assistance for survivors of clerical abuse. While between 15 and 20 Episcopal conferences, representing local churches, will be reviewed each year, it’s hoped that doing so will result in the entire Church being reviewed over a period of five to six annual reports. Each annual report will also include an analysis of select religious institutes, and the pilot report included a review of the Spiritans. The annual report will also explore the Roman Curia’s role in promoting a culture of safeguarding, which is deemed to “uniquely serve as a hub for sharing good practices in safeguarding”. The Commission also aims to create a “higher degree of transparency in the Roman Curia’s procedures and jurisprudence with regard to individual cases of clerical abuse”. The Spiritans were one of the religious institutions analysed in the pilot report. It emerged in late 2022 that following an RTÉ radio documentary that 233 people had made allegations of abuse against 77 Irish Spiritans in ministries throughout Ireland and abroad. Of those, 57 people alleged they were abused on the Blackrock College campus. The leader of the Spiritans in Ireland, Father Martin Kelly, issued an apology in November 2022 to all victims on behalf of the order. The report voiced concern that in some of the more than 60 countries where the Spiritans operate, “the safeguarding officer is designated in name only and does not have any specific ordinary functions in practice”. The Commission also noted “cultural resistance to safeguarding in members’ countries of origin and in contexts where members work, some of whom see safeguarding as an imposed Western ideology”. “This resistance highlights the challenges in bringing safeguarding guidelines to life, in changing the attitudes of the members,” said the report. It also warned that the Spiritans retain “vestiges of a culture of clericalism with some members”. The Commission will engage with the Spiritans in the revision of new guidelines, set for publication this year, “with a particular focus on building a culture of safeguarding”. Since becoming pope in March 2013, Francis has taken numerous measures to tackle clerical abuse, from opening up internal Church documents to punishing high-ranking clergy, while making it compulsory to report suspicions of sexual assault to Church authorities. In 2019, Pope Francise promised an “all-out battle” against abuse, and compared child sex abuse to human sacrifice. Related Reads Irish woman who resigned from Vatican abuse panel says new report is like 'marking your own homework' But clergy are still not required to report abuse to civil authorities, unless the laws of that country require it, while any revelations made in confession remain private. Maud de Boer Buquicchio, a Dutch lawyer and former UN special rapporteur on the sexual exploitation of children who chaired the Commission’s report, said last week it would help promote a “change of mindset in the Church that embraces accountability and transparency”. During its compilation, “we have been able to explore many of the concerns about the lack of available data”, she added. File image of Maud de Boer-Buquicchio. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Speaking at today’s launch, de Boer Buquicchio said the call for “accountability and justice has gone unanswered in the Church for too long”. However, she said the first annual report “engages Church membership at the highest levels in acknowledging the urgent need to better answer that call”. She added today that the reports will ensure abuse is rare and thoroughly investigated if it does occur. Members of the abuse commission are directly appointed by the pope and are experts in fields related to safeguarding, from clinical psychology to law as well as human rights. But two members representing abuse survivors resigned in 2017, one of whom was Marie Collins, who was raped by a priest in Ireland when she was 13 years old, Collins had decried as “shameful” the lack of cooperation from Vatican officials. At today’s press conference, a journalist asked Cardinal O’Malley about Collins’s resignation. 2012 file image of Marie Collins Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo O’Malley said “Marie Collins was one of our most beloved and valuable members of the Commission” and that he was “sorry when she decided to step away”. “We understood the reasons and all of us have felt that frustration of the slowness of change coming about, but we believe that the change is taking place, even though it’s often an uphill climb.” He added: “The fact that the commission is being embedded within the Roman Curia, and given a permanent status, will be very helpful to our work.” Last year, influential German Jesuit priest Hans Zollner also quit the Commission, complaining about “structural and practical issues”. Meanwhile, O’Malley was also asked by a journalist if “there is a link between celibacy and child sexual abuse”. O’Malley said he has “never seen any serious study” pointing to such a link and that “we are satisfied that celibacy is not the cause of paedophilia”.

Title: Bitcoin hits $71K – Will Uptober, FOMO fuel a new ATH this week?

Bitcoin could form an ATH before the end of Uptober after the recent rally fueled FOMO. Bitcoin [BTC] has been trending up this month and recently reached a 20-week high above $71,500. At press time, BTC traded at $70,900 and was only 3.7% shy of its all-time highs. Several bullish indicators currently suggest that Bitcoin could form a fresh ATH before the end of “Uptober” amid positive market sentiment. A look at the Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price for short-term holders suggests that prices could continue to rise in the short term. Per CryptoQuant, the UTXO Realized Price for wallets that have held BTC for under a month is close to surpassing that of wallets that have held Bitcoin for between three to six months. Past crossovers have often preceded significant price increases. A similar crossover is about to happen, which could strengthen the bullish narrative around BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Short-term holders usually determine the sustainability of a rally. Therefore, if new transactions start occurring at higher prices, it will boost market sentiment and pave the way to an ATH. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 98% of BTC holders are sitting in profits while 1.26% are at a break-even point. Source: IntoTheBlock When wallet profitability increases, it boosts investor confidence as holders become more willing to hold their assets rather than sell. This scenario can also stir the fear of missing out (FOMO). As a result, new buyers could enter the market, reinforcing the uptrend. FOMO is already evident as the Fear and Greed Index sits at 72. This shows that the market is in a state of greed. On 28th October, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their highest inflows in two weeks. Per SoSoValue, inflows during the day came in at $479M, with Blackrock taking the largest share with $315M inflows. Source: SoSoValue As AMBCrypto reported, BlackRock’s BTC holdings have surpassed 400,000 coins, with the asset manager being on track to flipping Satoshi and becoming the largest Bitcoin holder. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold $68.47 billion worth of assets, which is 4.9% of Bitcoin’s supply. In just two weeks, these ETFs have recorded $3 billion in netflows. As Bitcoin attracts new interest from both retail and institutional investors, its market dominance over altcoins has continued to soar. At press time, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 60% while the altcoin season index had dropped to 27.

Fink, whose mammoth fund oversees over $10 trillion in assets, sees one rate reduction before the end of this year, compared to the two trims that other market participants have forecast. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said at a panel during Saudi Arabia's annual flagship investment conference, the Future Investment Initiative. "We have government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost.' Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking," he noted. Fink's mention of onshoring highlighted the U.S.'s efforts in recent years — particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic — to reduce dependence on foreign supply chains and to invest in domestic jobs, particularly in manufacturing. The Biden administration's legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, have pushed those efforts forward. Those changes can contribute to increases in the price of goods, as American workers are paid more than those in many offshore manufacturing destinations like China. "Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we're not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting," Fink said. The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in September, signaling a turning point in its management of the U.S. economy and in its outlook for inflation. In late-September reports, strategists at J.P. Morgan and Fitch Ratings predicted two additional interest rate cuts by the end of 2024, and expect such reductions to continue into 2025. America's consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, was up 2.4% in September compared to the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is a tick down from the 2.5% print of August, meaning that price growth slowed. The September reading was also the smallest annual one since February 2021. A group of CEOs speaking on a subsequent panel at the event — which included Wall Street hegemons such as the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street — were asked to raise their hand if they thought two additional rate cuts would be implemented by the Fed this year. No one put their hand up. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, but it missed analysts' expectations on revenue for the July-through-September period. Here's how the company did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: For the fourth quarter, PayPal is calling for "low single-digit growth." Analysts were expecting growth of 5.4% to $8.46 billion in revenue. The investor deck says guidance reflects a "price-to-value strategy and prioritization of profitable growth." The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.07 to $1.11, versus the average analyst estimate of $1.10, according to LSEG. Revenue increased about 6% in the quarter from $7.42 billion in the same period a year ago. PayPal reported net income of $1.01 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.02 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier. It's the first earnings report for CEO Alex Chriss since he reached his one-year mark on the job in September. Coming into Tuesday, PayPal's stock was up 36% this year and 42% since Chriss joined the payments company, which at the time was mired in a deep slump due to increased competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction. Chriss has focused on prioritizing profitable growth and better monetizing key acquisitions like Braintree, which is used by Meta for credit card processing, and payments app Venmo. Total payment volume, an indication of how digital payments are faring in the broader economy, rose 9% from a year earlier to $422.6 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, and came in just above the average analyst estimate of $422.5 billion, according to StreetAccount. The company's operating margin was 18.8%, beating the StreetAccount estimate of 17.4%. PayPal reported total active accounts of 432 million, up 1% from a year earlier, and beating the average estimate of 430.5 million. While PayPal's take rate slipped to 1.86% from 1.91% a year earlier, transaction margin, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business, rose to 46.6% from 45.4%. One of Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting a couple of data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment. That product, dubbed Fastlane, launched in August, and is a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In August, fintech platform Adyen made Fastlane available to businesses in the U.S., and said it plans to expand the offering globally in the future. The company also partnered with other leaders in global commerce including Fiserv, Amazon, Global Payments and Shopify as it looks to grow its share of online checkout. Fastlane targets the 60% of online payments that aren't using a branded payment option, in the hope that a customer will graduate from guest checkout and convert to becoming a PayPal user. The other big product launch during the quarter was PayPal Everywhere, which went live in early September. The initiative offers 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. Thus far, PayPal has seen 1 million new PayPal debit card enrollments. "All of this is driving back branded checkout growth," Chriss said Tuesday in an earnings call. Venmo's total payment volume rose 8% in the quarter from a year earlier. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. In the short term, Chriss says the two primary monetization levers are the Venmo debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance both online and offline, and Pay With Venmo, which provides a seamless way for customers to pay online. "With these product improvements in place, we're now leaning into marketing for Venmo for the first time in years," Chriss said.

Title: DoubleVerify stock under pressure from ad spend shift to social and CTV – Wells Fargo
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/doubleverify-stock-under-pressure-from-ad-spend-shift-to-social-and-ctv--wells-fargo-93CH-3687617
Time Published: 2024-10-29T10:04:51Z
Full Content:
On Tuesday, Wells Fargo initiated coverage on DoubleVerify (NYSE: NYSE:DV), a software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, assigning an Underweight rating to the company's stock with a price target of $14.00. The new rating reflects concerns about shifting industry dynamics and internal challenges that the company is facing. The financial institution's analysis pointed out that while DoubleVerify had previously benefited from its strong position in programmatic activation, there is now a notable shift in advertising spend from programmatic display towards social media, Connected TV (CTV), and retail media. This transition is seen as turning a once favorable trend into a disadvantage for DoubleVerify. Wells Fargo observed that DoubleVerify's revenue growth decelerated from 29% in the first quarter of 2024 to 17% in the second quarter. Management attributed this slowdown to cyclical challenges impacting six of the company's key customers. However, Wells Fargo also highlighted a broader industry shift as advertisers increasingly allocate their digital spending away from programmatic display and video to other channels. Although DoubleVerify offers products that serve social, CTV, and retail media channels, the firm noted that programmatic channels have historically been more profitable for DoubleVerify. Consequently, the movement of ad dollars represents a structural headwind, according to the analyst's comments. In summary, Wells Fargo's initiation of coverage on DoubleVerify with an Underweight rating and a $14 price target is based on a combination of internal customer-related challenges faced by the company in 2024 and a larger industry trend away from programmatic advertising, which could potentially hinder DoubleVerify's growth and market share. In other recent news, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. has been subject to revised growth expectations and stock price target adjustments from various analyst firms. Truist Securities, Needham, and Canaccord Genuity have all maintained a Buy rating on DoubleVerify, despite lowering their price targets. The Q2 financial results showcased a 17% increase in revenue to $156 million, an 83% gross margin, and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA, driven by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement, and a growing supply side platform business. DoubleVerify has also launched an Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), an initiative to protect advertisers from aligning with controversial content. Anticipated closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot, along with recent partnerships, are expected to positively impact DoubleVerify's revenue starting early 2025. Analysts from Truist Securities and Canaccord Genuity expect DoubleVerify to continue outperforming its closest peer and the overall digital advertising industry. These are the recent developments for DoubleVerify. Recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to Wells Fargo's analysis of DoubleVerify. Despite the challenges highlighted in the article, DoubleVerify maintains some financial strengths. The company boasts impressive gross profit margins, with InvestingPro data showing a gross profit margin of 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This indicates that DoubleVerify still maintains strong pricing power and efficiency in its core operations. However, the market seems to be pricing in significant growth expectations, as evidenced by the company's high P/E ratio of 48.94. This aligns with Wells Fargo's concerns about potential headwinds to growth. The stock's performance also reflects these worries, with InvestingPro data showing a 42.94% price decline over the past six months. InvestingPro Tips suggest that while DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, it's trading at a high earnings multiple relative to its near-term earnings growth. This could support Wells Fargo's cautious stance on the stock's valuation. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 8 additional tips for DoubleVerify, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market performance.

Title: SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds: Small in stature, huge in performance
URL: https://www.techradar.com/gaming/steelseries-arctis-gamebuds-review
Time Published: 2024-10-29T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds are simply fantastic and raise the bar in what a pair of wireless buds can offer. Quality sound, intuitive controls, great features, and even wireless charging all combine to make an incredibly compelling package. Superb SteelSeries audio quality Ergonomic design and robust build Excellent companion app, and super multiplatform compatibility Wireless charging case is a great touch Intuitive controls but… …touchpads require a bit of force Third-party foam tips ensure a better fit Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds might be the best gaming earbuds I’ve ever tested. As an overall package they deliver on every front; from battery life to audio quality, to comfort and fit, to features. They are truly impressive and are one of the easiest recommendations I’ll ever make. Coming in chic white or slick black (depending on the platform variant you go for), each GameBud is of a compact and neat design that sits nicely in the ear, with a simple push-and-twist motion to keep them secure. They’re lightweight too, and the touchpad makes for easy control. The case is also compact and can easily slip into a pocket neatly. The GameBuds’ stature may be small, then, but they cram in a bunch of features that make the proposition incredibly compelling - before you even put them on. With active noise canceling (ANC), IP55 water-resistant rating, and multi-platform compatibility, the feature set is off to a strong start - but it gets much better. The inclusion of a quick-charge function and a wireless charging-compatible case is an excellent bonus and means you have another chance to keep your case and buds juiced for longer use, while dual 2.4Ghz and Bluetooth 5.3 offer the latest wireless connectivity. The headline feature and bonus however is, like this year’s addition to the SteelSeries headset lineup, the Arctis Nova 5 Wireless, the GameBuds work with the SteelSeries Arctis App giving you access to more than 100 expertly designed audio presets for an enormous amount of games. A good design and extensive feature set are all well and good, but it needs to be backed up with quality and excellence in gaming audio - which the GameBuds do by the bucket load. Channeling all that makes SteelSeries gaming audio gear excellent and outrageously good for all games, the GameBuds provide brilliant audio, across all genres and gameplay situations, be they quiet and tense, or busy and wild. Our testing revealed barely any weaknesses in work, play, and entertainment use, and the GameBuds are some of the finest-sounding buds I’ve used. Caveats and negatives are few and far between on the whole. You will get a better fit with third-party foam tips as the standard rubber ones provided are basic at best, and the controls do take a noticeable amount of pressure which means you will rock or push the earbud into your ear a bit every time you engage with them. However, beyond that, there’s very little to detract from the GameBuds’ performance in any way. Some competing gaming earbuds may fulfill their particular brief with more specificity - like the PlayStation Pulse Explore earbuds and their PlayStation Portal compatibility, for example - but if you’re looking for the most complete package generally, then these might just be the best gaming earbuds you can buy right now. Squarely in the same price bracket as the Sony Inzone Buds, the Razer Hammerhead HyperSpeed buds, and the PlayStation Pulse Explore buds, the GameBuds find themselves in good company. All are targeting the high-end wireless gaming earbud market, and all earn their place in it, with the GameBuds certainly doing enough to rub shoulders (or ears, I suppose) with the aforementioned sets. Already proving incredibly popular, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds have sold out on the brand’s own storefront in the pre-order phase too, and I’d expect interest to remain high after launch. Given the feature set on offer here, I think the GameBuds are priced fairly and almost aggressively; they can run a race with any other premium earbud set, and go a long way to justify the price tag. Weighing only 0.19oz / 5.3g each, it only takes a simple push and a slight twist to make them sit nicely and fit comfortably in the ear. SteelSeries says it has used scans of 40,000 ears to help shape the design of the GameBuds, though gaming earbuds will always be subject to your own unique ears. I have found them comfortable, on the whole, while also easy to interact with, and not subject to falling out of my ears easily. Much like the Pulse Explore earbuds, however, I have found in my testing that the included ear tips are bang average; serviceable at best, but not brilliant for really long sessions. I have much preferred using third-party foam tips as a solution for a better fit - and one that aids sound isolation and quality too. It's slightly disappointing that another purchase is needed to augment and really get the best out of the GameBuds’ fit. The GameBuds ditch the usual touch controls often seen on earbuds and instead, opt for something more akin to a laptop touchpad. This makes accidental inputs much harder which is welcome, but I have found that the touchpad still requires a decent push to actuate, thus slightly rocking or pushing back the earbud while it’s in your ear. It never quite feels like I’m pushing them out of position or making them loose, but it’s still not quite perfect. The 2.4Ghz wireless connectivity is not new but is excellent, and the corresponding dongle is wonderfully compact and has been designed with the PS5’s USB-C ports in mind, ensuring it doesn’t block one port while plugged into another. Teaming this with Bluetooth 5.3 rounds out a robust pairing of wireless connections. In terms of compatibility, our PlayStation unit will play nice with PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, and mobile. If you want the best level of multiplatform compatibility, however, then go for the Xbox version, which follows the modern gaming headset trend of being compatible with all major consoles and devices. The case is a small pill box, with a nice finish and compact nature, carrying the two buds and the dongle in sweetly. The ace up the sleeve of the case is the fact that it’s wireless charging compatible, however, and this is a really welcome extra feature adding a welcome level of functionality to what is otherwise just a regular charging and carrying case. Having another means of charging and potential battery life can be a critical factor for wireless gaming peripherals, and having such an extra without the need for a cable is even better. Adding this onto the claimed battery life of up to 10 hours per charge for the buds and you’ve got a robust proposition. Straight out of the box, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds have excellent sounds. Crammed into those tiny 6mm drivers is an audio soundstage that’s incredibly detailed and wonderfully vibrant up and down the spectrum. I was even nicely surprised by the amount, quality, and depth of bass. Along with the Pulse Explore earbuds (with their fancy planar magnetic drivers), these produced some of the finest gaming audio I’ve experienced in buds. From single-player games like Star Wars Outlaws and Doom (2016) to playing Diablo 4 online with a pal, the GameBuds excelled. After a while, it didn’t feel like I was receiving audio from just small earbuds, and the buds can certainly run some PS5 headsets or Xbox Series X headsets for their money on audio quality alone. This default audio quality is made better with the Arctis Companion App. Replicating its success with the Nova 5 headset, the companion app allows you to swap between expertly crafted audio presets while playing games simultaneously. These presets and this flexibility are not a gimmick, either, and you can really find EQs to suit all kinds of games that will enhance the audio experience. The ANC does kill off the bass a little as I’ve always found with it, but it’s robust enough to remain a welcome feature. As mentioned above, actually using the onboard controls walks the risky line between being good for avoiding accidental presses, while requiring a bit of force so as to move the buds a little with each push. It’s not a deal breaker and is another thing I have got used to with time but remains a slight crease in the experience. Going some way to mimic a solution that the Nova Pro Wireless offers with its infinity power system (USB-C cable charging, while its dock also charges a spare battery ready to swap in at any point), I have found the case’s wireless charging functionality to be a great boon and a fine way of extending the charge and life available to me. More broadly, in my testing, I’ve found the battery life claims SteelSeries about the buds to be true to life (around 10 hours per charge for the buds). The mic is pretty good too, for some earbuds at least. After a slight raising of the volume of the mic on PS5, my buddy reported that I didn’t sound anything majorly different from my usual headset too, and it also came across as crystal clear during work and phone calls. With such performance on offer, layered on top of the fine design, and extensive feature set, it's sufficient to say that the SteelSeries Arctis Game Buds are some of the best in the business and could be the only pair of gaming earbuds you’ll ever need. You want the best all-around gaming earbuds package going Simply put, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds do it all, and do so fantastically. From superb audio to compatibility and customizability, and from a slick design to an ingenious addition to battery life, there are barely any chinks in the GameBuds’ armor. You want some of the best sounding gaming earbuds Putting all the features and design qualities to one side, the Arctis GameBuds are simply one of the best sets of gaming earbuds when it comes to sheer audio quality. You need excellent versatility, flexibility, and customizability in your earbuds From multiplatform compatibility to choosing audio presets on the fly through the app on your phone, the options available to you with the GameBuds is superb and should be noted by anyone looking to get the most out of one set of buds. You only need cheap multiplatform compatibility via wired buds The GameBuds’ wireless multiplatform compatibility is in a wireless form which bumps up the price a bit. If you only need something cheap to go multiplatform then a wired set might be best for you. You need buds for the PlayStation Portal Despite being excellent for PlayStation consoles, the Arctis GameBuds won’t serve you by default on PlayStation Portal due to Sony owning the wireless connection to its handheld remote play device. If you’re still not sold on the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds then consider these two similar products. PlayStation Pulse Explore earbuds For users on PS5 and PlayStation Portal particularly, the Pulse Explore earbuds and their planar magnetic drivers offer some of the best gaming audio I’ve ever experienced in buds. If you value super high-quality audio quality and mainly play on PS5 and PS Portal then these are a great alternative.

Razer Hammerhead Hyperspeed earbuds Designed for Xbox, these Razer earbuds are a great option for those who prioritize Razer-grade gaming audio that emanates from sizable drivers (10mm in this case), and decent battery life.

Putting them to the test on my RTX 3090-powered gaming PC, PS5, and mobile, I used them for a whole host of functions from gaming to work meetings, from phone calls to music listening They replaced my usual earbuds, the Razer Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds when going out for walks or on the commute, and they replaced my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless on PC and PS5 for work and play. As a result, I was able to compare them directly to those headsets, as well as the PlayStation Pulse Explore earbuds that I have for use on my PS5 and PlayStation Portal. In terms of specific games, I tested the GameBuds with Frostpunk 2 on PC, and on Doom (2016), Star Wars Outlaws, Pentiment, and Diablo 4 on PS5 (the latter being an online co-op playthrough with a friend who was able to verify the quality of the mic during gameplay action).

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares mostly rise after Wall Street climbs on Big Tech gains

Rising technology stocks sent the Nasdaq composite to a record, but trading was mixed along the rest of Wall Street NEW YORK -- Rallying technology stocks sent the Nasdaq composite to a record on Tuesday, but trading was mixed along the rest of Wall Street as homebuilders and Ford Motor sank following the latest profit reports. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to inch closer to its all-time high set earlier this month, even though most of the stocks in the index fell for the day. Gains for influential Big Tech stocks helped mask weakness elsewhere, and they pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.8% to top its last all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, fell 154 points, or 0.4%. Alphabet rose 1.8% ahead of its profit report that arrived after trading ended for the day. The parent company of Google is the latest member of the group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to report its quarterly results, and each will have to deliver big growth to justify their high prices. Other market heavyweight like Microsoft and Meta Platforms were among the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 upward. They helped offset an 8.4% drop for Ford Motor, which said an underlying measure of profit for the full year will likely come in at the bottom end of its forecasted range. The automaker said stubbornly high warranty expenses and other costs are holding back its profits, though its results for the third quarter were better than analysts expected. JetBlue Airways lost 17.1% even though its results for the latest quarter were better than analysts expected. The carrier said its revenue could fall between 3% and 7% in the last three months of 2024 from a year earlier, hurt by this month’s Hurricane Milton and the upcoming U.S. presidential election. D.R. Horton tumbled 7.2% after the homebuilder reported weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Executive Chairman David Auld said some potential home buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to become more affordable and are sitting on the sidelines. All told, the S&P 500 rose 9.40 points to 5,832.92. The Dow fell 154.52 to 42,233.05, and the Nasdaq composite rose 145.56 to 18,712.75. Mortgage rates have been climbing recently because the 10-year Treasury yield has been charging higher. Yields have rallied as report after report has shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. On Tuesday, reports said confidence among U.S. consumers jumped more economists expected, while the number of job openings edged lower in September, but the number of hires remained relatively steady. Such numbers have forced traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, now that it’s just as focused on keeping the economy humming as getting inflation down. Traders are even betting on a slim chance the Fed will keep its main interest rate steady at its meeting next week, according to data from CME Group. That’s after the Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual reduction. Just a month ago, many traders were thinking just the Fed would follow up in November with another bigger-than-usual cut. Yields have also climbed as investors have seen former President Donald Trump’s chances of re-election improving. Economists say a Trump win could help push inflation higher in the long term, and worsening inflation could lead to higher interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects, climbed another 8.8% to $51.51 Tuesday. It moved so sharply during the day that trading of its stock was briefly halted several times. The parent company of Trump’s Truth Social platform has been rallying since hitting a bottom of roughly $12 in late September. Treasury yields eased a bit after paring gains from earlier in the day. The 10-year yield slipped to 4.25% from 4.28% late Monday, but it’s still well above the 3.60% level it was sitting at in the middle of last month. Treasury yields, like stocks, have historically tended to be shaky heading into an Election Day, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe after rising in much of Asia outside of a 1.1% drop for stocks in Shanghai. Crude oil prices slipped after erasing earlier gains to compound their sharp 6.1% drop from the prior day. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 0.4%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Watch These Ford Price Levels as Stock Drops After Automaker Issues Soft Outlook
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ford-price-levels-as-stock-drops-after-automaker-issues-soft-outlook-8735786

Shares in Ford (F) fell sharply in extended trading on Monday after the automaker posted third-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook amid ongoing high warranty costs, supply chain issues, and intensifying competition. CEO Jim Farley told analysts on the earnings call that the auto industry is in a global price war, driven by overcapacity and a flood of new electric vehicle (EV) companies. The Detroit-based automaker said its EV business lost $1.2 billion in the third quarter on sales of about 32,000 vehicles and booked a $1 billion charge to write down several EV-related manufacturing assets. Prior to Monday’s post-market fall, Ford shares had tumbled around 7% year-to-date Below, we break down the technicals on Ford’s weekly chart and discuss important post-earnings price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming out in early August, Ford shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle, a chart pattern that can signal a move lower if formed within an established downtrend, which is the case on the automaker’s chart. Indeed, the stock sits poised to test the pattern’s lower trendline after the company’s soft quarterly results, potentially opening the door for further post-earnings selling. The stock dropped 6% to $10.69 in after-hours trading Monday. Let’s analyze Ford’s chart to identify three key support levels that investors will likely be watching and point out a major overhead area worth monitoring. Upon a decisive breakdown below the ascending triangle, investors should monitor the $9.50 level. This location could attract buying interest near a trendline connecting a range of price action on the chart between August 2019 and this year’s early August low. A move lower could see the shares fall to around $8.70, an area where investors may seek entry points near a period of narrow consolidation in the second half of 2019, which also corresponds with the April 2021 pullback low. Ongoing selling could drive a bearish move down to the $7.50 region, where the stock would likely encounter support near the top trendline of a prior ascending triangle that formed on Ford’s chart in the months after the March 2020 pandemic low. If the stock makes a recovery, investors should keep a close eye on the $11.30 area, a level where shares may run into considerable overhead selling pressure near a trendline connecting multiple troughs dating back to January 2021. A volume-backed breakout above this major resistance could act as a catalyst for a bullish trend reversal.

Title: Jeff Bezos addresses Washington Post endorsement fiasco, cites distrust in media led to 'principled decision'
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/media/jeff-bezos-addresses-washington-post-endorsement-fiasco-cites-distrust-media-led-principled-decision
Time Published: 2024-10-29T00:17:36Z
Full Content:
‘MediaBuzz’ host Howard Kurtz reports on how The Washington Post is refraining from making a presidential endorsement for the first time in decades on ‘Special Report.’ Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos penned an op-ed defending the paper's "principled decision" in not endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. Bezos began the piece Monday by citing a Gallup poll showing Americans losing trust in the media, even falling below Congress, telling readers "Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working." "We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement," Bezos wrote. "Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility." WASHINGTON POST REPORTS LIBERALS ARE CANCELING SUBSCRIPTIONS OVER PAPER'S DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE VP HARRIS Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos defended the decision to stop presidential endorsements in an op-ed published on the paper's website. ((Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage) ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON POST OWNER JEFF BEZOS WANTS MORE CONSERVATIVE OPINION WRITERS AT PAPER: REPORT The billionaire Amazon founder, who bought The Post in 2013, insisted that newspaper endorsements "do nothing to tip the scales of an election" but instead "create a perception of bias." He doubled down on The Post's decision to end its presidential endorsements by saying it's "principled decision, and it’s the right one." "By itself, declining to endorse presidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the trust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it. That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy," Bezos conceded. Bezos denied there was any "quid pro quo" that motivated the decision and insisted the meeting the boss of his company Blue Origin had with former President Trump, which occurred the day of the announcement, was a regretful coincidence, flatly saying "There is no connection between it and our decision on presidential endorsements, and any suggestion otherwise is false." WASHINGTON POST UNION, STAFFERS REVOLT OVER DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BLAME BEZOS The Washington Post was set to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris before the move was quashed by the paper's leadership. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) He went on to suggest that his paper and other members of the legacy media are out of touch with most Americans. "The Washington Post and the New York Times win prizes, but increasingly we talk only to a certain elite. More and more, we talk to ourselves," Bezos wrote. "While I do not and will not push my personal interest, I will also not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance — overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs — not without a fight. It’s too important. The stakes are too high. Now more than ever the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice, and where better for that voice to originate than the capital city of the most important country in the world?" "To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles. Some changes will be a return to the past, and some will be new inventions. Criticism will be part and parcel of anything new, of course. This is the way of the world. None of this will be easy, but it will be worth it. I am so grateful to be part of this endeavor. Many of the finest journalists you’ll find anywhere work at The Washington Post, and they work painstakingly every day to get to the truth. They deserve to be believed," Bezos added. BEFORE NON-ENDORSEMENT DECISION, WASHINGTON POST CALLED TRUMP 'DREADFUL' AND 'WORST PRESIDENT OF MODERN TIMES' Bezos cited growing distrust in the media as the reason behind the "principled decision" for The Washington Post to end presidential endorsements. ( SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bezos' op-ed comes after The Post itself reported that the billionaire was behind the decision as the paper's CEO and publisher Will Lewis had "sought to tamp down speculation" had made the decision to help former President Trump. Meanwhile, the fallout over the decision is apparently leading The Post to pay a heavy price as NPR reported that the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper has lost more than a whopping 200,000 subscribers since Friday as liberal readers remain outraged that The Post is not endorsing Harris. Multiple members of the paper's editorial staff have also resigned. The Washington Post has been struggling the past several years. Subscriptions and revenue were in decline prior to the paper's announcement about not endorsing the presidential race, which has led to buyouts and layoffs of employees.

Title: Starbucks threatens to fire staff who don’t come back to office
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/28/starbucks-return-to-office-mandate-remote-work-from-home-fired-brian-niccol/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T23:25:41Z

Starbucks Corp. is telling its corporate staff they could be fired if they don’t come to work at the office three days a week. Starting in January, Starbucks will implement a “standardized process” to hold workers accountable if they don’t abide by the coffee chain’s return-to-office policy, according to a memo sent to one of the company’s divisions that was seen by Bloomberg News. Consequences are “up to, and including, separation,” the email said. The message marks an escalation in enforcement of the company’s hybrid work rules less than two months since Brian Niccol took over as chief executive officer. He told employees last month that they should work wherever they need to in order to get their jobs done, but that he thought that place was usually the office. Starbucks said its expectations for hybrid workers hadn’t changed and that vacation, sick time and business travel are excluded from the calculation. Workers can request an exemption from the mandate due to physical, mental, sensory impairment or another disability, the company said. The policy applies to about 3,500 corporate employees. Most of the company’s workers are employed at its stores. “We are continuing to support our leaders as they hold their teams accountable to our existing hybrid work policy,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Starbucks is the latest company to shift from carrots to sticks in the ongoing return-to-office battle that has been playing out at workplaces. Last month, Amazon.com Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy surprised employees with a memo ordering them to start reporting to their desks five days a week, beginning in January. Amazon currently lets many of them work from home two days a week. Earlier this year, Dell Technologies told workers who chose to remain remote that they wouldn’t be eligible for promotion, and Wall Street banks have also warned that working from home could jeopardize employees’ career prospects. Still, offices in the biggest US cities remain half empty compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to security firm Kastle Systems. At the same time, some firms have realized that a return-to-office mandate can serve as layoffs in disguise. In a survey from BambooHR, one in four executives admitted they hoped for some voluntary turnover in the wake of an RTO push. Research has shown, though, that the workers who quit due to the policies are often the more experienced staffers that companies can least afford to lose. Early last year, when Starbucks tried to enforce its hybrid-work mandate, dozens of corporate workers signed an open letter pushing back. Niccol’s own work arrangement, which allows him to live in California and travel 1,000 miles to Seattle on the company’s corporate jet, sparked backlash by some workers and outside critics. Starbucks has said that Niccol will spend most of his time in Seattle or visiting stores. Several staffers had said they didn’t care where the CEO was based, as long as he didn’t crack down on in-office requirements. Starbucks is also moving away from requiring Tuesday as a common attendance day for all workers at headquarters, instead setting the expectations at a team level, according to the memo. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

US stock indexes rose Monday as gains for Big Tech made up for slides in oil-and-gas stocks after the price of crude tumbled sharply. The S&P 500 rose 15.40 points, or 0.3%, to 5,823.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 273.17 points, or 0.6%, to 42,387.57. The Nasdaq composite rose 48.58 points, or 0.3%, to 18,567.19 to approach its all-time high set in July. Apple and other Big Tech stocks rose ahead of their profit reports that are scheduled to come later in the week. Oil prices tumbled more than 6% after an Israeli retaliation against Iran for earlier missile attacks proved to be more restrained than some investors had feared. Five of the behemoths known as the "Magnificent Seven" are on this week's schedule to report their latest profits, the AP reports. These high-flying stocks have been at the forefront of Wall Street for years and have grown so big that their movements can singlehandedly shift the S&P 500. After suffering a summertime swoon on worries that their stock prices had risen too quickly when compared with their profits, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon are under pressure to deliver more big growth. Another member of the Magnificent Seven, Tesla, soared to one of the best days in its history last week after reporting a better profit than analysts expected.

Title: Ford Stock Drops After Automaker Misses Profit Estimates, Trims Guidance

Time Published: 2024-10-28T20:35:00Z
Full Content:
Ford (F) reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts' expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Monday. The automaker posted third-quarter revenue of $46.2 billion, up more than 5% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. However, net income of $900 million or 22 cents per share declined from the $1.2 billion or 30 cents per share Ford posted a year earlier, missing estimates. Ford said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings of about $10 billion, compared to its previous estimate of $10 billion to $12 billion. The results come after Ford's second-quarter earnings missed Street estimates and analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock last month citing increased competition from China, weighing on Ford's stock price. Shares of Ford fell over 4% in extended trading following the release. They were down about 7% for the year through Monday's close.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Eli Lilly's Earnings Wednesday

Time Published: 2024-10-28T20:29:09Z
Full Content:
As pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY) plans to report third-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, analysts are focused on the production and sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound—two popular weight-loss drugs that have boosted the company's results. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect a 28% year-over-year revenue jump to $12.2 billion. Eli Lilly is projected to swing to $1.7 billion in net income from a $57.4 million net loss last year, when it reported a charge of nearly $3 billion related to "in progress research and development" (IPR&D) as it closed a number of acquisitions. Ahead of Wednesday's earnings announcement, Eli Lilly said it expects to report an IPR&D charge of about $2.83 billion for the quarter, well above the $154 million and $111 million, respectively, the company reported for the first two quarters of the year. In each of its first two quarters this year, Eli Lilly lifted its full-year outlook on the strength of sales for its weight loss drugs. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote last week that they believe the drugmaker will affirm its outlook rather than raise it again. The analysts cited a shifting production environment for Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs, and said sales may have slowed in parts of the U.S. because of the impact of Hurricane Helene on some pharmacies in the Southeast U.S in the quarter. The company's weight loss drugs were dropped from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) shortage list during the quarter, as the agency currently notes the shortage of Mounjaro and Zepbound's active ingredient tirzepatide as "resolved." Both Eli Lilly and Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NVO) have seen their sales surge over the last several quarters as demand has spiked for their weight loss drugs, with each company spending billions to increase production to meet demand. Eli Lilly said in its second quarter earnings call that its supply of the drugs should improve through the back half of 2024, but said it could still face "periodic supply tightness" as demand remained high. The company also launched a lower-cost and easier-to-produce version of Zepbound in the quarter. Eli Lilly shares edged higher Monday, finishing just under $896. The stock is up more than 50% this year.

The Future Of Work Is At A “Stall Or Soar” Decision Point As 2025 approaches, businesses stand at a critical crossroads: Will they soar to new heights by embracing the future of work or stall in the face of emerging challenges? The last few years have been a roller-coaster ride, with a turbulent ascent into a seemingly bright future of work only to take a deep dive into the icy waters of layoffs, burnout, and disillusionment. And just when many thought the bottom had dropped out, we’re seeing faint signs of recovery — a bounce that will either propel companies forward or drag them further down. The fate of your organization depends on how you handle the critical choices coming your way. We predict big risks and opportunities for the future of working including: Whether our predictions for 2025 come true for you is up to you. As we saw in 2024, even as the EX winter got colder, companies that zigged while the rest zagged emerged far ahead of their counterparts. We know one financial services company that has the highest employee satisfaction scores it has ever seen, despite the general chilly work climate, because it invested in employees and addressed organizational concerns. Conversely, we’re working with many firms — in media, consumer products, and more — who are dealing with stagnant work cultures, general distrust in executives, and lower confidence in organizational strategy due to letting EX slide for the past year. That’s why we say that the future of work doesn’t have to be your future of work. Whether you stall or soar is up to you.

Title: Should You Pick Caterpillar Stock Ahead Of Q3?

Close-up of CAT (Caterpillar Inc) logo on construction equipment, Lafayette, California, August 20, ... [+] 2024. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) will report its Q3 2024 results on Wednesday, October 30. We expect the company’s revenues to come in at $16.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.36 per share, broadly aligning with the consensus estimates. The company should see a decline in sales amid lower dealer inventory levels and overall weakness in demand. Our interactive dashboard analysis of Caterpillar’s FY 2024Q3 Earnings Preview has more details on the company’s revenues and earnings for the quarter. Caterpillar will have a tough comparison with the prior-year-quarter, which benefited from strong pricing growth and a robust demand environment. Pricing growth is expected to moderate in the near term. Caterpillar expects a slight decline in dealer inventory levels in 2024, compared to a $700 million rise in 2023, and this may have pulled its sales down in Q3. We forecast sales of around $16.1 billion, reflecting a 4% y-o-y decline. We don’t expect any meaningful improvement in operating margin, and its earnings to fall in the low single-digits y-o-y to $5.36 per share in Q3. Caterpillar’s revenue of $16.7 billion in Q2 was down 4% y-o-y. Looking at segments, the Construction Industries revenue was down 7%, Resource Industries sales were down 10%, while Energy & Transportation revenue was up 2%. Caterpillar saw its adjusted operating margin expand by 110 bps to 22.4% in Q2’24. The company’s bottom line stood at $5.99, compared to $5.55 in the prior-year quarter. We think CAT stock is appropriately priced. We estimate Caterpillar’s valuation to be $357 per share, slightly lower than its current market price of around $385. Our forecast is based on a little over 16x P/E multiple for CAT and expected earnings of $22.14 on a per-share and adjusted basis for the full year 2024. The 16x P/E multiple aligns with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years. Despite the company facing headwinds, CAT stock has outperformed the broader markets, with 33% gains this year, vis-à-vis a 22% rise for the S&P 500 index. This can partly be attributed to the company’s upbeat earnings reported in Q1 and Q2. Notably, CAT is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last three years. Still, that wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the CAT stock were 16% in 2021, 19% in 2022, and 26% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While CAT stock appears fully valued, it is helpful to see how Caterpillar’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: It's a make-or-break week for the stock market
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-tech-earnings-gdp-inflation-jobs-report-economy-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-28T17:21:29Z
Full Content:
Traders are bracing themselves for a big week for the stock market. Investors will be watching key data releases — including third-quarter GDP, an inflation update from the personal consumption expenditures index, and the October jobs report — for clues about the state of the economy heading into the end of the year. The data points will be key inputs for the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts. If the economy stays hot, the Fed could slow or even pause its easing cycle and spark a recalibration in markets that causes fresh volatility for stocks. Meanwhile, five mega-cap tech firms worth a combined $12 trillion — Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet — are set to report third-quarter earnings this week. Here are the key inputs for markets to keep an eye on this week. Earnings season is peaking this week. More than 90 S&P 500 companies are set to report, including the mega-cap giants Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. Together, those five companies are worth about $12 trillion. Investors will be looking for signs of AI growth — and with it, signals that the tech bull run will continue into 2025. Alphabet reports on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta on Wednesday. For Meta, analysts expect to see strong growth and a stable core business. In a note last week, analysts at Bernstein described Meta as the new "set it and forget it" blue-chip stock. They raised their price target to $675 a share from $600, representing potential upside of 16% from the price of the stock at midday on Monday. Apple has an especially big week ahead. The iPhone maker reports on Thursday and is expected to unveil software and hardware updates this week, including access to highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features with the iOS 18.1 update. In a note last Wednesday, the supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities warned of weak demand for Apple's iPhone 16 models and argued there was no sign that Apple's coming AI capabilities had boosted demand for its devices. Amazon will also report on Thursday. Deutsche Bank analysts expect strong results driven by operating income at the high end of guidance and higher operating income for next year. The analysts see several sources of upside, including faster growth of total ad revenue in its Prime Video segment; lower operating expenses for Amazon Web Services; and slow growth of other operating expenses. Investors will also be watching for clues about the strength of the AI trade. Except for Apple, the tech giants reporting this week are among Nvidia's biggest customers. As Nvidia's earnings aren't for another month, the third-quarter results and executive commentary will be gauges of demand from the so-called hyperscalers driving the bulk of GPU sales. The Wedbush Securities analyst and tech bull Dan Ives described this week as the "world series for big tech." He predicted that earnings results would come in strong and send tech stocks higher into the end of the year. "Investors need to see the monetization of AI spreading to the rest of the tech landscape and the next few weeks will be the linchpin to confirmation that the AI 'use case phase' have now begun within the enterprise world," Ives wrote in a note on Sunday. The flurry of key data releases starts with third-quarter GDP on Wednesday. Last week, stocks took a hit as the bond market sold off based on expectations for interest rates to remain higher; cautious comments from Fed officials; and rising odds of another Donald Trump presidency, which is widely seen as an inflationary event given his promises of high tariffs. Depending on the data this week, the bond market could reprice and send shocks through the stock market as investors adjust rate expectations. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker on Friday showed an expectation of 3.3% economic growth for the quarter. That would mark significant growth from last quarter's 3% growth. A hot economy is a hurdle to aggressive rate cuts from the Fed and could cause markets to reprice expectations for interest rates through the rest of this year and into 2025. Personal consumption expenditures, due Thursday, will be another input for the Fed as it nears its goal of 2% inflation. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge is expected to show that prices rose by 2.1% year over year in September after coming in at 2.2% in August. After a blockbuster September jobs report, the stakes are high for October's jobs data on Friday. The data has become a double-edged sword for the market. If job growth remains high, that could reduce the need for more rate cuts. If the data is weaker than expected, that could prompt more rapid easing but also hint at a weakening economy. Economists expect to see that 110,000 jobs were added in the month, far fewer than the 254,000 added in September. JPMorgan analysts forecast a slightly milder increase of 100,000. They said recent storms and strikes could weigh on job growth, making the report difficult to interpret. "A decline in the unemployment rate would likely increase chatter around a Fed 'skip' in November, but barring an unexpectedly and remarkably strong set of data next week, we think it would take more months of good data before that possibility gets onto the Fed's radar," the analysts said in a note. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets expect the Fed to deliver 25-basis-point cuts at the November and December meetings. Correction: October 28, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of jobs the US added in September. It was 254,000, not 245,000. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) will report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, in what will serve as a temperature check on the health of the artificial intelligence market. AI continues to drive shares of tech giants ranging from AMD rival Nvidia (NVDA) to customers like Microsoft (MSFT), and investors and analysts are hoping to see their big bets pay off. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. Shares of the chip company are up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. For the quarter, AMD is expected to bring in adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. That’s up from $0.70 per share and $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — is set to bring in $3.46 billion, up from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. Analysts are expecting $1.39 billion from its AI/GPU revenue alone. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, is set to bring in $1.71 billion, versus $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, is projected to drop in a big way. Analysts anticipate the business will bring in $572 million in the quarter. That’s nearly a $1 billion decline from the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches. AMD’s earnings report will give investors and analysts a look at what to expect from Nvidia when it announces its own earnings on Nov. 20. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Dustin Kjersem was found dead in his tent about two and a half miles up Moose Creek Road on Saturday, Oct. 12.

"In addition to the information previously provided, we are asking you to be on the lookout for the following items that are believed to have been removed from the scene of the crime," the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office wrote in a recent press release, listing an Estwing camp axe, blue and silver, likely with a 26-inch handle; a Remington Model 11-87 12-gauge shotgun, wood stock; a Ruger Blackhawk .44 Magnum revolver, blued 4 5/8-inch barrel, wood grips; and an orange YETI Tundra 45 cooler.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Bloomberg Reportedly Gives Another $50 Million To Help Harris (Updated)
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/28/kamala-harris-has-more-billionaires-prominently-backing-her-than-trump-bloomberg-reportedly-gives-another-50-million-to-help-harris-updated/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T16:46:13Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 83 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): In a strongly worded editorial in the Bezos-owned Washington Post, the centibillionaire explained his decision to reportedly strike down the newspaper’s endorsement of Harris amid a storm of controversy, explaining he believed it would help restore the public’s faith in the paper’s journalism. “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” wrote Bezos. Ken Griffin: Griffin (Citadel) confirmed he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): Griffin, one of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in the world and one of the deepest-pocketed Republican donors in prior election years, told Bloomberg financial markets’ “expectation today is that Donald Trump will win the White House,” echoing a chorus of Wall Street money flows seemingly pricing in such a scenario. But regardless of who wins, “the reduction of uncertainty is almost positive for asset prices and we’re at that moment of peak uncertainty,” offering a positive prognostication for investors. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison: Ellison is one of the most surprising billionaires who has stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering he has donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), in the primaries. A total of 83 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: The news outlet Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. (Updated Oct. 28): Bloomberg donated another $50 million to the same non-profit organization backing Harris, the Times reported Monday. Bloomberg was already the most prolific individual donor to Harris groups this cycle, and his total financial commitment toward Democratic causes now reportedly approaches nearly $100 million. Also, Duolingo founder Luis von Ahn endorsed Harris, declaring the Democratic candidate is “the better option for the US economy.” (Updated Oct. 30): Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former Republican governor of California, said he will vote for the Harris/Walz ticket in a lengthy social media post. Noting he has “plenty of disagreements” with Harris’ platform, Schwarzenegger slammed fellow celebrity-turned-politican Trump as “un-American,” declaring another Trump presidency would bring “four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.” A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Tesla short sellers lose more than $4 billion on EV maker's post-earnings stock rally

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla's (TSLA) post-earnings stock rally has cost short sellers billions. Tesla short sellers lost $4.2 billion in the two days following the EV maker’s third quarter earnings last Wednesday, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla reported a higher-than-expected third quarter profit and improved margins after the bell on Oct. 23. Those beats helped Tesla stock notch its biggest single-day gain in a decade. The stock jumped 22% last Thursday, its best day since 2013, and shares rose another 3.3% Friday. Tesla stock was up roughly 1% on Monday before reversing direction, ending the day down 2.5%. This isn’t the first time this year that short sellers paid dearly for betting against the Elon Musk-helmed company. In the week following Tesla’s better-than-feared fiscal first quarter earnings report in April, short sellers lost more than $5 billion. Tesla’s stock performance has been volatile over the past month. Shares sank in early October as the automaker missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. Then, the stock rose in anticipation of Tesla’s robotaxi unveiling, only to fall sharply when the event failed to live up to the hype. Tesla’s most recent rally last week comes despite mixed third quarter results. While Tesla beat Wall Street’s forecasts on its adjusted earnings per share and gross margin, its quarterly revenue of $25.18 billion was lower than the $25.4 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. A slew of Wall Street analysts from Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Deustche Bank (DB) to Wedbush, Canaccord Genuity, and William Blair have reiterated their Buy ratings on Tesla stock following the report. Bank of America also raised its price target on the stock to $265 from $255. The firm's senior auto analyst John Murphy said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above) he is eyeing another price target hike on Tesla. While Tesla’s recent focus on its AI ambitions had left investors feeling skittish, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he was encouraged by Tesla's emphasis in its third quarter earnings call on revving up its auto business, which accounts for 80% of Tesla's revenue. Jonas pointed to CEO Elon Musk's comments about targeting 20% to 30% growth in electric vehicle deliveries in 2025 while focusing on lowering production costs. "As investors struggle with the business model shift from auto to AI, this print reminds us growing the auto business profitably remains a high priority," Jonas wrote in a note to investors. Meanwhile, 20 of the 60 analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg have a Hold rating on the stock and 15 analysts recommend selling shares. On average, they see shares falling to $228 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

October 28, 2024 12:15 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on November 01, 2024 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective November 04, 2024: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty-five shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately twenty-five-times higher for the Fund. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on November 04, 2024. The next day’s opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for- twenty-five reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-25 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. All GraniteShares leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares current ETF offering is presented below: Gregory FCA for GraniteSharesKathleen Elicker, 484-889-6597graniteshares@gregoryfca.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747 or visit www.graniteshares.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

October 28, 2024 12:15 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on November 01, 2024 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective November 04, 2024: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty-five shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately twenty-five-times higher for the Fund. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on November 04, 2024. The next day’s opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for- twenty-five reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-25 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Transfer rankings go out the door once everyone steps onto campus, but it's clear as day that the hits (and misses) from the bonkers 2024 portal cycle will make or break numerous clubs that have championship expectations. Let's dive into 100 and 1 transfers to know this season. Factors like talent (duh), fit into the new roster and the scheme that they will be playing were heavily weighed. Transfer from: Seton Hall Richmond might never be a knockdown catch-and-shoot sniper, but his positional size is a cheat card on both ends of the floor. St. John's has the bones of an excellent defensive club with Richmond's nastiness and versatility at the forefront. Richmond, a 6-foot-6, 205-pound bowling ball, put up enormous numbers (15.7 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 5.1 apg) in a slow-paced, Seton Hall system last season. Rick Pitino is going to ramp up the tempo to lightning-strike levels, so Richmond is in an eruption spot. Transfer from: Florida Atlantic From Derrick Rose to Rob Dillingham and numerous ballers in between, John Calipari annually hands the keys to a lead guard and lets 'em cook. That formula won't change in Arkansas. Davis is poised to be the Razorbacks' new alpha. The Florida Atlantic transfer is armed to score with every tool in the shed. Ball screens, post-ups, transition, drives or handoffs? You name it, Davis can get buckets with it. Transfer from: Drake The 6-7, 210-pound forward is an elite three-level scorer. DeVries is truly a big guard. He makes high-difficulty shots look way too easy from the midrange and downtown. DeVries' off-movement shooting sets up everything about his game. He's so big and can create space so effortlessly. But he can also use his frame as a bootyball weapon in post-ups. He didn't get to the rim a ton, but he shot over 67% when he got there. DeVries is just an all-around star who passes it well, rebounds well, plays defense and gets to the free throw line religiously. He was a star for his dad, Darian, at Drake. He'll be a star for his dad at West Virginia. Transfer from: Wisconsin Storr would carry Wisconsin and occasionally, shoot the Badgers out of games. He'd terrify both coaching staffs. But his strengths are so obvious. The big, explosive wing is a brutally tough cover when he gets the rock on an empty side, rips it and gets downhill. Storr can put anybody on a poster, even Mount Edey. Storr has the most juice of anybody in Kansas' wing corps. If Storr embraces cutting with a purpose, Bill Self could spoon-feed him four points a game with brilliant halfcourt sets. If he embraces running the floor hard in transition, that's another easy six points a game with Dajuan Harris or Hunter Dickinson whipping bullet, look-ahead passes. Storr could saunter to 20-point nights in this scheme without breaking a sweat. If it coalesces properly, Storr could be Kansas' best player and an All-American candidate. Transfer from: Duke Roach-to-Baylor is one of the rare high-floor, high-ceiling additions in the 2024 portal cycle. The Duke transfer will waltz into Baylor's starting lineup and give Scott Drew a veteran who has played a variety of roles over the years. He can be a go-to scorer. He can be an initiating point guard. He can be a spot-up shooter. Baylor is also getting the best version of Roach. He shot 43% from 3-point range, 40% on midrange jumpers and 56% at the rim last season. Baylor can lean on Roach to go create a bucket for himself or others in late-clock situations. Maybe most importantly, Roach doesn't block any of Baylor's talented freshmen. If intriguing freshman point guard Rob Wright III is ready to go, Roach can slide to an off-ball role. If five-star VJ Edgecombe is ready to be a freshman sensation, Roach can shift to a secondary role, but Roach is a sleeper Big 12 Player of the Year candidate in this scheme. Transfer from: Indiana State Few bigs are as skilled as Avila. The former Indiana State star smartly stuck with his guy, Josh Schertz, who took the Saint Louis job. Schertz helped turn Avila into a star, and the duo should be up to their old tricks again in the Atlantic 10. Avila has established himself as one of the best small-ball bigs in the country. His skill is off the charts, both as a passer, low-post threat and a true floor-stretching big man. Saint Louis smartly added athletic forwards like Kalu Anya and AJ Casey to cover up some of Avila's deficiencies on the defensive end. He's not a shot-blocker, but Avila is a cheat code offensively, so that makes up for it. Cue the Cream Abdul-Jabbar or Larry Nerd jokes. Transfer from: Miami Playing with a ridiculous motor can make up for a lot. Omier, a 6-7, 240-pound forward, doesn't have elite height, but he plays so hard. Omier has turned himself into one of the best players in the country. Omier eats rebounds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He will sprint the floor whether he's getting the ball or not. He sets good screens and plays with toughness and physicality. The little stuff is a constant. The intangibles are glorious. But Omier added an extra layer to his game with his 3-ball. Omier shot 35% on 68 attempts from downtown last season. Omier at the 5 will be a cheat code for a Baylor offense that didn't need much help. Five-shooter lineups will be a staple and the paint will be cleared for Baylor's guards to get to the tin. Baylor's offense has been awesome without a five-out option. Now it has one. Look out. Transfer from: Illinois Kansas State paid up to win the Coleman Hawkins sweepstakes, and Jerome Tang's next priority is getting the Dug McDaniel-Hawkins, pick-and-pop game humming right away. McDaniels' speed and Hawkins' deep range should open the floor up for Kansas State's offense, but Hawkins, the creator, might be more important than Hawkins, the shooter. His ability to carve up defenses as a passer and a handler will be a wrinkle that few other big men possess. Tang is also one of the best defensive coaches in the sport, and a now-healthy Hawkins gives Tang so much lineup versatility because he can switch onto guards and pester big wings. Hawkins has some of the best hands in the country. He should be a deflection machine for a K-State defense that usually wants to take the ball away. Transfer from: Utah State Danny Sprinkle is bringing Osobor with him again to a new job. This time with way more fanfare and a whole lot more NIL money. Osobor is one of the best small-ball centers in the portal who may have to downshift to the 4 if Franck Kepnang can ever get healthy. You would feel that duo. Osobor can play with anybody thanks to his rim pressure and playmaking. He flirted with some triple-doubles last season at Utah State, and Washington will need him to make great decisions if it wants to compete in a gauntlet of a Big Ten. There's optimism that Osobor can expand his jumper out to the perimeter but that hasn't happened yet. He's a career 64% free throw shooter. Sprinkle would be overjoyed if he can crack the 70% range because he could lead the Big Ten in free throw attempts next season. Transfer from: Washington State Indiana's pitiful pick-and-roll offense needed a life raft, and Rice will team up with Stanford transfer Kanaan Carlyle to be the solution. The vibrant point guard waltzes into a new-look backcourt with a real chance to be The Man. Rice is a jitterbug with the ball in his hands. An explosive first step helps Rice navigate into the paint left and right. Washington State played two non-shooting bigs so often last season, so IU's crowded paint won't be anything new to Rice. He's a capable shooter but he wasn't efficient last season because he was often Washington State's late-clock, bail-out guy. He makes up for it with a barrage of finishes and proficient reads in the ball-screen game. Rice is also an awesome point-of-attack defender who more than held his own for a Washington State defense that finished second in the Pac-12 in league play. Rice, simply, refuses to get screened. That's a skill. Rice can be a first-team, All-Big Ten player next season. Transfer from: Tennessee Aidoo was one of the few no-brainers in the portal. Aidoo is a plug-and-play big man who can do it all. He can protect the rim, uncork soft-touch jumpers, post up, run the floor, pass a little bit and convert his free throws. There's just so much to like about his game, and the table is set for Aidoo to be a top-two option at Arkansas. He'll be the outlet for Arkansas' electric backcourt. If his engine is revving non-stop, Aidoo can be one of the best big men in the country. Transfer from: Rutgers Alabama's rim defense went from a major strength in 2022-23 to a major weakness last season. Omoruyi's presence should single-handedly make Alabama a vicious rim defense again. The Rutgers transfer is an excellent drop-coverage defender who has an insane wingspan that he uses on both ends. The offensive ecosystem at Alabama is so much better than it was last season at Rutgers. Omoruyi as a legit lob threat who can loom in the dunker spot will be more effective than heavy post-up reps. Omoruyi is also one of the best raw athletes in the country. His dunks will shake the rim for days. Transfer from: USC Johnson is expected to be a massive piece of this UCLA team. He's one of the best all-around defenders in the country, and under Mick Cronin's guidance, he could transform into a Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year frontrunner. Playing with a point guard like Isaiah Collier was supposed to help Johnson's offensive game, but he regressed big-time as a shooter. There's still plenty of reason for cautious optimism of a bounceback in that regard. Johnson's slashing and defense give him such a high floor. He doesn't have to be a star for the Bruins, but fresh scenery could unlock his full bag. Johnson-to-UCLA is pound-for-pound as good a fit as anyone in the portal. Transfer from: Duke Mitchell was a piece for Duke, but he will be the piece for Mizzou. It's an excellent bet by both sides. Mitchell could give Dennis Gates a Kobe Brown-like, jumbo initiator who can be the centerpiece of an offense. His drives can be nasty, especially when an opposing center is guarding him. A top dawg role at Missouri should help him play with more confidence and assertiveness, two attributes that started to dissipate at Duke down the stretch. Mitchell can be a terrific two-way piece for the Tigers, and he's positioned to put up career-best numbers in his new home. Transfer from: BYU A hint of familiarity is just so huge for a new coach. Robinson had a breakout season under Mark Pope at BYU, and he smartly chose to run it back. This time he'll don the Kentucky threads. Robinson demands so much attention because he's a legit 6-7 shooter who never stops moving and can elevate over just about every defender. Robinson was also one of the top transition scorers in college basketball last season, despite only shooting 28% on his transition 3s. Some positive regression is coming in that department. As he continues to grow as an on-ball creator, Robinson's game will reach new heights. But he's a darn good college basketball player right now and could lead the SEC in 3-point shooting. .@Robinsonjaxx starting off HOT 🔥🥵19 PTS (7-12 FG, 5-9 3FG) | 3 REB pic.twitter.com/5l5Z9dGPFn Transfer from: Saint Mary's Mahaney is the only player on this UConn roster who has been the No. 1 option on the scouting report in college. That'll be invaluable. The 6-foot-3 junior guard has all the qualities that Hurley wants. He's tough. He's a winner. He's reliable. He's smart. Oh, and he can shoot it. Mahaney shot 38% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers as a sophomore and 46% as a freshman. Per Synergy, no high-major team generated a higher percentage of open catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season than … UConn. Mahaney should fit like a glove in this backcourt, and he's a killer in late-clock scenarios. UConn should maximize his strengths and cover up the warts in his game. Transfer from: East Carolina Small and DeVries give West Virginia a 1-2 punch that can play with anybody. Small was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the portal, but playing next to a stud scorer like DeVries should open up more spot-up opportunities for Small. That should be money in the bank. Small was a bad catch-and-shoot weapon at East Carolina, but he worked tirelessly to make it a strength. He splashed 47% of his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Oklahoma State. Small was a good No. 1 option for Oklahoma State last season. He should be a great No. 2 option for WVU in 2024-25. Transfer from: Indiana State Xavier scored the fifth-most points off handoffs last season, per Synergy. It added one of the best shooters in the portal who excelled on … handoffs. Only 15 players in the country made more 3-pointers off handoffs than Conwell last season. Conwell's shot profile is all 3-pointers or stuff at the rim. Conwell splashed over 42% of his catch-and-shoot triples and also shot over 62% at the rim. He was one of the best shooting guards in the country last season, and he's going to a scheme that excels at letting snipers cook. Conwell only has one season under his belt where he was a plus-shooter, but if that sticks (as expected), he can be one of the best players in the Big East. Transfer from: FAU New Michigan coach Dusty May did not get his entire FAU band to follow him to Michigan, but he did land maybe the most important one. Goldin can be one of the Big Ten's best big men next season. He's a complete load in the paint, but his improved mobility and touch around the basket has helped him become a much better target in the ball-screen game. Goldin isn't super fluid but he's so powerful. When he stays under control, he's a monster. Goldin is not some Nikola Jokic-like distributor, but he'll make the simple reads if he's doubled or on the short roll. He has real high-major size, so Michigan can play him one-on-one against just about anybody defensively. Goldin should be highly productive at Michigan. Transfer from: Arizona Indiana's rebounding was not a strength last season, but Ballo can single-handedly raise that floor significantly. The 7-foot, 260-pound center is impossible to move, and he's become one of the best rebounders in the sport, period. Ballo is an outstanding play-finisher in pick-and-rolls and should set bone-crushing screens for IU's ball-handlers. Ballo will seal his man and finish in the paint efficiently with post-ups. He also offers a solid interior defense. Arizona's top-10 defense was fantastic with Ballo on the floor, but he's pretty much limited to just drop coverage and teams will try to exploit that. Big men like Ballo are usually a cheat code for regular-season success, but he needs to get fully healthy. THE POWER. 😤@OumarBallo32 | #IUBB pic.twitter.com/oRjMj5nEgH Transfer from: Michigan No one scored more points in pick-and-rolls last season than McDaniel. Now, he's headed to the Octagon of Doom where short kings like Markquis Nowell (and Tylor Perry to a lesser extent) have put up numbers. McDaniel has legit defensive questions, but he's such a tough cover due to his speed, deep jumper and nifty floater. Kansas State's funkily-built roster is dependent on McDaniel being a superstar. His usage rate should be ridiculously high. He will put up numbers. Will it impact winning? Transfer from: Utah Smith's speed, competitiveness, defense and court vision should be everything Pitino craves from his point guards. The fit between Richmond and Smith has been questioned from the start. Both high-usage guards aren't high-volume, 3-point shooters. But Richmond is more of a halfcourt hub and Smith is awesome in transition. That push-pull should add some diversity to St. John's profile. Smith's ability to bend defenses and create long closeouts for Richmond to attack is the way for this duo to thrive together. Transfer from: Virginia Tech Pedulla is just an all-around great player. The 6-1 guard is a flamethrower shooter who gets to the free-throw line and is very unselfish. His efficiency numbers might have been better without numerous late-clock heaves that litter his Virginia Tech tape, but Pedulla is a real three-level scorer. He quickly assimilated to various roles at Virginia Tech, and that should pop up in a more-talented Ole Miss roster. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to score, he will. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to be a pass-first guy on some night, he'll do that, too. Pedulla's ability to play on or off the ball gives Chris Beard real flexibility with his lineup construction blueprints. Transfer from: New Mexico Texas Tech is a haven for former Mountain West Freshman of the Year winners. Last season, it was Darrion Williams. This year, it's Toppin. The 6-foot-9, 210-pound big man should slot in as Texas Tech's starting 4-man, and he can be one of the most impactful defenders on the roster. Toppin can slide those puppies on the perimeter while offering legitimate rim protection. Toppin was a stocks (steals and blocks) machine last season at New Mexico, and he's a junkyard dawg on the glass. Toppin has to grow as a shooter, both from downtown and from the free throw line, but Elijah Hawkins should generate so many open looks for Toppin to eat around the rim. Transfer from: Xavier Claude is the best addition for new USC coach Eric Musselman. The 6-foot-6, 207-pound guard will be the No. 1 option for this Trojans' club. Claude will be an impact defender from the jump, but USC will rely on him to be a late-game closer, too. Claude has outstanding positional size, and Xavier put him in a ton of ball screens. Expect more of the same at USC. Claude should take another step as a shooter which could help him become a true three-level scorer. If that happens, he can be one of the best players in the Big Ten. Don't be stunned if he flirts with some triple-doubles eventually. Jumbo-sized initiators have thrived under Musselman in the past. Claude is up next. Transfer from: South Florida The fifth-year senior is an utter deadeye on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. Youngblood drained 40% of his treys for three straight years. Why would that change next year in one of the best offensive systems in the country? But Youngblood shouldn't be painted as just a specialist. The South Florida transfer was well-coached into a well-rounded hooper. He's a broad-shouldered, thick veteran who isn't afraid to post up against smaller guards and rack up fouls. It's a good strategy when you're a career 82% free throw shooter. His pull-up jumper is so, so silky. Youngblood-to-Alabama is one of the best fits in the transfer portal. Transfer from: Harvard Mack is a shifty point guard who can break down defenses left and right and uncork two-handed, frozen ropes or one-handed, live-dribble whips to shooters. The sophomore's playmaking is why he's the jewel of this Georgetown transfer haul. Mack has all the physical tools to be one of the better point guards in the Big East. Transfer from: North Florida Lanier was one of the coveted guards in this transfer cycle because of his silky-smooth jumper that he can get to off the catch or off the bounce. His mechanics are a little funky. Sometimes his knees nearly touch the basketball on his gather and load, but he's able to get it off. Tennessee will likely play him off the ball and run him off a ton of floppy actions for 3-pointers, similar to what it did with Dalton Knecht. Tennessee's horde of nasty defenders should cover up some of Lanier's perceived deficiencies on that end. Transfer from: Oklahoma Uzan is a plug-and-play starting point guard for Kelvin Sampson who will provide an outstanding feel for the game and get the ball where it needs to go. Uzan finished with a two-to-one, assist-to-turnover ratio last season, but it can be way better at Houston. Uzan has loads of outstanding play-finishers that he can find along with two absolute net-shredders like LJ Cryer and Emanuel Sharp to keep the floor spaced properly. Uzan can manipulate the defense and find cutters or shooters at the very last second, and he's a willing, active defender. The jumper will be the swing skill set. Uzan can shoot it. He proved that as a freshman when he shot over 38% from downtown in Big 12 play. But he regressed last season. If he can get back to the mid-to-high 30s to go along with his fabulous floater, terrific court-mapping and well-rounded defense, Uzan can be a massive piece for a Houston club that has its sights set on a national championship run. Transfer from: Belmont Tyson was such a necessary addition to a UNC offense that so badly needed a big, rangy shooter. Tyson does not create much offense for himself off the bounce, but that could be another wrinkle to add to his game this offseason. Being able to attack smaller matchups with post-ups (similar to what Harrison Ingram did) would be a huge boost for Tyson's NBA stock. At minimum, Tyson is a plug-and-play sniper who was efficient from downtown, the midrange and at the rim, but Tyson is far from a finished product. Transfer from: James Madison Edwards should make everything easier for Louisville's rebuild. The James Madison veteran transfer is a true two-way player who was asked to do a little bit of everything. Edwards owned one of the highest pick-and-roll usages last season, and he's got lots of counters in his bag. He owns a tight spin move to get to the rim or to his soft-touch floater. Edwards has grown a ton as a shooter, but he's still at his best when he hits attack mode and seeks out the creases. Edwards is slated to earn a heavy usage rate when he's on the floor, and Louisville's decision to load up on big men who can stretch the floor should open the paint for Edwards' defense-bending drives. Transfer from: Ohio State Gayle has a real shot at being the jewel of Michigan's transfer haul. Gayle has all the qualities of a pass-dribble-shoot guard who also happens to be hellacious defensively. Being able to attack space off the bounce is essential in May's drive-and-kick offense. Gayle does all of that. He shot over 60% at the rim on enormous volume. Nearly 43% of Gayle's shot attempts were at the rim last season. He is a walking paint touch, and Gayle should continue to be a staple at the free throw line. Gayle's 3-point jumper is streaky and the mechanics are a bit iffy at times. But it's not unsolvable. There's All-Big Ten upside here one day with room for even more. 🪣🪣 pic.twitter.com/5L00SQVAnV Transfer from: Arizona Boswell, a Champaign native, is coming home to adopt the biggest role of his career. Boswell had an 18% usage rate last season at Arizona. He could sniff the 25% range at Illinois. Underwood pitched Boswell on an expanded offensive role, but Illinois certainly needs Boswell to buff up its perimeter defense. When dialed in, Boswell can be a difference-maker at the point of attack. Illinois landed prized international freshman Kasparas Jakucionis to handle most of the true point guard reps, which should allow Boswell to slide into a score-first, off-ball role. Boswell is a knockdown 3-point sniper, but he did not get to the rim often last season and barely shot any free throws. Attacking the rim is a massive priority for Underwood. It has to be a point of emphasis for Boswell. Transfer from: Alabama Griffen shot over 39% on 146 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Alabama. He's exactly the type of sidekick this Kansas roster needed to accentuate Hunter Dickinson and Dajuan Harris. But he's so much more than just a shooter. Griffen is a comfortable secondary handler who flashed pockets of nifty decision-making. Griffen could be an elite 3-and-D wing once the D catches up to the 3-point shooting. He's shown flashes on that end, but it's time to level up. Kansas is banking on it. Transfer from: Oklahoma McCollum is a stud. He was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the country last season for an undermanned Oklahoma club. McCollum is so dynamic off the bounce, and he can operate as Georgia Tech's lead guard or as a spot-up assassin next to emerging sophomore Nait George. McCollum's 31% 3-point mark is a bit deceiving. McCollum often had to operate as Oklahoma's late-clock, bail-us-out option. He shot just 4-for-24 on 3-pointers with less than four seconds left on the shot clock. McCollum can be one of the best offensive guards in the ACC with a few subtle tweaks in his game. Transfer from: Texas Tech Greg McDermott has a long history of maximizing his best offensive players. Isaacs should be up next to jump on Creighton's jetpack joy ride. Isaacs' jumper last season was hit-or-miss, partially due to a hip injury and some iffy shot selection. But he's fearless and hard to contain off the bounce. Isaacs shot just 43% at the rim as a freshman, but that improved slightly to 48% last season. Is another spike coming? Isaacs will be Creighton's best late-clock option and his pick-and-roll chemistry with Kalkbrenner should be on full display. Isaacs is an easy pick to lead this Bluejays team in scoring. Transfer from: Oregon State Bilodeau is a huge get for a UCLA offense that needed fixin' in the worst way. UCLA was one of the worst layup-shooting teams in the country last season. Bilodeau was automatic around the rim. He finished with the sixth-highest offensive efficiency rating in Pac-12 play, per KenPom. He shot over 71% at the rim, and he's a legitimate floor-spacer. Bilodeau should give point guard Dylan Andrews his first real pick-and-pop threat. He's such a big offensive upgrade over what UCLA trotted out last season in its frontcourt, but Cronin will demand more out of him defensively. Transfer from: Kentucky Wagner was outshined by Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham at Kentucky, but his freshman year wasn't nearly as bad as some would lead you to believe. Wagner is good, and he can put opposing perimeter defenders in hell with his drives. Wagner is excellent at attacking the top foot and getting his defender off balance. The drives were impactful but Wagner has to improve finishing around the rim. That's arguably more important than continuing to progress as a shooter. Arkansas should give Wagner the runway to be a huge piece of this backcourt, but there are questions about his fit next to ball-dominant guards like Davis and freshman Boogie Fland. Maybe last season's experience next to Sheppard, Dillingham and Antonio Reeves will help Wagner find the sweet spot at Arkansas. Transfer from: Miami Poplar is really good at what he does. The 6-5 guard is a proven, high-level shooter who splashed over 37% of his treys in each of the past two seasons. He's also capable of attacking the rack with a vengeance for some monster posters, and Poplar will stick his face in the fan on the glass. He's been a productive role player, but Poplar transferred to Villanova to show he can be more than just a spot-up guard. Poplar wants the ball in his hands as a primary initiator, and Villanova's backcourt needs a star. Poplar believes it's his turn to prove that he can be that alpha once and for all. Transfer from: Texas It's been a struggle for Hunter to stay consistent offensively, but at his best, he's still one of the premier on-ball defenders in the game. Hunter is the closest thing to a true, set-the-table point guard of this new-look Tigers bunch, but his experience playing both on and off the ball at Texas should pay off next to new running mate PJ Haggerty. Memphis certainly needs Hunter's 3-point jumper to stick to open up extra space for Haggerty's drives. Hunter has shot over 36% from downtown in conference play in back-to-back seasons. Hunter should be unleashed to be in the hunt for First Team All-AAC honors. Transfer from: Wisconsin Hepburn is so much better when he doesn't have to be a go-to scorer. When Hepburn can unleash extra energy on defense, his value elevates. The Wisconsin transfer was well-schooled on the defensive end under Greg Gard, and he projects to be one of the best on-ball defenders in the ACC while giving Louisville's offense a steady hand. Hepburn is a career 36% 3-point shooter who makes great decisions and can go for 20 on nights when he has the right matchup. But the veteran point guard hits the floor trying to make others better. Pat Kelsey's high-tempo system could unlock the best version of Hepburn. Transfer from: Minnesota Hawkins is one of the top initiator point guards in the country, and this was a fantastic coup for Texas Tech's new-look backcourt. The Minnesota transfer will be the table-setter for Toppin's buckets around the rim and the 3s from Chance McMillian and Kerwin Walton. He will have the keys to this Texas Tech offense, and Hawkins deserves that opportunity. Hawkins throws exceptional lobs and he's so easy to play with. Hawkins also shot over 38% from downtown on over four attempts per game during Big Ten play, so you can't go under every screen. That opens up more space in the ball-screen game. Hawkins is only 5-foot-11 and 165 pounds, so he's an easy target for opposing offenses, but Texas Tech has insulated him with sturdy perimeter defenders to cover up some of his weaknesses on that end. Transfer from: Furman Pegues is a killer. He will take and make tough shots, and that type of guard is exactly what Auburn needed in the portal. Pegues played a variety of roles at Furman, first as a spot-up guy playing off Mike Bothwell and Jalen Slawson and then as a lead guard who had to initiate everything. That experience and variety should pay off right away for the Tigers. His nifty drives, pure jumper and smart playmaking give Pegues a chance to be Auburn's No. 2 option behind Johni Broome from the jump. Big fan of defense ➡️ offense plays pic.twitter.com/w7FMzFDSxU Transfer from: Georgia Tech Auburn's offense could bog down in late-clock situations last season, but it addressed that issue with Pegues and Kelly. At Georgia Tech, Kelly had to be a high-usage scorer who took tough shots. At Auburn, he'll have to embrace a lower-usage role with the benefit of much cleaner looks. Don't be fooled by the percentages, Kelly is a dynamic shooter and he can hit some tough stepbacks against even the best defense. Auburn coach Bruce Pearl has raved about Kelly often this season, often describing him as one of the best shooters he's ever had. Transfer from: South Carolina Johnson was a top-of-the-scouting report killer for South Carolina last season. He had a ton of responsibilities on his plate offensively. That experience should reap benefits in Round II at Ohio State. Johnson should slide right next to Bruce Thornton and form one of the top bucket-getting guard duos in the league next season. Johnson was the best version of himself at South Carolina with a pick-and-pop big man like BJ Mack. That's still an unproven question for Ohio State's frontcourt. But there's no doubt Johnson's drives are impactful. That first step is nasty. He'll be productive in his return to Ohio State. Transfer from: Eastern Washington Remember when Great Osobor followed his coach, Danny Sprinkle, from Montana State to Utah State and became a household name? Something similar could happen with Coward who followed David Riley from Eastern Washington to Washington State. The 6-foot-6, 205-pound wing is on NBA radars thanks to his versatility. Riley smartly uses Coward like the queen on the chess board, posting him up against smaller matchups or letting him stretch the floor and bend defenses with his drives. Coward shot 75% at the rim and 40% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. That'll play. He's a two-way player, too. Coward should get way more exposure in the WCC. Transfer from: Belmont All of Gillespie's advanced offensive stats last season at Belmont were terrific. Gillespie was extremely efficient from 3-point range, and he shot nearly 70% at the rim in halfcourt settings. That's nuts for a 6-foot-1 point guard. The question is whether all of that efficiency will translate against high-major opponents. Maryland is banking on it. Gillespie does not have to be Jahmir Young 2.0, but he'll get the first crack at replacing the Terps' All-Big Ten guard. Gillespie's dribble-handoff game with skilled five-star big man Derik Queen should be terrific. Transfer from: UNC Wilmington TCU coach Jamie Dixon has leaned into a heavy-transition offense the last few years, and White can help keep that train rolling. The slashing wing is a good, low-volume shooter, but he's just an awesome driver who constantly breaks down defenses and gets to the paint. He's so wiry and tough to stay in front of. History says you can find productive transfer-up targets from the CAA ranks, and White is up next. He's one of the best wing-handlers in the portal, and White can be one of TCU's better defenders from the jump. He doesn't check off quite as many boxes as Emanuel Miller, but White should replace a bunch of that production. Transfer from: Arkansas Mark was one of the top isolation scorers in the country last season. Mark shot over 70% at the rim and drew nearly five fouls per 40 minutes. He's constantly putting pressure on the defense with his drives and a midrange jumper he can comfortably get to whenever. He shot a career-best 36% from 3-point range for Arkansas, but it was on a bit lower volume (3.2 attempts per game). Mark should be one of Texas' best two-way players, and he might earn that closer role. Transfer from: Evansville Humrichous was one of the most impactful players in the country last season. Evansville was competent with Humrichous on the floor (+3.6 net rating) and a complete dumpster fire without him (-16.8 net rating). Illinois wants at least four shooters on the floor at all times, and that's Humrichous' game. Humrichous shot 42% on 142 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. The 6-foot-9 forward can fire over just about anybody. Humrichous also owns real wiggle off the bounce. If the right matchup presents itself, Illinois will be comfortable giving Humrichous the green light to go to work one-on-one to get to his fadeaway, midrange jumper. Humrichous is easily one of the top stretch forwards in the portal, and there weren't many of them in the free agency pool. Transfer from: Saint Mary's Saint Mary's defense was impenetrable when Jefferson was on the floor. Now, he heads to Iowa State to be a key cog for another elite defense. He'll guard those rangy forwards in the Big 12 that Milan Momcilovic would've had issues with. Jefferson's playmaking, defense and rebounding give him such a high floor. Iowa State can use him to back down good matchups from the slot, and he's a willing passer who can spray it and create advantages for drivers like Keshon Gilbert or shooters like Momcilovic, Tamin Lipsey or Curtis Jones. Jefferson is easily one of the most talented forwards T.J. Otzelberger has coached at Iowa State, and if the jumper continues to improve, he will leap into a new tier. Transfer from: Ohio State Richmond and Smith are the big-name gets for St. John's, but Scott is such a stud. There was a real shortage of stretch 4s in the portal, but St. John's landed one of the best out there. Scott shot over 37% on 115 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, and he is very comfortable getting into his post-ups from the slot. Plus, Scott projects to be an outstanding multi-positional defender. His floor spacing will be invaluable for St. John's. He might never sit. Transfer from: Pepperdine Everyone is looking for forwards as well-rounded as Ajayi. Gonzaga scooped him up quickly, and it was super familiar with his game after he tangled with the Zags often during his Pepperdine days. Ajayi should get the first crack at replacing versatile stud Anton Watson. Ajayi is more of a wing-handler who can play on the perimeter thanks to his gorgeous stroke and ability to attack long closeouts, but he's got a proven knack for rebounding. Gonzaga can use him in post-ups, as a popper in pick-and-rolls or even as the initiator for some ball-screen reps. Ajayi should be a high-level connector for a Gonzaga squad that has National Championship aspirations. Transfer from: Northern Colorado Saint Thomas balled out in the Dalton Knecht role at Northern Colorado. He's a big, physical wing who shot over 67% at the rim last season. That efficiency might come down in the Big Ten, but that aggressiveness has to be maintained. Thomas should settle right into a No. 1B option behind Claude. He'll have a high usage rate, and USC can use him as a post-up weapon or in ball screens. Thomas could also be featured as USC's pseudo-point guard, but his growth as a catch-and-shoot weapon is key. Transfer from: Virginia Tech The 6-10 big man should give Miami's defense some much-needed size on the back line. Kidd's best asset is his low-post dominance. Kidd was one of the top post-up scorers in college basketball last season and he has great hands in the pick-and-roll. Miami smartly added East Carolina transfer sniper Brandon Johnson to this frontcourt to make it even harder to send another big to double-team Kidd. Miami just has a cavalry of shooting surrounding Kidd. Transfer from: Drexel Skilled size is everything for Mark Pope's offense, and a center who can be a playmaker on the perimeter is vital. Williams is not a 3-point shooter, but he can clear open space with screens and dribble hand-offs. He's also an adept passer who had a 17% assist rate this past season at Drexel. Kentucky will also rely heavily on Williams to protect the rim and scoop up boards. The 6-foot-10, 265-pound big man has enough bricks in his britches to handle one-on-one coverage against just about any big man, so Kentucky won't have to send double teams. Playing with incoming sophomore Brandon Garrison might be a blessing in disguise for Williams. Kentucky can keep him fresh, out of foul trouble and his motor should be revving for the 20-to-25 minutes he's on the floor. Seven foot playmaker 🦄12 PTS (5-6 FG) | 6 AST | 5 REB pic.twitter.com/QH3oEW0oR7 Transfer from: Louisville \Huntley-Hatfield is the jewel of the NC State transfer haul. Huntley-Hatfield's tape was impressive amidst a rocky Louisville campaign. He became a double-double threat every night and played with outstanding effort. He's 6-foot-10 and 240 pounds with the ability to play multiple defensive coverages, and Huntley-Hatfield should continue to grow as a floor-stretcher. There's no reason to think he won't be a productive monster for NC State who knows how to feature its big men. Transfer from: Kentucky Bradshaw might make or break Ohio State. If his production matches his potential, the Buckeyes could be one of the best teams in the Big Ten. Bradshaw's ability to stretch the floor would open up the paint for Johnson and Thornton to get to the rack. The former five-star, 7-1 center was also regarded as a big-time rim protector during his high school days. Ohio State is banking on a Kel'el Ware-like bounceback season in a new place with a full bill of health. Transfer from: Tulsa Haggerty is a lean, mean, foul-drawing machine. The Tulsa transfer can put a ton of pressure on the rim, and his floater is a real weapon. And he pitches a tent, starts a fire and calls the free throw line home. Haggerty shot double-digit free throws in 15 games last season. That's a skill. Penny Hardaway needs Haggerty to shoot it better from downtown and find a way to impact winning without super high volume. Haggerty owned a 30% usage rate last season at Tulsa. It was his team. Memphis is loaded with talent. Haggerty's usage might not sniff 30% with Tyrese Hunter, Dain Dainja and Colby Rogers all needing to get theirs. But Haggerty's a heckuva talent who can be one of the engines of this club. Transfer from: FAU Martin is a big, physical 2-guard who will hunt his jumper and is a menace in transition. Martin struggled with injuries a bit last season, but if he's back to full strength, Florida was a smart landing spot for both sides. Florida coach Todd Golden is likely banking on Martin being the Gators' best perimeter defender. Martin gets in some trouble when he tries to create his own offense, but he's awesome in transition, an area that Florida heavily prioritizes. Transfer from: Michigan State Hoggard's strengths are obvious. Hoggard is a very good defender who can lock down just about any perimeter option. He's a terrific playmaker who nearly racked up a 3-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio this past season. Hoggard shot a serviceable 35% from 3-point range last season, but his issues offensively came inside the arc. For a big, strong guard, Hoggard struggled mightily to finish around the rim and his pull-up jumper went off the rails. Hoggard shot just 5-for-42 on those pull-ups. That almost feels too bad to replicate. Positive regression seems inevitable. Transfer from: South Dakota State Mayo is just a bucket, but his shots will come in different spots at Kansas than they did at South Dakota State. Mayo is expected to move into more of an off-ball role which should unlock more catch-and-shoot opportunities. Mayo drilled 43% of his 96 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season. Oh, and Mayo is a midrange maestro. That ability to go get a bucket should be a huge stress reliever for a KU offense that needed an extra jolt. Mayo is probably closer to a two-level scorer than a true three-level scorer, but his comfort as a primary scorer/creator at South Dakota State should help him ace a slightly scaled-down role for Kansas. We could get used to this 🎯#Payheed x @zekexmayo pic.twitter.com/RI8yundO7m Transfer from: Villanova Oregon crushed it in the portal and it starts with Bamba. The Villanova transfer is good at a little bit of everything. He shot over 43% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season and he can smartly attack long closeouts. Bamba is capable of handling some on-ball responsibilities as well, and he'll be an impactful defender for the Ducks. Bamba is a plug-and-play, two-way starter who should be a double-digit performer, at minimum. Transfer from: Stanford Stojakovic has excellent bloodlines and needed a fresh start after a rough freshman-year showing at Stanford. The flashes of brilliance were there as an off-ball sniper who is an excellent cutter and can smoothly drive it. When he played with confidence (check the USC film), Stojakovic was a baller. But the dark days were grim. The odds are strong that Stojakovic is going to be a really, really good player one day, but he has to clean up the mechanics on his jumper and continue to improve his body. Similar to Jaylon Tyson, Stojakovic made a wise choice in the portal to go somewhere where he can earn a high usage rate and have the ball in his hands from the jump. Transfer from: Oakland Good things happen when you pair a smart player like Townsend with a smart coach like Tommy Lloyd. The 6-6, 228-pound forward isn't a stretch 4 (he's made 50 3-pointers in 126 games), but he's closer to a wing handler who can constantly create advantages. He's in that Jaime Jaquez-lite mold as an excellent post-up weapon, good cutter, smart decision-maker who will not hurt you. Arizona ranked outside the top-60 nationally in points per possession in halfcourt settings, per Synergy. Not bad, but not great, either. An elite transition offense helped Arizona finish No. 11 overall in offensive efficiency, but there were real pockets when Arizona's offense could get bogged down. Townsend might be part of the solution. Townsend provides another halfcourt hub who can win one-on-one matchups and get to the free throw line. Transfer from: Ohio State Opponents shot just 54% at the rim against Ohio State when Okpara was on the floor. His length, court coverage and rim presence are extremely valuable. Okpara is a willing role player who is an excellent lob threat in pick-and-rolls, but he's not a center you want to run your offense through. Okpara still has work to do to become a reliable post-up scorer, but he should team up well with Zakai Zeigler's pinpoint lobs. Transfer from: Iowa Perkins has been a staple in Iowa's rotation for three years but the leap into being a legitimate First Team, All-Big Ten guy never truly materialized. But the 6-4, 205-pound guard is the most proven piece on this Mizzou roster. He's a very good scorer at two levels. Perkins loves to get to the middle of the floor for a midrange jumper. He's also constantly putting pressure on the rim and getting to the free throw line. Nearly 40% of his shots last season came at the rim, per Synergy, and he averaged over five free throw attempts per game in Big Ten play. His decision-making overall really grew which is encouraging. Perkins finished with a 2.4-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio. That'll work every single day of the week and twice on Sundays. Transfer from: Kansas State When Kaluma keeps it simple, he can be effective. Kaluma shot a career-best 36% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Kansas State. The 6-foot-7, 225-pound wing is a willing rebounder and has been part of good defenses both at Kansas State and Creighton. Kaluma can be an impactful piece when he attacks straight-line drives, drills spot-up 3s and hunts buckets in transition before the defense gets set. But he gets in so much trouble when he tries to be a top of the scouting report creator. Kaluma had a dreadful, negative assist-to-turnover ratio. He takes tough shots off the dribble and doesn't make 'em. He's yet to record an above-average offensive rating in conference play in each of the last three years. The flashes are there, but eliminating the negative plays will be so important. Transfer from: North Texas Edwards is a bucket. He was the high-usage engine of North Texas' offense, and Edwards finished with fantastic efficiency from downtown and the midrange despite his tape being filled with a ton of tough shots. The 6-foot guard just knows how to score, and a lightning-quick first step makes him such a tough cover. Vanderbilt's decision to pair a defensive-first playmaker like Hoggard with a score-first guard like Edwards looks like smart roster-building. Transfer from: Kentucky The powerful, 6-8 wing will be one of Arkansas' best multi-positional defenders. Thiero has pogo-stick bounce and can be an excellent secondary rim protector. He's probably best-suited guarding bigger wings or forwards, but Thiero can definitely hang on the perimeter and he'll always chip in on the glass. Offensively, he's a connector and a high-energy role player. Thiero is an outstanding cutter and offensive rebounder, but he can also attack long closeouts. Trying to hide your center on Thiero was not a great idea because of his fluid drives. But he needs to finish better at the rim and continue to expand his perimeter game. Thiero is rapidly getting better. He's a good bet to be in Arkansas' closing lineup because of his defense. Transfer from: Texas Cincinnati was an outstanding offensive-rebounding team while also being one of the best rim defenses. Mitchell will fortify those areas even more. The 6-8, 205-pound forward is one of the best athletes in the country. He covers so much ground defensively and racked up a block or a steal in 31 of 34 games last season. Cincinnati can play Mitchell at the 4 next to Aziz Bandaogo and build an iron wall around the rim. Cincinnati will dominate the glass with those two guys on the floor together, even if the floor-spacing is a real question. Mitchell has not made a jump as a shooter yet, but he's a phenomenal play-finisher. Mitchell shot over 77% at the rim and threw down a whopping 55 dunks last season. Mitchell is a legitimate lob threat and an excellent cutter who never stops moving. Maybe most importantly, Cincinnati had a way higher transition rate than Texas. That's money in the bank for Mitchell who can put on a show in the open floor. Transfer from: Dayton One of the best 3-point shooters in the country is joining one of the best offensive schemes for 3-point shooters. Is there truly anything else to say? .@kobybrea is just getting started 😮‍💨13 PTS (5-7 FG, 3-5 3FG) | 2 AST pic.twitter.com/dumTubh5aY Transfer from: Arkansas Gonzaga doesn't have many holes on the roster, but the Zags' staff hit the portal looking for one more get out of jail free card. Insert Battle. The Arkansas transfer won't be asked to shoulder a monster, alpha role, but he can slide into any lineup, whether off the bench or in the starting lineup, and just go get buckets. This is the best ecosystem of Battle's career. He'll give Gonzaga that rim pressure that it certainly needs from its backcourt. Transfer from: Florida Last offseason, Kugel was regarded as one of the top NBA prospects in the SEC, but his sophomore season at Florida was a major disappointment culminating with multiple "DNPs" in the SEC Tournament. Kugel's body language was ... not great. Mississippi State is hopeful a fresh scene can unlock his sky-high potential. The 6-foot-5, 205-pound guard just floats off the ground. He's a fantastic athlete, and that comes alive in transition. But his decision-making has to markedly improve and quickly. While the turnovers were harmful, the shot selection might have been even more detrimental. Kugel can make every shot in the book but that can be a blessing and a curse. This is an upside play by Chris Jans. If it clicks, Kugel can be the best overall player on the team, even better than stud sophomore guard Josh Hubbard. Transfer from: Stanford Angel shot over 43% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers and over 70% at the rim. That will play all day, every day. The 6-8, 240-pound, fifth-year senior just plays winning basketball. You can post him up against smaller defenders and he'll drag slower-footed bigs onto the perimeter. He's not overly dynamic but the Stanford transfer can knife to the rim and he's a heady cutter. Angel is only additive to everything else Oregon has cooking. Dana Altman found a gem. Transfer from: Tulane James is an elite role player who Jon Scheyer smartly added to this rotation. James is a warrior who rarely came off the floor at Tulane. He's not some high-volume sharpshooter, but 39% on 81 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers will play. He makes defenses pay for leaving him open. But it's all the little things that make James a stud. He's an excellent defender who is absolutely chiseled. He can hound shooters, big wings or lead guards while providing a little secondary rim protection, too. James might not start but he's going to carve out a major role for Duke. Transfer from: Stanford Carlyle was a former prized prospect but his freshman year at Stanford was filled with extreme highs (31 points against Washington State) and gut-wrenching lows (4-for-17 shooting against Colorado). He gives IU a second dynamic lead guard who can go get buckets in pick-and-rolls. He took more off-the-dribble 2-point jumpers (55) than catch-and-shoot 3-pointers (53). Get to the middle of the floor, and make something happen. That's his game. Refining his decision-making is paramount because the turnovers and shot selection were rough last season. Carlyle has a chance to be an excellent player down the road if the jumper sticks and he improves his meager 19% rim rate. He's too fast to let defenses off the hook by settling for pull-ups that often. A sixth-man role could make sense, but Carlyle can earn a spot in the starting (and closing) lineup if he guards his tail off. Transfer from: Toledo Xavier's floor spacing should be immaculate with Maddox and Conwell on the floor together. The Toledo transfer shot over 40% from 3-point range in three of his four seasons at the college ranks. The 6-foot-2, 195-pound guard is just a flamethrower, and he has sneaky bounce when he attacks the rack. Transfer from: Duke Power was buried at Duke, but he will get every opportunity to be a featured piece for Virginia. Power, a former five-star prospect, is a big-time shooter who showed real playmaking abilities in high school. Off-movement shooting is so valuable in Virginia's blocker-mover offense, and Power can do all of that. He's poised to be a productive ACC starter next season, but if Virginia can keep him around for multiple years, he has a chance to be a real star. Transfer from: Oregon State Texas has so many guys who are used to being the featured scorer. There's only one ball, so that could force Pope to change his game to help everyone else. Pope had to be a scorer first for an undermanned Oregon State club, and he did it well. Pope has a phenomenal jumper. He'll give Texas' offense real gravity, but he can be a bit jumper-reliant. He had a very low rim rate last season, but Pope was a sniper both off the catch (38%) and off the bounce (36%). IPope's jumper seems legit. That gives him a high floor. Transfer from: Minnesota Payne is a complete handful. Texas A&M is one of the elite offensive rebounding programs in the country, and the Minnesota transfer had the third-highest offensive rebound rate during Big Ten play. That'll work. He's so powerful and explosive. Payne is an awesome target in pick-and-rolls, and his physicality shows up on the defensive end. Payne plays really, really hard, and there's some intriguing skill starting to develop here too. Payne can occasionally run into problems when he faces up at the elbow and tries to create, but that freelancing ability is fun. He'll make some decent reads, too. He's not just an awesome screen-setting big man who will be a play-finisher, glass-cleaner and rim protector. There's more coming to his game in time. Transfer from: Chicago State Cardet is going to be a big part of the Devin Carter Replacement Plan. The 6-6, Chicago State transfer wing just wants to get to the rack. Over 50% of his shots last season came at the rim and he had a sky-high free throw rate. Playing off two feet will be essential to finish off his drives a bit better. Cardet is capable of getting going from all three levels, but simplifying his game will be key to finding success in a Big East that is so well-scouted If healthy, Bryce Hopkins is Providence's alpha, but Cardet is another capable double-digit scorer who can be the engine of the offense. He's a better shooter than the numbers suggest. He shot over 35% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, but he rarely played off the ball at Chicago State. Getting freed up for more spot-up opportunities should help Cardet's efficiency rise. Cardet should be an exceptional defender under Kim English who is one of the rising defensive coaches in the game. Transfer from: Omaha Michigan State needed a bucket-getting wing, and Fidler should get the first crack at earning that job. Fidler doesn't beat you with loads of athleticism, but he does a ton of his work before he gets the rock and the jumper is pure. Fidler was much more effective playing off the ball, and Michigan State will continue that trend. Improving as an on-the-move shooter would be huge. Fidler can use his size to rise over smaller defenders, and he uses shot fakes to clear space well and draw fouls. Fidler should be an efficient play-finisher for MSU who could be the answer in late-clock scenarios. Transfer from: Boston College Zackery is only additive and doesn't detract from anything else Clemson has cooking. He's thickly built and should be solid in so many areas. He's a career 40% 3-point shooter on just under three attempts per game. He guards. He takes good shots. Zackery developed into a nice ball-screen initiator with a pick-and-pop big man like Quintin Post at Boston College. Clemson can do some of the same things with Zackery and Ian Schieffelin or Chauncey Wiggins. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lubin does not have elite length or size, but he will outwork you. The Vanderbilt transfer has a ridiculous motor and attacks the rim with a vengeance. His second-jump burst is real. Lubin grew significantly as a roller, and he'll be a rock-solid, ball-screen partner for UNC's elite backcourt. UNC needed a reliable play-finisher offensively, and Lubin can do all that and then some. He's not some elite back-line defensive anchor, but Lubin should be able to play multiple coverages defensively and hold serve against some bigger 4s and smaller 5s. Transfer from: South Florida Pryor could be the X-Factor for this Louisville offense. Pat Kelsey just desperately needs the South Florida transfer to keep making 3-pointers at a high clip to pull centers away from the rim. Pryor is very comfortable playing in space and attacking long closeouts, but he gets very hard to guard in transition after he grabs-and-goes and attacks defenses who can't get set yet. His playmaking and unselfishness is something. Transfer from: Virginia Milicic is a sharp stretch 4. He shot 38% from 3-point range and that's his path to playing time. But he's not just roaming around the perimeter. Milicic is comfortable handling it and attacking open spaces off the bounce. He finished everything around the rim, and he's a tough cover off the ball. He'll dart in and out of screens, cut baseline, 45-cut and everything in between. Milicic's nose for the ball on the defensive glass should translate. Tennessee will have to adjust some things personnel-wise for Milicic's defense, but he's not a stiff. He should be just fine guarding 4s. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lawrence is a streaky shooter, but he's best when he's slashing to the tin. Two seasons ago, he shot over 64% at the rim at ridiculously high volume. Everything kinda cratered last season for a Vanderbilt team that splintered, but Lawrence's talent is still obvious. Lawrence is easily the most proven, high-major scorer on this much-improved Georgia roster. For the Dawgs to reach their goals, Lawrence has to regain his form and play like one of the best two-way guards in the SEC again. Transfer from: Michigan UConn has made the big-man platoon a huge part of their roster-construction gameplans, and it's not going anywhere in 2024-25. Samson Johnson and Reed will form a two-headed monster. Johnson is bouncy, athletic and extremely fast. Reed will bring more power. The 6-10, 265-pound big man has been watching plenty of Adama Sanogo tape. That type of physical, low-post monster is such a different archetype compared to Johnson. Reed is an elite rebounder, and he's going to draw fouls because of his activity and pure, raw power. UConn's proven player-development chops should be a huge boon. Transfer from: Ohio State Everything looks better when you shoot 46% from 3-point range on just 62 attempts, but Middleton should head into his sophomore season at Seton Hall with plenty of confidence. the former prized recruit was utilized as an off-ball wing at Ohio State who only had a 15% usage rate. Seton Hall can bump that up a bit, but we'll see just how ready Middleton is to be one of the top guys on the scouting report. If the 3-point stroke is real, Middleton will be a massive piece of this club. Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway needs him to stretch the floor, attack long closeouts and be a nasty wing defender. Middleton left Ohio State looking for more. Seton Hall gives him the chance at a huge role. Transfer from: Princeton This is one of the best fits in the portal. Allocco is a pure hooper. The Princeton transfer is so comfortable playing mismatch-hunting basketball, which is a staple of Micah Shrewsberry's game plan. He shot over 40% from downtown on both off-the-dribble 3-pointers and catch-and-shoot treys. He's also super comfortable getting to his midrange jumper or slicing his way to the rim. The decision-making is a nice benefit, too. Allocco has to get stronger to make his drives more impactful. He's also not the most explosive dude on the floor, but the wiggle is real. Allocco is a needle-mover, and Shrewsberry should have some fun cooking up some open looks for him to feast. Transfer from: Yale Wolf's tape is so fun. The Yale product can drop dimes from the middle of the floor, and he shot 35% on 83 3-pointers last season, so you have to respect the jumper. Michigan will likely try to play Wolf next to Goldin. Multiple 7-footers on the floor at the same time could be a little clunky, but both guys are so smart and Wolf's playmaking and shooting might make it work. Wolf isn't quite as intimidating a rim protector as Goldin, but his hands in drop coverage are sticky. He forced numerous deflections at Yale. Wolf is going to be a useful piece next year. He could be a terror in 2025-26 when Goldin exhausts his eligibility. 🐺🐺 pic.twitter.com/6VJAWxmCzA Transfer from: Syracuse Brown is an outstanding multi-positional defender who will help this unit compete to be the best defensive team in the country. Brown was an All-ACC defensive team selection in 2023-24, but he might be even better at Duke now that he doesn't have to bang with centers every single play. Everyone wants to be a switch-everything defender, but Brown actually is one. The Syracuse transfer will help douse so many fires, and his cutting and playmaking off the short roll will be a massive asset to Duke's offensive attack. Brown is another elite role player. Don't be surprised if Brown is a staple of Duke's closing lineup. Transfer from: Tennessee What an addition for Mike Rhoades in Happy Valley. Dilione was expected to have a bigger role at Tennessee last season, but Dalton Knecht stole all the headlines. Dilione now lands at Penn State and could be a phenomenal buy-low spot to get his career back on track. Dilione provides a huge jumbo playmaker who can stuff the stat sheet. On paper, the fit next to Ace Baldwin could be very fun if Dilione's jumper is legit. Baldwin is already a terrific on-ball defender and Dilione can grow into one too. This one has a chance to be a Hunter Sallis-like explosion spot for Penn State. Transfer from: Hofstra Carlos was a two-year starter for a very good Hofstra program, and he'll help fill the Judah Mintz void in Syracuse's backcourt. Carlos was one of the top pass-first, initiator point guards in the portal, and this has every opportunity to be a strong match for both sides. Carlos' ability to stretch the floor should free up the paint for JJ Starling to get more traction on his drives. Carlos is very jump-shot reliant (just 22% of his shots last season came at the rim), but the stroke is pure. Transfer from: Iowa State Well would you look at that, another five-star is transferring to Wake Forest after a disappointing first stop. It's up to Steve Forbes, aka the Transfer Portal Whisperer, to unlock the version of Biliew that never came to fruition at Iowa State. Biliew's freshman-year tape wasn't anything to write home about . He looked completely out of sorts and struggled to find any sort of footing for an Iowa State club that wanted to win big right away. Forbes is betting on the pedigree and a new scene. The former five-star recruit has athletic tools galore, and buffing up the frontcourt athleticism was one of the huge objectives for Wake Forest. Biliew doesn't need to be an offensive star right away, but he can have a huge impact on this team as a highly-active defensive whiz who can douse fires. If Wake Forest wants to win the ACC, it has to get through Duke. Who is the best bet to guard Cooper Flagg? Biliew. Transfer from: Arkansas DePaul has added so much shooting on the perimeter, but it needs someone to break down the defense and get into the paint. Insert Blocker. The Arkansas transfer is the most natural point guard on this roster and he punctured opposing defenses at will last season. He should lead this team in free throw attempts while offering nasty perimeter defense. The former prized recruit has a runway to a major role at DePaul and the roster construction is set up to best maximize his skills and keep the paint clear for his drives. This could end up being a diamond in the rough for DePaul. Transfer from: High Point Learn the name. This one has a chance to be a gem. Miles was one of the top pick-and-roll, bucket-getters in the country last season at High Point, and Porter Moser has a proven hit rate of getting plenty out of transfer-up guards from the lower levels. Miles was efficient in every area. He shot over 65% at the rim, 36% from 3-point range and 50% on his pull-up jumpers. Miles is also a terrific decision-maker. Transfer from: UMass The well-traveled Cross has turned into a heckuva player. He's a good bet to shoot around 35% from 3-point range on over two attempts per game. He's a great cutter, rebounder and playmaker. Cross finds mismatches and knows what to do with 'em. SMU dropped a bag to land Cross (who had a ton of interest from good teams galore), and the fifth-year senior will be worth it. Transfer from: Northern Iowa Born gets the first crack at replacing Colorado State legend Isaiah Stevens. Born isn't the distributor that Stevens was, but he can score that thing. The Northern Iowa transfer is on the doorstep of eclipsing 1,500 career points. Colorado State coach Niko Medved should be able to utilize the lefty sharpshooter in creative ways in the Rams' Princeton-style offense. Born will be one of the Mountain West's best scorers. Transfer from: Ohio State Dayton needed a post-up hub and found it in Key, an Ohio State transfer who was a bucket on the block. Key eats up one-on-one coverage and rapidly improved at finding open shooters when the double-team came his way. Key, a low-post beast, teaming up with Nate Santos, a stretch 4 deadeye, should be a fabulous match for a Dayton squad that intends to chase an A-10 crown. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Title: Companies Have a Major Challenge Enforcing RTO Mandates
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/the-latest-challenge-with-rto-mandates-enforcing-them/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T15:51:56Z
Full Content:
Despite more companies issuing return-to-office (RTO) mandates, the latest challenge those companies face is enforcing them. Companies large and small have issued RTO mandates, with three days in the office becoming the accepted norm. A few, such as Amazon, have issued far stricter policies, requiring employees to be in the office five days a week. According to CBRE’s 2024 Americas Office Occupier Sentiment Survey, the vast majority of companies are failing in their efforts to enforce their office mandates. Approximately 80% of organizations have a return-to-office policy, but only 17% actively enforce these policies. This disconnect between policy and enforcement contributes to the gap between employer expectations and employee behavior: 60% want employees to work in the office three or more days per week, but only 51% of employees are in the office that frequently. Thirty-four percent of respondents anticipate closing this gap by increasing attendance. Space sharing remains top of mind to align with new utilization patterns and optimize portfolios. Interestingly, the number of companies with an RTO policy increased only slightly from 2023, going from 78% to the current 80%. Even more telling, barely more than half of companies measure compliance with their mandates, and very few enforce it. For the companies with an office attendance policy, measurement and enforcement strategies vary. Fifty-one percent of respondents with a policy report that they mandate attendance, but only about 45% measure it, and only 17% consistently enforce it. This disconnect is a factor in the continued gap between employer expectations and employee behavior. While policies are important for clarification and guidance, they are not guaranteed to drive compliance, especially without enforcement. CBRE’s findings indicate that trying to force compliance without understanding the underlying opposition will only lead to negative outcomes. At the same time, holding employees accountable to mandates can create negative outcomes if employers don’t strive to understand, and remedy, the barriers blocking more frequent office utilization. Employers who remain frustrated with lack of office utilization should explore the underlying challenge in order to deploy the right lever for change. Despite some companies’ insistence on returning to pre-pandemic norms, data increasingly shows that hybrid work is the future and RTO mandates are often disastrous. Some governments, such as the UK, are even endorsing remote work, saying companies need to stop being obsessed with a “culture of presenteeism.” Amazon is already learning this, with a recent Blind survey of 2,585 Amazon employees showing that 73% of them were considering looking for another job. Some 80% of those surveyed said they already knew of peers who were looking for another job, while 32% knew of someone who had already quit. Some Amazon employees have stated they have no intention of complying with the RTO mandate, opting to be fired instead. Trust is at the heart of the issue, and companies are reaping what they’ve sown over the last few years, beginning with the mass layoffs that hit the tech industry during the waning days of the pandemic. As we wrote then, companies were destroying the trust of their employees, something that would eventually come back to haunt them. We quoted an article by Business Insider’s Sawdah Bhaimiya. “Every time I see a notice in the news that such and such technology company has cut X percentage of their workforce, I don’t forget that,” Danny Allen, chief technology officer at software firm Veeam, told Bhaimiya at the time. “So you’re sending a message that also has a brand impact that you don’t necessarily want to be associated with. “Employees remember and people looking for jobs remember how organizations acted during the economic downturn.” Allen went on to explain exactly how the layoffs would hurt companies, with the second way being the most important in this context. “One is simply the loss of innovation, cutting resources,” said Allen. “You’re cutting your investment in future technology, that’s number one. Number two, when you cut 10% of your workforce, you’re sending the message to your employees that we care more about money than we do about you. “And employees have a long memory, so if you’re cutting people that uncertainty is very disconcerting.” Amazon is a good example of exactly the phenomenon Allen described, with many of those reluctant to return to the office citing a lack of trust in the company’s leadership, a lack of trust exacerbated by broken promises about the future of remote work. “I was not complying,” an employee named Ben said about the company’s previous three-day-a-week mandate, citing the three-hour commute he faced as the reason. “I decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want,” he added. That last part of Ben’s statement is critical, as doesn’t trust any sacrifice made for his job will pay off over the long haul. His sentiments were echoed by others. “My months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end,” an employee named Laura said after the five-day mandate. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” she adds. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” As Ben and Laura’s statements illustrate, Amazon’s leadership has lost the trust of its employees, first with mass layoffs that underscored the transience of jobs in the tech industry. Trust was further eroded by promising that some roles would remain remote or hybrid, only to then renege on those promises and demand employees return to the office, even requiring them to relocate if necessary to comply. As long as companies continue to ignore the data—which shows that remote/hybrid employees work harder and are more productive—companies will continue to struggle with efforts to force compliance with RTO mandates. Companies that do enforce them will reap the results, losing top employees and struggling to attract new talent.

Title: AbbVie is buying an Alzheimer's drug for more than $1 billion

AbbVie (ABBV+1.35%) announced Monday that it is buying Aliada Therapeutics for $1.4 billion. The deal includes Aliada’s lead drug candidate ALIA-1758, an experimental antibody being tested for treating Alzheimer’s disease. The pharma giant said the move is part of its strategy to strengthen its neuroscience pipeline. Earlier this year, AbbVie halted development on its own Alzheimer’s treatment as a standalone therapy. “Neuroscience is one of our key growth areas and we are committed to driving innovation in this field to address critical unmet needs for patients living with seriously debilitating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,” said AbbVie chief scientific officer Roopal Thakkar in a press release. ALIA-1758 targets amyloid beta, a brain protein believed to be a cause of Alzheimer’s. The drug will also use make use of Aliada’s drug delivery technology, which helps move molecules across the blood-brain barrier for better efficacy. “Many promising CNS-targeted [central nervous system] therapies fail to reach late-stage trials due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier,” Aliada chief medical officer Michael Ryan said in the release. “Our MODEL platform addresses this challenge directly, efficiently delivering targeted drugs and potentially transforming how we treat neurological diseases.” The deal comes as the other pharma companies are working on their own new Alzheimer’s medications. Both Eli Lilly and Biogen have recently launched new Alzheimer’s drugs. Eli Lilly (LLY-0.34%) is also conducting a phase 3 clinical trial on another drug targeting amyloid beta. Recent studies have also found that GLP-1 treatments, the class of diabetes and weight loss drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-1.64%) Ozempic and Wegovy, are linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s. Novo Nordisk is currently conducting two clinical trials testing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, to see if the drug has an effect on early Alzheimer’s disease.

Title: Dragon Age: The Veilguard Review – BioWare’s Back
URL: https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T15:00:45Z
Full Content:
It would be the euphemism of the year to say that for BioWare, a lot is riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The once revered maker of roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age has stumbled severely with its last two games, Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem. The latest installment in the sci-fi franchise wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either, and it didn't sell as well as BioWare's parent company, Electronic Arts, wanted. The real catastrophe was Anthem, though. The new intellectual property was designed as a live service game that would be updated for ten years post-launch, but it ended up getting only a couple of patches before the overwhelmingly negative reception from critics and fans alike essentially halted that content roadmap. For a while, BioWare attempted to concoct a major overhaul (dubbed Anthem Next) that could resurrect Anthem, but EA ultimately chose to abandon the project and let the studio focus on its core franchises: Dragon Age and Mass Effect. Anthem also had a big influence on the fourth Dragon Age game. At some point, the idea was to make another live service game with coop, and reporter Jason Schreier even said the developers internally referred to it as 'Anthem with dragons.' Luckily, the magnitude of Anthem's failure, combined with the success of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, proved to Electronic Arts that single player games could still be financially successful, convincing the publisher to allow BioWare to focus solely on the campaign and drop multiplayer altogether. By mere syllogism, one could say that Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has effectively saved the beloved Canadian studio. Many fans feared a third unsuccessful game could persuade Electronic Arts to either sell BioWare or shut it down altogether, and with 2024 proving a terrible year for layoffs and studio closures, this was a concrete possibility. Of course, what Respawn's game actually did was give BioWare a chance, which they could still have squandered. I'm happy to share, though, that they did not. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a great ride that any fan of the studio's games will be able to enjoy. The key part is that the developers successfully invested in their own strengths rather than trying to follow the latest trends even if they were out of their expertise. I'm referring specifically to the decision to abandon the open world-like zones of Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Mass Effect Andromeda) in favor of a more old-school approach, reminiscent of the earlier installments in those franchises. Nowadays, it's getting harder and harder to find games that do not offer open world design. Even indie developers, thanks to game-making tools like Epic's Unreal Engine, can do it relatively easily, and many publishers think of it as a definite plus for any upcoming game. It must have taken BioWare a considerable amount of convincing to get EA to approve the idea, but they did it, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard is definitely better off like this. I have to admit I was skeptical at first, as I am a big advocate of open-world games in general; however, this game proved to me that there's a place for mission-based Western RPGs going forward. For one thing, it goes a long way toward ensuring the game does not overstay its welcome, as everything is more or less connected to the story and the characters. It was not so in Inquisition, and content bloat is indeed an issue in many open world games save for the very best ones (and even those do have some side content that is just not on the same level as the rest, which developers are forced to add just to populate all the world). That is not to say Dragon Age: The Veilguard doesn't have relatively straightforward quests, but they are still grounded in the same narrative tissue, making them feel like part of one cohesive story. Following the few initial missions, the player navigates Thedas by accessing the world map and traveling with the Eluvians, the magical mirrors made by ancient elves that allow long-distance travel. Access to the Eluvians may come and go depending on progress (you'll have to unlock some) and story (in some cases, you must head to a specific area just for one mission, and the game will unlock the Eluvian for you). Still, some options remain available for most of the game, allowing players to revisit the same zone multiple times. It's a good thing, too, because there's actually a fair amount of exploration in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Make no mistake, this is no Elder Scrolls, and you won't find NPCs going on about their lives as in an open world game that simulates real life. Rather, BioWare chose the old-school approach first popularized by the Metroidvania genre: there's a ton of loot and secrets hidden behind puzzles and companion abilities, so you will have plenty of reason to return to exploration regions like the Arlathan Forest, Minrathous, Rivain, the Necropolis Halls, Treviso, the Hossberg Wetlands, and the Crossroads beyond just quests. If you want to make the most out of that exploration feeling, it might be a good idea to remove the mini-map, which is one of several tweaks allowed within the accessibility options. Would I have preferred more expansive zones? Sure, but they may have come at the cost of something else. Given the quality of the final game, I'm happy with the tradeoff. By the way, prepare yourselves to open countless chests and collect innumerable resources lying around, even in the most linear missions, up to the very final one. And remember: break any box or vase you see in the environments, because they will yield resources that can be used or sold to vendors. Those elements may be a bit trite, but there's a reason they have worked for decades: they make the player feel good, and that's still true to this day. Pretty much the same happens in some of the most acclaimed games of the recent past, such as Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse saga. Overall, I finished all the missions in the game (save for two particularly challenging puzzles) in 78 and a half hours, not far at all from the 80-hour mark BioWare promised in the review guide. I would say it's almost perfect for a mission-based RPG: quite meaty but about half as long as the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, which perhaps will make it more replayable. Granted, if you wish to complete it quicker, you can absolutely do it - the main path is said to be around 35 to 40 hours. One of the main areas of innovation for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is in its combat system. Whereas the previous titles featured a larger party of four companions and allowed players to take direct control of the companions, this one sticks to a party of three and only lets you move around as the player character, just like in the Mass Effect series. Moreover, players have to choose three active abilities and an ultimate for their character plus three abilities per companion, whereas Inquisition featured way more selectable abilities in combat. This caused concerns among fans that the franchise's trademark tactical element would be lost or diminished. However, that's not the case at all. First and foremost, as the developers had already disclosed prior to launch, several abilities have been baked into the core moveset of each class (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) and do not count toward that same pool of abilities. For example, the Mage can side-step attacks or Fade-step for a longer dodge by double tapping the same button; they can perform a sprint attack or a jump attack with both light and heavy attack buttons; they can charge light attacks, heavy attacks, and ranged attacks by holding the respective buttons. There are also different mechanics based on the weapon you're using, which can be switched at all times in combat: while the staff lets you create a defensive shield that is maintained as long as you have mana, the dagger and orb are more geared toward a melee type of character who must parry at the right time to be effective. Dagger and orb also have unique mechanics called Arcane Marks, which are applied to the enemy with light attacks; once you get to three hits, you apply an Arcane Bomb, which can be triggered with a heavy attack for heavy damage. This is just the very basics. Most of these attacks and moves can be augmented through gear and talents; for example, the Greater Passive downfall turns every jump attack on knocked-down foes into a critical hit. The Trait Fade Strike lets you perform a powerful follow-up attack after Fade-stepping; Imbued Defense provides the Shocking Weapons buff (+25% weapon damage) after performing a Perfect Defense, while Return Fire lets you perform a quick counterattack after the aforementioned Perfect Defense. And this is just for the core moveset; there are as many traits and passives that work on the active abilities and other aspects of your build. On that note, did I say there are also Runes? You can equip three of those at a time (though activating one sets off a shared cooldown) and they can be extremely useful depending on the situation. Examples include freezing or knocking down all nearby enemies, losing all mana to get a big heal, instantly refreshing your or your companion's ability cooldowns, greatly enhancing the efficacy of your next ability, and more. I unlocked twenty-four runes during my time with the game, and each comes with a passive and an active effect to trigger at the right time. As someone whose favorite genre is RPGs (and MMORPGs), I can safely state that Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers an impressive amount of depth in its build creation. Best of all, skill points can be refunded for free whenever outside of combat, allowing users free reign to tinker around and create their favorite build synergies with a great many options at their disposal. That includes companions, by the way, who are still very important - far more than in any Mass Effect game, I'd say, when it comes to combat. While their skill trees are not as extensive, they still offer several options that players would be wise to carefully evaluate depending on their play style. There are so many buffs and debuffs to consider, not to mention each enemy's vulnerability and resistances, which you can check at any time in combat by pausing the action and bringing up the ability wheel. That's where you can tell each companion what to do against which target, largely preserving the core tactical element of Dragon Age. It may be different on the lower difficulties, but when playing on Underdog (the second-toughest difficulty after Nightmare, which, however, locks you into that difficulty when beginning a playthrough), pausing the action to think about what to do and properly order the companions around was instrumental to say the least, especially to set up the detonation combos, which work by applying and then triggering an effect like Weakened, Sundered, or Overwhelmed on a target. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is no Dark Souls, but its encounter design is excellent and it offers a worthy challenge even to experienced action and RPG players. There are some fantastic boss fights in the game, both in terms of spectacle and mechanics, forcing you to grow your character and perhaps change your build a bit, as well as learn how to counter the boss's moves as in any great action game. There is a bit of a catch in that companions do not actually take damage - they are effectively invulnerable in combat. That said, enemies do attack them from time to time, and two of them offer specific taunt abilities to get the attention off you (there's also a Rune that diverts enemies to the rest of the party for a short while). This may irk those who yearn for realistic fights, but in practice, it did not bother me at all. The game was clearly designed around this limitation (probably because they wanted to avoid the issue where they died all the time and forced the player to revive them over and over again) and I did not feel it negatively impacted Veilguard. In fact, the changes made compared to Inquisition's middling combat are almost entirely for the better. Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an outstanding combat system that finds the perfect balance between action and tactics, giving it a unique identity in the RPG genre. BioWare's games have always been narrative-driven, and this one is no exception. The game follows directly on the events seen in Inquisition and its Trespasser DLC with a ten-year gap (just like in real life), and it can be considered the culmination of storylines that have been in motion for a long time in the series. Dragon Age lore aficionados will find several earth-shattering revelations that answer some long-standing questions. Effectively, this game closes one chapter of the overarching world narrative, and the next installment will inevitably have to be centered around different themes and characters. For this reason, those who played previous installments and know about the lore will get the most enjoyment, although it is not a barrier to newcomers. While creating the player character (the character creator is very robust, although not the most complex I've seen in a game), the game also lets you create the Inquisitor, the protagonist of the previous game, and choose how a few key events from Inquisition unfolded. Having choices and consequences reverberate throughout their games has also characterized the studio's previous work, especially in Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Again, Veilguard does not disappoint in this area, either. Early on, there will be a major decision to make: the villains are attacking two cities at once, and you cannot be there for both. Each city is tied to one of the companions, and the 'forgotten' city and companion will be transformed in a way. The companion will become ineligible for some time as they deal with the fallout, and when they come back, they will be 'hardened', empowering their damage abilities while closing down their healing ones as they are now hellbent on vengeance. This is an interesting system, both narratively and mechanically, so it's a shame that it does not seem to apply to the other companions as well. Other than that, you will guide the companions in their personal quests through harrowing times of acceptance and personal struggles, with companion quests ranging from relaxed hangouts to sprawling missions that lead to complex boss fights. Seeing a companion through the entire personal quest is not only fulfilling from a storyline perspective, it will also allow you to maximize the bond with them, level them up, and elevate them to Hero of the Veilguard, a status that empowers their abilities and makes them more likely to survive the final fight. That's really where most of the choices and efforts made throughout the whole game come to fruition. Allowing each of the companions to solve their conflicts and each of the factions to be as strong as possible is a big factor in attaining the best possible ending, although there are some choices to make even in the final fight, such as sending the right companion to accomplish a certain task. Overall, the writing in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is great, and the voiceover and tech improvements (mainly facial animations, eyes, and the amazing hair) also help a great deal with the presentation. Just do not expect to act as a villain or even just drive away companions. While in some instances a certain dialogue option led to a companion disapproving, those were so far and few between to not actually matter. This is not that kind of RPG - you're supposed to be a hero. Companions can be befriended and romanced, as in most previous BioWare titles. In my experience, the romance was a slow but steady buildup, though that may depend on the character, and it's fine by itself since it felt good when it finally happened. There's practically no nudity to speak of, anyway, so if you were hoping for steamy sex scenes like in Baldur's Gate 3, you're out of luck. Also, a minor criticism regarding cutscenes is that most of the time, companions do not intervene when talking to other NPCs, even when it would be entirely appropriate for them to do so (for instance, when talking with the leaders of the resistance of their city of provenance). Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield, on the other hand, featured a lot of instances where companions interjected, making conversations feel more lively and realistic. Granted, there's still a lot of great banter between companions themselves, and you won't miss on any of that just because you've suddenly entered combat - they are now smart enough to resume that talk once things have settled down. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs on the Frostbite engine, just like the last three games made by the studio. Much has been written on the hardships encountered by the BioWare developers as they attempted to tame an engine originally made for shooter games. In the lead-up to the release, the developers mentioned that they had finally learned how to best use Frostbite. That may be the case, but the performance is honestly underwhelming. I played on a PC with nearly the best combination of CPU and GPU one money can buy (an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090), and yet I had to deal with considerable stuttering throughout it all. That's even with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (upscaling from 1080p to 4K) and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, not to mention the optimized Game Ready driver installed. The only way to reduce those stutters was to essentially remove ray tracing, or rather, switch to the 'RT Selective' option, which only applies ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion to specific areas of the game that best showcase the respective effects. Even so, they were not eliminated and occurred regularly. Those were not shader stutters, by the way. The game compiles shaders the first time you launch it, recompiles them if you change drivers, and verifies them anyway each time before loading the menu. They had to be traversal stutters, as we're used to seeing with Unreal Engine games. However, while Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks good, it doesn't compare to the latest triple-A Unreal Engine releases. Honestly, it might be worth it for EA to allow BioWare to use Unreal Engine, just like Respawn, going forward. I also had to contend with a bug for my whole playthrough: when launching the game with HDR enabled and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, there were flickering skies until I turned off and then on again DLSS FG. On the upside, HDR was well implemented, which is unfortunately rare. From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal. Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher). With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/28/2024 7:51:55 AM PDT by SeekAndFind For the last 15 years, all you've needed to do to achieve double-digit returns on your money was park it in an S&P 500 index fund, reinvest dividends, and forget about it. That happy ride may be over, according to a new note from Goldman Sachs that has Wall Street abuzz.The big picture: The S&P is on track to return only about 3% a year in the coming decade, Goldman's portfolio strategy group estimates. Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

It says what it wants the market to do. Probably time to invest in SP500. 2 posted on 10/28/2024 7:56:13 AM PDT by MeanWestTexan (Sometimes There Is No Lesser Of Two Evils) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind HERE's the COMMENT MADE BY THE OXFORD INCOME GROUP REGARDING GOLDMAN SACH's PREDICTION: To put that into perspective, the S&P 500 Index has produced an average annual return of about 10.3% since its 1957 inception. If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth.” ************* No question about that. Favorable policies that promote business expansion and individual wealth creation can serve to lubricate economic growth. And there’s a good chance of that happening if Trump gets elected. That said, the market is at a high valuation level right now and investors need to be mindful that returns are determined by the price you pay for something. 7 posted on 10/28/2024 8:14:42 AM PDT by Starboard [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SaxxonWoods “I just buy Buffet, a few high dividend stocks, a few market ETFs, Bonds and relax.” ************ I like your strategy. Holding some income producing assets can provide a “cushion” during market declines, and are icing on the cake when the market is rising. 8 posted on 10/28/2024 8:21:18 AM PDT by Starboard [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind That’s because the $trillion dollar federal reserve magic money printing is coming to an end. The spigot is being shut off and no longer debasing the currency. This will cause inflation to go way down and restore the value of the dollar.

You can do that with Vanguard dividend index funds which have done reasonably well compared to the S&P500. I complement that with QQQ and other growth index funds. A key point of this article seems to be that growth has been driven by a subset of companies invested in AI. I would counter that there will always be some version of that happening. Always problems needing to be solved. Dem control provides a caustic environment but stock performance has continued despite dem efforts to destroy the economy. Stock performance has done surprisingly well under dem Presidents. But all bets are off if the dems secure overwhelming control of both branches of Congress. In the end no one can predict the future and the market involves lots of risk and is not for everyone. 12 posted on 10/28/2024 8:49:17 AM PDT by plain talk [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: MeanWestTexan Sounds like an echo of what I just said to the walls of my study.

Great investors pay a lot of attention to valuation measures and profitability metrics (ROIC, free cash flow, etc) and they have the discipline to sell when those indicators deteriorate. 14 posted on 10/28/2024 9:48:25 AM PDT by Starboard [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Asking my broker’s advice Me. “What should I do?” Him. “Sell, sell, sell.” Me. “What and are you going to do?” Him. “Buy, buy, buy . . .” 15 posted on 10/28/2024 9:48:35 AM PDT by fella ("As it was before Noah so shall it be again," ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaxxonWoods The Wall of Worry is my friend. 16 posted on 10/28/2024 2:54:39 PM PDT by Jacquerie (ArticleVBlog.com) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

"As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Title: S&P 500's era of hot stock market returns is over, Goldman Sachs says

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/28/2024 7:51:55 AM PDT by SeekAndFind For the last 15 years, all you've needed to do to achieve double-digit returns on your money was park it in an S&P 500 index fund, reinvest dividends, and forget about it. That happy ride may be over, according to a new note from Goldman Sachs that has Wall Street abuzz.The big picture: The S&P is on track to return only about 3% a year in the coming decade, Goldman's portfolio strategy group estimates. Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Probably time to invest in SP500. 2 posted on 10/28/2024 7:56:13 AM PDT by MeanWestTexan (Sometimes There Is No Lesser Of Two Evils) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind HERE's the COMMENT MADE BY THE OXFORD INCOME GROUP REGARDING GOLDMAN SACH's PREDICTION: To put that into perspective, the S&P 500 Index has produced an average annual return of about 10.3% since its 1957 inception. If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Goldman never publicly says what it believes. It says what it wants the market to do. Probably time to invest in SP500. You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read. I just buy Buffet, a few high dividend stocks, a few market ETFs, Bonds and relax. If Bonds stop returning money above the rate of inflation I’ll look at real estate. Writing about stocks is a moneymaker, and it has no risk. No one will remember this prediction in 3 days. it was over a long time ago. viz: inflation. The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives. place your bets. I have invested in non woke “mutual fund”. My small protest. https://acvetfs.com/ “And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth.” ************* No question about that. Favorable policies that promote business expansion and individual wealth creation can serve to lubricate economic growth. And there’s a good chance of that happening if Trump gets elected. That said, the market is at a high valuation level right now and investors need to be mindful that returns are determined by the price you pay for something. “I just buy Buffet, a few high dividend stocks, a few market ETFs, Bonds and relax.” ************ I like your strategy. Holding some income producing assets can provide a “cushion” during market declines, and are icing on the cake when the market is rising. That’s because the $trillion dollar federal reserve magic money printing is coming to an end. The spigot is being shut off and no longer debasing the currency. This will cause inflation to go way down and restore the value of the dollar. Wall Street billionaires and defense contractors will have to look elsewhere to fleece the American public. /spit “high valuation level right now” That is what I look at—imho the stock market is enjoying a bubble right now—a good time for folks who have made a lot of money in the market to declare victory.... and start selling. Pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered. “Holding some income producing assets can provide a “cushion” during market declines” Yes. You can do that with Vanguard dividend index funds which have done reasonably well compared to the S&P500. I complement that with QQQ and other growth index funds. A key point of this article seems to be that growth has been driven by a subset of companies invested in AI. I would counter that there will always be some version of that happening. Always problems needing to be solved. Dem control provides a caustic environment but stock performance has continued despite dem efforts to destroy the economy.

Title: Reddit’s High-Flying Run Faces AI-Training Data Test in Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Reddit Inc. shares have been on a tear since going public earlier this year, and the social-media company’s unique place in the artificial intelligence landscape will dictate whether the rally continues. Most Read from Bloomberg Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow Is Denver’s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off? NY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link A South Korean City Plays Matchmaker to Tackle a Fertility Crisis There Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC’s Historic Meatpacking District The stock is up 139% since it began trading in March, the best performance among this year’s IPOs to raise at least $310 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The next test of that rally will come with the Tuesday release of its third-quarter results. Wall Street expects the company to report revenue growth of about 50% from the year-ago period. The analyst consensus for revenue has risen by 11% over the past three months. Reddit is expected to be profitable on an adjusted basis, though not in terms of net earnings per share. A key focus of the report will be how much money Reddit expects to make by licensing its data to train AI models. It has signed data licensing agreements worth more than $200 million over the coming years, including with Alphabet Inc.’s Google and OpenAI. The company made nearly all — 98.1% — of its 2023 revenue from advertising, and that continues to be its central business. However, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh expects licensing deals with AI companies that train their large language models on Reddit’s content to “further accelerate top-line gains.” The company also “may continue to see a boost in its Google-driven LLM traffic,” Singh wrote last week. Reddit shares were up 0.3% on Monday, having briefly touched an intraday high of $82.53 earlier in the day. Reddit captured interest from investors looking for companies tied to AI. Its shares climbed 48% in its first day as a public company after raising $860 million. The gains for Reddit have only accelerated in the months since going public as it powered higher after restrictions preventing long-time investors from selling were lifted. Reddit’s rise places it alongside other AI darlings like ARM Holdings Plc and Astera Labs Inc., which are among the top performing companies to debut since 2021. Shares of each have more than doubled since their IPOs. AI platform Cerebras and AI hyperscaler CoreWeave are among companies considering going public in the coming months. Reddit’s second-quarter revenue topped expectations, contributing to the stock’s strong performance. Over the past six months, its gains have been roughly triple those of Meta Platforms Inc., the Facebook parent that is investing heavily in AI to improve ad targeting, among other functions. Meta is scheduled to report on Wednesday. Other social stocks, including Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc., have declined over the past six months because of weaker growth trends and forecasts. The strength in Reddit has taken it above the average analyst price target, suggesting Wall Street isn’t betting on additional gains over the coming 12 months. It has also contributed to a swollen valuation. It trades at nearly 140 times estimated earnings and 9.4 times estimated revenue, compared with Meta’s earnings multiple near 24. However, many analysts expect the company to improve its profitability and expand margins going forward, which would tamp down the multiple. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, wrote that “most institutional investors we speak with expect Reddit to triple Ebitda margins from 16% in 2024 to >40% by 2030, and many wonder if their models are still too conservative.” Analysts at Jefferies estimate Ebitda will more than double in the next two years. Around 62% of analysts recommend buying the stock, while a third have the equivalent of a hold rating. Meta and Pinterest are viewed much more favorably by analysts. --With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared. Oil futures tumbled nearly 6%, taking Brent (BZ=F) down to almost $71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) to near $67. The focus is on tech stocks with five of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps due to release earnings this week, after the Nasdaq Composite bucked Friday's losing trend to close near a record. Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test. In the forefront are the latest reading on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the October jobs report — both seen as crucial to policymakers' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their November meeting. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Elsewhere, stocks in Japan rallied after the country's ruling party failed to hold onto its majority in elections on Sunday — underscoring political risks to markets with the US presidential vote just days away. Spotify (SPOT) shares rose nearly 1% in morning trading after Wells Fargo (WFC) named the stock a top pick, maintaining its Overweight rating and raising its price target from $420 to $470. Spotify has soared over 120% as the company has made good on its turnaround plan. After weak performance in late 2022, Spotify has announced layoffs, enacted price hikes, changed its royalty model, and picked up big podcast deals. The music streaming giant reported a record profit in its most recent quarterly earnings report this summer. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in his note to investors Monday that Spotify "continues to demonstrate success on long-term margin expansion." Spotify reports third quarter earnings on Nov. 12, and analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to rise over 400% to $1.82 and revenue to jump 19% to $4.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Wall Street analysts covering the stock, on average, see shares rising to $410 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened higher on Monday to start a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. Oil slid nearly 6% after Israel's retaliatory strikes on Iran spared the country's crude infrastructure. Brent (BZ=F) hovered near $71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded near $67 in early trading. Investors await earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) this week. The monthly inflation print and jobs report for September are also due out this week. Boeing (BA) shares ticked slightly lower in premarket after the plane maker launched an almost $19 billion share sale in a move to shore up its liquidity and avoid a credit downgrade. The company plans to sell about 90 million common shares and about $5 billion of depositary shares. Wall Street analysts had widely expected a large offering after a difficult year for the plane maker. S&P Global recently placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the machinist union strike at the company continues until the end of the year. Last week, a majority of workers rejected the latest labor contract proposal from Boeing. Earlier this month, the jet manufacturer said it would cut about 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce. As of Sept. 30, Boeing had $56.9 billion of outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness, according to a company filing.

Tel Aviv’s attack against Iranian military facilities early Saturday were in response to Tehran’s missile strikes on October 1. Oil was volatile in the weeks preceding the retaliation with Brent touching $80 per barrel as traders speculated whether Israel would strike against Iran’s oil infrastructure.

US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared. Oil futures tumbled nearly 6%, taking Brent (BZ=F) down to almost $71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) to near $67. The focus is on tech stocks with five of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps due to release earnings this week, after the Nasdaq Composite bucked Friday's losing trend to close near a record. Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test. In the forefront are the latest reading on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the October jobs report — both seen as crucial to policymakers' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their November meeting.

Spotify has soared over 120% as the company has made good on its turnaround plan. After weak performance in late 2022, Spotify has announced layoffs, enacted price hikes, changed its royalty model, and picked up big podcast deals. The music streaming giant reported a record profit in its most recent quarterly earnings report this summer. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in his note to investors Monday that Spotify "continues to demonstrate success on long-term margin expansion." Spotify reports third quarter earnings on Nov. 12, and analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to rise over 400% to $1.82 and revenue to jump 19% to $4.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Wall Street analysts covering the stock, on average, see shares rising to $410 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data.

Title: New 400-mile 2024 Chevy Silverado EV Work Trucks now cost same as used
URL: http://electrek.co/2024/10/28/new-400-mile-2024-chevy-silverado-ev-work-trucks-now-cost-same-as-used/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T13:24:05Z
Full Content:
A number of Chevrolet dealers across the nation are advertising a new 2024 Silverado EV in 3WT trim at around $60K, which is close to where Hertz is pricing year-old low-mileage examples of the fully electric pickup that are being culled from its rental fleet. At $74,900, including destination, the Silverado EV 3WT is perhaps a bit pricey. Fortunately, Chevrolet is offering its $7500 Ultium Promise Bonus Cash on all 2024 Silverado EV work trucks. That incentive cuts the cost of the 3WT down to $67,400 before tax and license, which seems reasonable considering it has a 393-mile range that bests other $70K electric pickups and is equipped with a host of comfort and safety features that contradict the bare-bones implication of its “work truck” moniker. We’ve been tracking dealer discounts on the Silverado EV in our Electric Vehicle Price Guide ever since the work truck first popped up in dealer inventories on the east coast a couple of months ago. Deep discounts and broadening availability are now making the Silverado EV 3WT much more attractive to shoppers. At the top of our list of discounts is Victorville Chevrolet, a dealership eighty miles northeast of Los Angeles that is advertising $19,500 off MSRP on its Silverado EV work trucks, pricing the 3WT at just $55,400. That’s two to three grand less than a previous rental with over 5000 miles on the odo. For buyers hoping to spend less than $50K, Victorville has a couple of Silverado EV 3WT work trucks with the 1FL Fleet Option priced at $49,400. The 1FL Fleet Option swaps the ruggedly attractive gloss-black aluminum rims for utilitarian-looking steel wheels. It also deletes the side steps, dual-level charge cord, and soft-top tonneau that come with the 3WT trim level. If these prices appeal to you, act quickly. Victorville Chevy’s Silverado EV inventory seems to be depleting fast as they’ve systematically increased their discount over the past several weeks. When we updated Silverado EV discounts on our Electric Vehicle Price Guide at the beginning of this month, Victorville’s online inventory showed a total of 35 electric work trucks in stock. As of this writing, less than a dozen remain, including one in 4WT trim that boasts an impressive 450-mile range. Angelenos that can’t make the trek to Victorville Chevy in time to grab one of their remaining Silverado EVs may want to consider contacting Penke Chevrolet in Cerritos about their in-stock electric work trucks listed at $15,500 off MSRP. If that doesn’t pan out, other LA-area Chevy dealers are showing 2024 Silverado EV work trucks in-transit, some already with modest discounts applied, so an increased supply may drive in-town prices lower in the near future. Outside of southern California, dealers with Silverado EV work truck discounts worth considering include Koons Chevrolet in Maryland ($15,395 off MSRP), Bomnin Chevrolet in Florida ($14,000 off MSRP), Raymond Chevrolet in Illinois and Platinum Chevrolet in northern California ($13,500 off MSRP), Capitol Chevrolet in Texas ($12,900 off MSRP), Parks Chevrolet in Virginia ($12,777 off MSRP), McLoughlin Chevrolet in Oregon ($12,743 off MSRP), and Hendrick Chevrolet in Georgia ($12,500 off MSRP). Look for discounts on a Chevrolet Silverado EV in your area. Dealer discounts on the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning are starting to turn heads, especially those that qualify for the $7500 Federal EV Tax Credit. For example, Al Packer Ford in Florida has an F-150 Lightning XLT with a standard battery (240-mile range, MSRP $60,090) discounted by a whopping $8602. Stacking the $7500 Federal EV tax credit on top of that discount results in a net cost of just $43,988 before tax and license. For those that need more range, Ford of San Leandro in California is advertising an F-150 Lightning Flash (MSRP $71,185) at a $6500 discount, resulting in a $57,774 net cost after applying the $7500 Federal EV tax credit. The Flash trim includes an extended range battery that’s good for 320 miles on a full charge. Find a great deal on a Ford F-150 Lightning near you.

Title: These Five Stocks Are Hedge-Fund Favorites

Toyota employees assembling a car during the pandemic. Toyota is among the stocks held by notable ... [+] hedge funds. (Photo by FRANCOIS LO PRESTI/AFP via Getty Images) Many of the United States’ most talented stock pickers choose to work at hedge funds, where salaries and bonuses are often more attractive than at bank trust departments or mutual funds. Gurufocus.com publishes a screen of stocks that are popular with leading hedge funds. For this column, I took that screen and added two modifications. First, to pass my modified screen, a stock had to be cheap, selling for less than 15 times earnings. Second, the company had to show earnings growth of at least 5% a year for the past ten years, five years, three years and one year – in other words, some consistency to growth. Five stocks that made it through this gauntlet look particularly appealing to me. Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) sold 11.2 million vehicles last year, making the Japanese company the world’s largest car maker for four years in a row. The runner-up, Volkswagen Group, sold 9.2 million vehicles. Toyota’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) sell for about seven times earnings. That’s cheap compared to most stocks, but about par for the course for an automaker. Over the past ten years, Toyota has increased its earnings by an average of more than 7% per year. Its return on stockholders equity lately has been 15%, compared to a ten-year average of about 11%. Homebuilders have one big tailwind and one big headwind at the moment. The tailwind is that there’s pent-up demand for houses. The headwind is that mortgage rates are onerous. Now that the Federal Reserve has switched from raising interest rates to cutting them, I hope that mortgage rates will come down a peg or two. That should help the homebuilders, who are already making pretty good money. D.R. Horton is the largest U.S. homebuilder by sales, and builds homes at a variety of price points. Over the past ten years, it has increased its revenue by 18% a year, and profits even faster. The stock seems reasonably priced to me at 12 times earnings. Loews Corp. is a conglomerate controlled by the Tisch family. Jonathan Tish is chairman, and James Tisch (his cousin) is president and chief executive officer. Insiders, including the Tisches, own 25% of the stock; the public owns the rest. The Tisches like to buy and sell major assets. In the past, Loews owned a big stake in CBS television, all of Lorillard Tobacco Co., Bulova Watch Co., and the Loews movie theatre chain. Nowadays, Loews has four major parts: CNA Financial Corp. (a property & casualty insurer that is 92% owned), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP, and Loews hotels. Wall Street analysts don’t much care for Loews stock. But I think there’s real value in this collection of assets. Do you need a crane? Some earthmoving equipment? A lift truck? These are the sorts of things you can rent or buy from H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES), based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The stock began trading publicly in 2006, and has about 2,300 employees. It has posted a profit in 11 of the past 12 years. The only exception was the pandemic year of 2020. H&E’s return on stockholders’ equity lately has been about 31%. On that measure of profitability, I consider anything north of 15% to be good. H&E has exceeded that mark in (again) 11 of the past 12 years. Only five Wall Street analysts follow the company. Four of them rate it a “buy.” The stock sells for about 13 times earnings. Customers Bancorp (CUBI), based in Reading, Pennsylvania, is parent of Customers Bank, which has branches in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Washington D.C. Jay Sidhu, the bank’s chairman, wrote a book titled “Never Ever, Ever Give Up.” His Son, Sid Sidhu, is the bank’s chief executive officer. Return on assets is my go-to measure for banks. I like to see it above 1.00%. Customers Bancorp has done that for the past three years in a row. In August, the Federal Reserve charged the bank with deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering and risk-management procedures. That helped to knock the stock down from a high near $66 in June to a recent price of about $44. The stock is now quite cheap, at six times earnings. I normally report the results of past recommendations, but this is the first time I’ve written about stocks that are hedge-fund favorites. I’ll detail the results of today’s recommendations in a future column. Disclosure: I own D.R. Horton shares for one client. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Is NVIDIA (NVDA) The Best Performing Large-Cap Stock in the Last 3 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3Y CAGR: 82.08% NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia’s core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company’s biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously. It goes without saying that Nvidia isn’t the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform – CUDA. Having a GPU market share of 70.5% as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date. Nvidia’s highly anticipated GPU – Blackwell – is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months. This is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to say about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs: “People are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications—based on supply chain checks and everything else—demand for this product looks off the charts.” The analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount: “It’s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.” Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Ford Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will release earnings results for its third quarter, after the closing bell on Monday, Oct. 28. Analysts expect the Dearborn, Michigan-based company to report quarterly earnings at 47 cents per share. That’s up from 36 cents per share in the year-ago period. Ford projects to report revenue of $41.88 billion for the recent quarter, compared to $41.22 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. In the meantime, investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Ford currently offers an annual dividend yield of 5.42%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $110,700 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $22,140 per year, you would need $41,805 or around 2,000 shares. To Calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. View more earnings on F How That works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. Ford Outlook, Price Action: Ford CEO Jim Farley recently explained his intent behind driving the Xiaomi SU7 EV over the past six months in a post on social media on Wednesday. "I try to drive everything we compete against," Farley said. "Specs can tell part of a story, but you’ve got to get behind the wheel to truly understand and beat the competition." Ford shares fell 1.5% to close at $11.07 on Friday.

Title: European stocks mostly lower; Philips cuts sales forecast

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Monday, benefiting from increased risk sentiment as crude prices fell, at the start of a week packed with event risks. At 11:05 ET (15:05 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the FTSE 100 in the U.K. climbed 0.4%, and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7%. Sentiment has received a boost Monday from the cooling geopolitical situation in the Middle East after weekend airstrikes by Israel against Iran did not target oil or nuclear facilities as feared. “The more targeted response from Israel leaves the door open for de-escalation,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “While it is still unclear if or how Iran may retaliate, the government has downplayed the damage caused by Israel’s response.” Elsewhere, Monday has been thin on economic data releases, but investors will looking forward to the release of eurozone third-quarter GDP and inflation later in the week to guide how aggressively the European Central Bank will cut interest rates going forward. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates three times already this year, all by 25 basis points, but speculation is growing that ECB policymakers will agree to a larger rate cut at the next meeting. Data released earlier Monday showed that Ifo's indicator for German export expectations fell to minus 6.7 points in October from minus 6.5 points the prior month, with the automotive and metal sectors anticipating the heaviest losses in international trade. Britain's new Labour government also unveils its first budget on Wednesday, while Friday sees the release of the widely-watched monthly official jobs report in the US. There are more quarterly corporate earnings to digest in Europe this week, with results from Philips (AS:PHG) Monday’s highlight. The Dutch medical devices maker's stock slumped 17% after the company lowered its sales forecast for the year due to declining demand in China, which pushed its order intake down 2% in the third quarter. Philips now expects comparable sales to grow by 0.5% to 1.5% in 2024, down from a previous expectation of 3% to 5%. A lot of the week’s attention, however, will be on the results from five of the "Magnificent Seven" US tech stocks that have played an outsize role in driving market gains over the past couple of years. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is due to report on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday. Oil prices fell sharply Monday after Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran over the weekend avoided Tehran's oil and nuclear facilities, easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. By 11:05 ET, the Brent contract dropped 5.1% to $71.78 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 5.2% lower at $68.03 per barrel. Traders had feared that any attacks on Iran’s oil and nuclear infrastructure would mark a dire escalation in the conflict, potentially disrupting oil supplies from the crude-rich region. Iran downplayed the impact of the attack, but still threatened retaliation. The strike saw traders price out a risk premium from crude prices, and put focus back squarely on demand, which is expected to weaken in the coming months.

U.S. stock futures are higher as investors prepare for big tech earnings this week; McDonald's (MCD) is bringing its Quarter Pounders back to more than 900 restaurants following an E. coli outbreak; Boeing (BA) announces a $19 billion capital raise amid a costly strike; U.S.-listed shares of Philips (PHG) are plunging as the Dutch conglomerate lowers its full-year sales outlook on a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand; and crude futures are sinking after an Israeli strike on Iran spared the country's oil facilities. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher as investors prepare for a busy week of earnings and economic data. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) all report quarterly earnings this week, and the tech giants have helped the Nasdaq post gains for seven straight weeks and advance 0.7% in premarket trading Monday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% after delivering losses in each session last week, while S&P 500 futures also are higher, by 0.5%. Gold is trading lower, while bitcoin is up about 1%. McDonald's (MCD) will bring its Quarter Pounders back to the menu in more than 900 restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming, as well as portions of nine other states, after an E. coli outbreak last week. Company officials identified slivered onions from distributor Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility as the likely source, and won't be serving them on the burger when sales resume there. The news comes ahead of McDonald's third-quarter earnings Tuesday, with analysts expecting revenue to rise but profits to drop slightly. Shares of McDonald's are up by 1% in premarket trading. Boeing (BA) announced it will seek to raise more than $19 billion in capital through public offerings of common stock and depositary shares. The aircraft maker will offer 90 million shares of common stock, which at its most recent closing price of $155.01 would be valued at $13.95 billion, as well as $5 billion in depositary shares. Boeing will use the funding for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt it said. The move comes as Boeing has been struggling with a strike by its union machinists that has lasted more than six weeks. Shares of Boeing initially rose on the news but are now 1% lower in premarket trading. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Koninklijke Philips (PHG) are 17% lower in premarket trading after the Dutch conglomerate cut its 2024 sales outlook amid a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand. Philips said it now expects 2024 comparable sales growth between 0.5% and 1.5%, down from its previous forecast of between 3% and 5%. The company's third-quarter revenue, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) all came in lower than estimates from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Oil prices are sinking after Israel avoided hitting energy facilities in its latest strike on Iran. Israel struck several Iranian military facilities Saturday in retaliation for an earlier attack by Iran, but did not disrupt its oil operations. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are falling by almost 6% to trade at around $67.60 a barrel, while Brent crude is down more than 5% at $71.40 a barrel. Iran makes up about 4% of the global oil trade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Monday Tee Up: Mag 7, Jobs, Inflation This week and next are perhaps the biggest two weeks of the year for Wall Street. This week, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings and there is important data on jobs and inflation. Next week features the U.S. presidential election and a Federal Reserve rate decision. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was lower by 2.7%, the S&P 500 lost 1.0%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.2%. For the year, the Dow is higher by 12%, the S&P is up 22%, and the Nasdaq has popped 23%. The earnings calendar is packed this week. On Monday, Ford and V.F. Corp. report results. On Tuesday, Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, McDonald's, Pfizer, Visa, and Electronic Arts. On Wednesday, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Starbucks, Booking Holdings, MGM Resorts, Eli Lilly, and Amgen. On Thursday, Apple, Amazon, Merck, Comcast, Uber, MasterCard, Altria, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. And on Friday, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Charter Communications. So far, 181 (36%) of the S&P 500 companies have reported. Earnings are coming in 4.4% higher than in the prior-year quarter. That follows a strong 13% rise in earnings for 2Q. Argus forecasts about 5%-7% growth in earnings this quarter. For full year, we forecast roughly a 7%-9% gain. For 3Q, we expect Information Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare to be the sectors that shine. On the economic calendar, the October jobs report comes out on Friday.

Title: Watch These CrowdStrike Price Levels After Delta Files Lawsuit Over July IT Outage
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-crowdstrike-price-levels-after-delta-files-lawsuit-over-july-it-outage-8735118
Time Published: 2024-10-28T11:12:23Z
Full Content:
CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares are in the spotlight after Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Friday filed a lawsuit against the cybersecurity provider following a faulty software update in July that brought its operations to a standstill and caused mass flight cancellations. The Atlanta-based airline alleges that the incident, which also disrupted industries including banks, health care, and media outlets, cost it more than $500 million, along with loss of future revenue and reputational damage. Despite ongoing concerns of further litigation linked to the software update, CrowdStrike shares have gained around 50% from their early-August low as of Friday’s close amid growing consensus among analysts that the firm sits poised to move past the incident in a strong position. Below, we analyze the technicals on CrowdStrike’s chart and point out key price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming out in early August, CrowdStrike shares have oscillated within a rising wedge, a chart pattern featuring two upward sloping converging trendlines that signals weakening price momentum. More recently, the stock has broken below the pattern’s lower trendline, potentially setting the stage for a continuation of the downtrend that started in early July, just weeks before the company’s erroneous software update. The stock was little changed at around $300 in premarket trading Monday. Let’s identify four important lower price levels on CrowdStrike’s chart that may come into play if the shares continue their move lower from current levels. Upon an initial move lower, investors should monitor the $285 level, an area just above the 50-day moving average where the shares could encounter support near a trendline joining multiple peaks and troughs on the chart from January to August. A close below this level could see the shares decline to around $262. Investors may view this location on the chart as a buying opportunity, given it sits near a horizontal line linking a series of simar trading levels between December and September. Further selling in the stock opens the door for a bearish move down to the $244 region, where the price could attract support near the January pullback low and prominent early September trough. Finally, a longer-term downtrend could see the shares revisit lower support at $172, where bargain hunters may look to place buy limit orders around the September 2023 swing high and October 2023 swing low. This area on the chart also roughly aligns with a bars pattern downside price target that takes the stock’s sharp trend lower from July to August and repositions it from this month’s swing high.

Title: The hurdle to turning OpenAI into a for-profit company: Deciding what it’s worth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. OpenAI and its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT), are discussing how to divide up the spoils of the artificial intelligence upstart when OpenAI becomes a for-profit company, but agreeing on a fair market value for those assets will be a tall task. It all depends on who is doing the math, according to legal experts. "The issue is that there are probably six to 10 different ways to value a company," said Columbia University Business School professor Angela Lee. "And depending on who you ask, and my guess is, depending on which model you use, you could be off by a factor of like 3x to 5x." Arriving at a precise valuation for the startup responsible for ChatGPT will be nearly impossible, added Case Western Reserve University corporate law professor Anat Alon-Beck. "I suggest that any valuation in this context should be treated as a range rather than a definitive figure, given the inherent uncertainties," Alon-Beck said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that OpenAI and Microsoft hired Wall Street investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to advise them on these discussions after OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round valuing it at $157 billion. Microsoft, among the investors in the latest funding round, has now devoted a total of nearly $14 billion to OpenAI since 2019. The question is how much equity Microsoft should receive in a new for-profit OpenAI in exchange for that $14 billion. There are also other thorny questions about rights to future profits that need to be ironed out. These issues are being debated while the bonds between the two companies start to show signs of wear, according to reporting in The New York Times, as financial pressures, executive exits, and disagreements among employees take their toll. OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion this year, according to the Times. OpenAI’s current implied valuation of $157 billion would put it on par with the market caps of some of America’s largest and best-known companies, including Goldman, the Wall Street giant offering OpenAI advice during the talks with Microsoft. Goldman is currently valued just north of $160 billion. Lee said there are understandable justifications for OpenAI's $157 billion valuation, but critics could reasonably argue the figure is off base. "When talking about hyper-growth companies like Open AI, we are basing it off what it could be valued in five to 10 years," Lee said. "So you don't have performance. You're basing it off potential, and that's why this is so difficult." Arguments can be made for or against a higher or lower number. On one hand, OpenAI’s in-demand industry of artificial intelligence and its meteoric pace of growth both justify pushing up its valuation, according to Lee. On the other hand, she said, its business model hasn’t shown a path to profitability, losing roughly $1 billion per year. That, coupled with a market that’s been slow for dealmaking, should drive down the price, Lee added. Alon-Beck said "information asymmetry" and legal compliance requirements to switch from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity also make traditional valuation techniques less reliable. "The organization’s proprietary models, algorithms, and decision-making processes are not fully transparent to potential investors," Alon-Beck said, and that could cause investors to overestimate or underestimate the value. The reclassification to a for-profit structure would be yet another seismic shift for OpenAI, upending the way it was established nearly a decade ago. It began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits. Things got more complicated in 2019 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his team created a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital — including the billions from Microsoft. It was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power. The inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023 when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later. In the aftermath, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI’s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny. What could make these negotiations even more challenging for OpenAI is that unfair compensation to the nonprofit could expose OpenAI to legal challenges, according to Rose Chan Loui, founding executive director of the University of California Los Angeles's Lowell Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. State attorney generals, particularly in Delaware where the nonprofit is registered, could file suit against parties that violate that legal requirement. "One question the investment bankers have to ask is how realistic people are about the valuation … even the negotiation," she said. "I'm wondering who's going to speak for the nonprofit because the other side might have incentive to devalue it." On top of that, Chan Loui said, fair market value would typically include a premium to the nonprofit for giving up future participation and majority control. Microsoft, legal experts said, should be prepared for significant ongoing outlays to transition away from a nonprofit model, as more money will be needed for the valuation work, legal compliance, and operational integration. OpenAI has said it would seek to become a public benefit corporation (PBC), which is required to balance shareholder interests with broader societal benefits. "Microsoft’s financial exposure is not limited to its initial investment," Alon-Beck said. Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed.

Title: Alphabet's Q3 revenue growth likely to slow as competition pressures Search, YouTube

Business Alphabet will likely post its slowest revenue growth in four quarters on Tuesday, hurt by competition that weighed on its core Google Search business and dented YouTube ad spending. The slowdown in its core business is expected to overshadow AI-driven gains at its cloud-computing business in the third quarter. This quarter was also the company's first since Anat Ashkenazi took over as finance chief from Ruth Porat. Alphabet's long-established dominance of the digital ad market is under threat from the likes of Amazon and TikTok that have become popular with advertisers looking to tap a ready pool of buyers. The other risk Alphabet faces is from regulators who are considering breaking up Google to loosen what they call its "illegal monopoly" on online search. Analysts expect Google Search and other related revenue to grow 11.6 per cent in the third quarter, slower than the 13.8 per cent increase in the second quarter, according to Visible Alpha. "New entrants like Perplexity and ChatGPT are raising billions of dollars on the premise that search can now be disrupted; Google has been seen as slow, unprepared ... to the development of GenAI," MoffettNathanson analysts said. "Some of this negative narrative will be hard to disprove in the coming year," the analysts said, adding that they expect significant changes in Google's ability to maintain its exclusive search advantage on Apple and Android phones in the United States. In a report earlier this month that raised alarm bells among investors, research firm eMarketer said Google's share of U.S. search advertising revenue was set to fall below 50 per cent next year for the first time in at least 18 years. Amazon's search advertising revenue share in the U.S. is expected to grow to 24 per cent next year, while generative AI rivals such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI are also snatching some ad dollars from Google. Google is working to improve the effectiveness of its tools. It has started showing ads in the AI-generated summaries it has begun placing at the top of search results, a move that analysts believe may help stave off competition. Alphabet's shares fell nearly 9 per cent in the three months to September, marking their largest quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2022. But they have risen 17 per cent so far this year. Overall, Alphabet's revenue is expected to have increased 12.6 per cent in the third quarter to $86.31 billion, slower than the 13.6 per cent growth in the second quarter, according to analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. YouTube is also expected to have suffered from some marketers shifting spending to ad-supported tiers of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. YouTube revenue likely rose 11.5 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the second quarter. Despite the deceleration, analysts from Truist expect YouTube, especially YouTube TV, to have benefited from a boost in political ad spending in the third quarter. Google Cloud, a bright spot, is set to record faster growth of 29.2 per cent, the biggest jump in seven quarters, as customers increased their spending on its AI services, including the Vertex AI platform that allows businesses to use the company's models as well as develop their own custom models. Alphabet warned in July that capital expenses would remain high this year as it invested in AI to keep up with rivals. Google's cloud peers have also flagged higher capital expenditures as they too rush to enhance their offerings with AI. Amazon's cloud business revenue likely rose 19.3 per cent in the September quarter, while revenue from Microsoft's cloud unit is expected to have risen around 11 per cent. Investors will look for what Chief Financial Officer Ashkenazi does to keep other costs in check. BofA analysts said with her appointment, there was "potential for the company to 'surprise' with further self-help cost cutting actions after limited layoffs in 2024."

Our hands-on experience gives us confidence in recommending this tool, as we know its strengths and limitations firsthand. To learn more about this plugin, you can read our full WPForms review. If you’re a non-tech-savvy restaurant owner or local entrepreneur, don’t worry. WPForms makes creating an online order form in WordPress easy with its drag-and-drop builder, a feature that allows you to customize forms without coding. What’s more, the plugin offers ready-made templates like the ‘Billing / Order Form,’ which includes fields for customer details. Speaking of order form templates, we were particularly impressed by the tool’s 141 ready-made templates in the ‘Order’ subcategory. In our opinion, this shows WPForms’ commitment to user-friendliness, especially with specific forms for takeout orders, t-shirt sales, and various service bookings. For more information, feel free to check out our guide on how to make an online order form. When it comes to eCommerce integration, WPForms goes the extra mile. Whether you’re offering memberships, online courses, or digital products, it works really well with 12 powerful eCommerce tools. They include WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, Shopify, and MemberPress. If you want, you can also integrate WPForms with Constant Contact for email marketing automation and Advanced Coupons to manage discount codes and promotions. On top of that, you can connect it to payment processors like PayPal and Stripe. This allows customers to pay directly through the form, making it easy to manage orders and payments for your business. For more details, you might want to see our guide on how to create a WordPress form with payment options. Another great feature that WPForms offers is customizable email notifications. These let you alert your team of new orders and send automatic receipts to customers for confirmation. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the WPForms plugin: WPForms is the best online form builder with over 2000 templates, flexible customization, and built-in spam protection. It also has advanced features like automated workflows. Pricing: WPForms lets you start for free with WPForms Lite, which includes basic templates and integrations. To access more features, you will need to upgrade to the premium version starting at $39.60 per year. If you want to sell just one product on your site, then you don’t need a full-fledged online store or a fancy shopping cart. Instead, you can create a simple order form for customers to fill out. WP Simple Pay, a top Stripe plugin for WordPress, lets you set all this up. Feel free to get more information about the platform in our complete WP Simple Pay review. Unlike many Stripe plugins, WP Simple Pay doesn’t charge an extra 3% fee on transactions, which we think is a huge plus! Also, while it has a strong reputation for its integration with Stripe, it also supports more than 10 payment gateways. After installing, you’ll follow a simple setup wizard to connect your Stripe account. You’ll then easily find a template to fit your needs. This lets you create a form that matches your business without starting from scratch. Then, we found WP Simple Pay’s Stripe automatic tax calculation to be very handy. It’s based on where your customers are, which helps you save time and stay compliant so you can focus more on your business. When it comes to inventory management, this plugin also makes it easy. During our research, we discovered that WP Simple Pay automatically shows or hides forms based on stock levels, which helps you maintain customer trust by preventing sales of out-of-stock items. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the WP Simple Pay plugin: Based on our findings, WP Simple Pay’s user-friendly templates, automatic features, and easy integration with Stripe make it a great choice for anyone looking to sell products online. That said, it can also be a streamlined option if you only want to sell a single product. Pricing: Stripe Payment Forms by WP Simple Pay offers a free option, but it charges a 3% transaction fee. To remove this fee and unlock more features, you can upgrade to a premium plan starting at $49.50 per year for the Personal plan. Formidable Forms, in general, is a great choice for creating advanced forms like quizzes, calculators, and custom designs. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it’s also great for building online order forms, which is why we included it on our list. We have tested it thoroughly to learn about all its features. You can learn more in our complete review of Formidable Forms. During setup, we found that Formidable Forms offers 16 online order form templates for creating simple payment forms. Then, it lets users collect payments through popular gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net. When creating the order form, you might want to include a ‘Summary’ field. We like how it provides an automatic overview of the order, which can help boost user experience. Plus, we appreciate Formidable Forms’ compatibility with WooCommerce. It also supports extra integrations with Zapier and Mailchimp.

The automatic order summary feature significantly enhances the user experience. Plus, its compatibility with WooCommerce opens up even more eCommerce possibilities.

It’s a solid choice for those on a budget who need professional online forms for their small business or blog. Ninja Forms is one of the best plugins for handling complex calculations, making it perfect for managing online orders. It also integrates with many different CRM platforms, so it’s ideal for customer management. While we don’t use it on our site, we have researched and tested this plugin to see if it lives up to its reputation. For more details, you can read our complete Ninja Forms review. When exploring its features, we were surprised to find only 2 ready-made form templates for accepting online payments. Even though it can be more time-consuming, there’s also a blank canvas option to create your online order form from scratch. The good news is that we discovered that you can activate various payment add-ons for PayPal, Stripe, Authorize.net, and Elavon. Then, depending on your chosen gateway, you can also offer options like ‘buy now, pay later‘ and accept payments through popular services like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Venmo. When it comes to simplifying your workflow, Ninja Forms offers automation integrations with Webhooks and Zapier. We also found that it excels in CRM platform integration, allowing you to manage customer data effectively. Based on our findings, it looks like Ninja Forms works well with Salesforce CRM, HubSpot CRM, Zoho CRM, and more. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Ninja Forms plugins: Our overall impression was that Ninja Forms is a solid choice for anyone looking to streamline their online order process. It has flexible payment options and works great with different CRM platforms. Plus, its automation features with Webhooks and Zapier make it super easy to manage customer data. Pricing: You can download the free Ninja Forms plugin from WordPress, which is ideal for multiple websites. The pro plan starts at $99 per year, allowing unlimited forms and submissions, plus access to more add-ons and integrations with popular email services like ConvertKit and Constant Contact. Like Formidable Forms, Gravity Forms is a popular choice for building complex WordPress order forms. However, the main difference is that Gravity Forms has a much higher number of CRM integrations for managing customer data. Although we don’t use it on our website, we downloaded and thoroughly tested Gravity Forms to check if it deserves the hype. Here’s our full Gravity Forms review if you want to learn more about this plugin. During setup, we found 3 pre-made templates you can use to create an online order form. They are ‘Ecommerce PayPal Form Template,’ ‘Ecommerce Stripe Form Template,’ and ‘Ecommerce Form Template.’ Gravity Forms works with popular payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net, and Mollie. With its Payment add-ons, you can sell digital downloads or physical products easily. We also discovered that you can handle one-time and recurring payments. When testing Gravity Forms, one feature that stood out was its ‘Dynamic Population’ field. This lets customers pre-fill fields like a phone number or email if they already have that info. It makes filling out forms easier and helps reduce the chances of people abandoning their orders. Now, do note that Gravity Forms’ Pro plan costs $159 a year, and it includes eCommerce add-ons you might need for all these to work. If you’re already using CRMs like Zoho or Capsule, this plan has just what you need to keep things running smoothly. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Gravity Forms plugin: Overall, Gravity Forms is a powerful choice for managing payments and making it easier for customers to shop on your WordPress site. Pricing: Gravity Forms is a premium plugin that doesn’t offer a free version or trial, but you can try it through an online demo. It has three pricing plans designed for various business needs. The ‘Basic’ plan costs $59 per year, allowing unlimited forms and submissions. For a completely free order order form plugin, Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce could be your best bet. This plugin is exclusive to WooCommerce users only. So if you’re not using the platform, then this tool won’t work for you. We also don’t use it on our blog or brand websites. But we tested it extensively to see all its features, and we believe it’s a great option for adding an online order form to a WooCommerce store. During testing, we learned that Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce allows you to set up bulk order forms using a simple questionnaire: In this section, you can set the maximum number of items for customers to bulk order. Then, if there are products you don’t want to be available for bulk orders, you can easily exclude these products using their IDs. What’s more, you can also display specific product categories that are relevant for bulk ordering. We really like these features, as they help prevent lost profits. There’s also an Ajax-based product search to help users find what they need faster. If you want, you can display or hide the price on the bulk order form. When it comes to embedding the bulk order form, just use the shortcode [wcbulkorder] on a WordPress page, and you’re good to go. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce plugin: After testing this plugin, we think it’s a great free option for WooCommerce users wanting to simplify their ordering process. You can tailor forms and exclude specific products to maximize profits. Pricing: Free to download and use from the WordPress plugin directory. When it comes to online order forms, our top choices are WPForms, WP Simple Pay, and Formidable Forms. WPForms is hands-down the best form builder we’ve used on WPBeginner. It’s user-friendly and offers 141 ready-made order form templates.

It provides 16 order form templates and supports popular payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe.

Title: Nike’s CEO climbed from intern to the corner office. Here are 11 Fortune 500 CEOs who did the same—and how long it took

Employees stay at the same company for just under four years on average. That number shrinks considerably for millennials, who, by some estimates, remain with an employer for just under three years on average. There are arguments in favor of and against job-hopping. On the one hand, job-hopping allows professionals to pick up new skills, expand their responsibilities, and more quickly propel them to executive positions. Starbucks’ new CEO Brian Niccol, for instance, held jobs at Procter & Gamble, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell before reaching the corner office at Chipotle. On the other hand, moving up within a company allows leaders to gain a deeper understanding of the organization, develop strong internal networks, and capitalize on their reputation. Although it’s increasingly become rare among younger professionals, staying at the same company for one’s entire career does still occur. Nike CEO Elliott Hill is among the latest Fortune 500 chief executives to climb his way from an entry-level role to the corner office. Fortune compiled a list of current Fortune 500 executives who’ve spent their careers at the same company. It took these CEOs, on average, a little over 33 years to climb from the most junior position to CEO. Many held strategy and operations roles along the way, as well as tech roles. Many also led high-visibility projects, oversaw company-wide transformations and M&A deals, and sought out new ways to streamline business processes. Several large companies that are not on the Fortune 500 also boast chief executives or presidents who spent their entire careers there. EY CEO Janet Truncale began her 33-year career at the consulting firm as an intern in 1991 and was elevated to the corner office in July 2024. Similarly, Roger Goodell joined the NFL in 1982 as an administrative intern. He became NFL commissioner in 2006. Bob Iger, Walt Disney CEO How long it took to become CEO: 31 years Disney deems itself “the greatest place on earth.” Iger seems to agree based on his 50-year tenure at the company. Iger kicked off his career at the Mouse House in 1974 as a self-described “not very good” weatherman for ABC in Ithaca, N.Y. After Disney acquired ABC in 1996, it appointed Iger to its senior management team as chairman of the broadcast company. Four years later, he became Disney’s president and chief operating officer and took the helm as CEO in 2005. Iger briefly retired in 2020 but returned to the corner office in Nov. 2022 after the ouster of his hand-picked heir, Bob Chapek. Iger credits his success at Disney to three things: hard work, great mentors, and great luck. He also stated that it’s more important to be respected as a boss than to be popular. “If you try to run a popularity contest, then you don’t make the tough decisions. I think you have to be fair, accessible, and communicative—but popularity is not one of them,” he said at Bloomberg’s Global Business Forum in 2019. Rodney McMullen, Kroger CEO How long it took to become CEO: 36 years McMullen’s adventures at Kroger began in 1978 as a part-time stock clerk in Lexington, Ky., while in college. He jokes that he had a Kroger scholarship. “I just had to work 32 hours a week to get it.” Before his CEO appointment in 2014, he was named the supermarket chain’s CFO in 1995, where he led the $13 billion Fred Meyer merger. He took on the role of executive vice president of strategy, planning, and finance in 2000, was elected to the board of directors in 2003, and became president and COO in 2009. Former Kroger CEO David Dillon said in the announcement of McMullen’s appointment that the incoming CEO “played a leadership role in every major decision Kroger has made in the past 25 years,” which included the implementation of the Kroger Customer First and Associate First strategy, an effort for the supermarket to better connect with its customers. When hiring, McMullen told The Wall Street Journal that he looks for people who are high energy and eager to learn. They must also be values-driven. Mary Barra, General Motors CEO How long it took to become CEO: 34 years In 1980, Barra joined General Motors at 18 years old as a co-op student on the Pontiac assembly line. She served in numerous director roles, including executive vice president of global product development, where she oversaw all of GM’s suppliers and subsidiaries. GM named her CEO in 2014, the first female CEO in the car industry. Barra has held on to the corner office for more than double the average amount of time for a female Fortune 500 CEO of 4½ years. “You just got to do the right thing and move forward. That’s something I learned very early in my tenure as CEO going through the ignition switch crisis,” Barra told Fortune at the 2024 Most Powerful Women Summit. She noted that the best time to solve a problem is immediately because it rarely gets smaller. Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO How long it took to become CEO: 30 years Walmart hasn’t strayed from the No. 1 spot on the Fortune 500 ranking since McMillon’s CEO appointment in 2014. McMillion joined Walmart in 1984 as an associate, making $6.50 an hour. He held an assistant manager role in Oklahoma while completing his MBA at the University of Tulsa. His career trajectory has seen him serve as the general merchandise manager of Sam’s Club, a subsidiary of Walmart, where he oversaw several divisions. In 2006, he was appointed CEO and president of Sam’s Club. Four years later, he became CEO of Walmart International until his promotion to Walmart CEO in 2014. In his 10 years leading the company, McMillon has grown revenue by $162 billion. The 58-year-old credits his rise at Walmart to constantly raising his hand and volunteering for new projects. “People saw me handling responsibility one level up, which made it easy for them to promote me,” he said at the Duke University Fuqua School of Business distinguished speaker series in 2017. Enrique Lores, HP CEO How long it took to become CEO: 30 years During Lores’s final year of his MBA program in 1989, Hewlett-Packard recruiters visited the school to promote an electrical engineering internship. “[They] were talking about printers like they were the best thing in life,” he joked in 2021. He scored the electrical engineering internship and has been with the company since. Lores has held many leadership roles across functions at the computer company. He’s worked in printing, imaging, sales, system operations roles, and customer support. In 2015, he led HP’s separation from Hewlett-Packard, one of the biggest splits in corporate America’s history. Post-split, he became EMEA president, overseeing sales and performance of these regions. He was tapped for the corner office in late 2019. The true sign of a good leader, he said in a conversation at Santa Clara University, is one with strong values and who knows what they stand for and what their limitations are. John Stankey, AT&T CEO How long it took to become CEO: 35 years Stankey began his career in 1985, immediately after undergrad, at the phone company Pacific Bell. As the phone carrier consolidated, Stankey rose through the ranks and ran parts of SBC Southwestern Bell. He was promoted to chief information officer of the carrier after it merged with AT&T in 2005 and chief technology officer in 2008. Much of Stankey’s pre-CEO experience was in strategy and operations roles. He was named chief strategy officer in 2012, became CEO of AT&T Entertainment Group in 2015, and CEO of WarnerMedia in 2018. In 2019, he was appointed COO and president, a role he held for 10 months before stepping into the corner office. He told Fortune in August that luck and timing, neither of which people have much control over, helped him advance to senior levels. “Do your job and do it well, but don’t let the variables that are related to luck and timing dominate or impact your state of mind … try to be thoughtful and correct as many of the fundamental decisions as you can, but don’t let it paralyze you,” he said. Arvind Krishna, IBM CEO How long it took to become CEO: 30 years Krishna began his career at IBM in 1990 on the Watson research team, now focused on AI technology research, where he remained for 18 years. In 2009, he became general manager of information management software, followed by leadership roles like senior vice president of hybrid cloud in IBM’s research department. He was appointed senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software in 2020, where he was the principal architect in IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat, one of the largest acquisitions in the company’s history. Before his CEO appointment in 2023, Krishna played a key role in developing the company’s key technologies, including AI, cloud, quantum computing, and blockchain, said former IBM chairman Ginni Rometty. Speaking at the Duke University Fuqua School of Business in 2023, Krishna said good leadership is about conviction and making decisions that empower others around a shared goal. “Merit and the right idea do carry a lot of weight. But you’ve got to be persistent, and it’s got to be clear to the organization you are in that you’re not doing it for personal gain … it’s for the betterment of the organization.” Bob Jordan, Southwest Airlines CEO How long it took to become CEO: 34 years When Jordan arrived in Dallas in 1988 to interview for a Southwest Airlines programmer analyst role, he didn’t know much about the company. But during his interview, an employee had an issue with the airline’s computer system that he was able to fix. The company offered him a job the next day. In his first 20 years at the airline, Jordan held several director and vice president roles, including executive vice president of strategy and technology and senior vice president of enterprise spend management, before being promoted to executive vice president of strategy and planning in 2008. In 2011, Jordan was tapped as Southwest’s chief commercial officer, spearheading its 2014 acquisition of AirTrain, a low-cost airline, and the launch of AirTran’s e-commerce platform and reward program. He was named executive vice president of corporate services in 2017 and served in this role until 2022 when he stepped into the corner office. Jordan sat down with Fortune in 2022 to discuss the airline’s post-pandemic bounceback and how he motivates employees to follow his lead after a tumultuous period for those in the travel industry. “You have to demonstrate that you care. Words only go so far,” he said. “I need to be out there making sure I listen, understand what’s happening, engage with our employees, and just be there for them.” Raj Subramaniam, FedEx CEO How long it took to become CEO: 31 years Subramaniam thought getting a job at FedEx was a long shot when, in 1991, he applied as an associate marketing analyst in its international division. It was the middle of a recession, and he’d only just received his MBA. Still, he figured he’d throw his hat in the ring. He got the job. Early in his tenure at the company, Subramaniam was placed on a project heading the company’s international expansion despite being a junior-level employee. “Here I was at the bottom of the pyramid, but saying, ‘Hey, put me in chief,’” he recently told Time. That opportunity gave him visibility at the company, and he was promoted to vice president of marketing in Asia Pacific in 1996. From there, he served as regional president of Canada from 2003 to 2006 and senior vice president of FedEx Services from 2006 to 2013. Subramaniam also served as president and CEO of FedEx Express for three months before his promotion to COO and president in 2019. After three years, he was appointed CEO, becoming just the second chief executive in FedEx’s 53-year history. Subramaniam believes a leader’s job is to build the right leadership team for execution. Once that’s in place, he said, the leader’s job “becomes being able to remove barriers for execution,” Subramaniam told The Conference Board. Ron Vachris, Costco CEO How long it took to become CEO: 42 years Although less than a year in the corner office, Vachris is a Costco veteran. He began as a forklift driver at Price Club, later purchased by Costco, in 1982 at the age of 17. He worked his way up to a store clerk while a student at Glendale Community College in Arizona and was elevated to assistant general manager and general manager positions in Colorado in 1989. Vachris played a sizable role in Costco’s expansion after the company acquired Price Club in 1993, moving back to Arizona to oversee the expansion. He held multiple leadership positions after the merger, including general manager of the Northwest region, senior vice president of real estate, and executive vice president of merchandising. In February 2022, he became the company’s chief operating officer and president before becoming CEO at the beginning of 2024. Earlier this year, Vachris told Fortune that his leadership philosophy is not only customer-centric but also employee-centric. He listens to his underlings and trusts their insights. “You’ve got to give people room to try new things,” he said. Elliott Hill, Nike CEO How long it took to become CEO: 32 years Hill has followed Nike’s directive to “just do it” and become the sports retailer’s newly-minted CEO. In 1988, Hill joined the company as a 19-year-old intern in apparel sales. He spent much of his early career in this division, though he never held a role for more than four years before getting promoted. In 2000, he was promoted to his first vice president role, overseeing sales and retail in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. After serving as vice president and general manager of North America from 2010 to 2013, he was promoted to president of geographies and sales in 2016 before retiring in 2020. At the time of his retirement, he was president of consumer and marketplace, a $39 billion business. The 60-year-old recently came out of retirement to return to Nike after former CEO John Donahoe stepped down following declining sales. Hill said in a recent Nike press release that his immediate goals to get the company back on track include refocusing on the consumer, understanding areas for improvement, and holding each other accountable for delivering on its promise. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Nvidia has lots riding on this week even as earnings a month out

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. isn’t expected to announce earnings for another month, but results this week from the chipmaker’s biggest customers are about to set the tone for its shares, which are trading near an all-time high on optimism around the AI boom. Most Read from Bloomberg The Tartarian Candidate A Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl Inside NYC’s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds Booming Cambridge Exposes England’s Widening Wealth Gap Robotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all announce earnings in the coming days. Traders will be paying close attention to their capital spending to gauge demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are prized for artificial intelligence computing. The group accounted for more than 40% of Nvidia’s sales in the second quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Wall Street expects the four tech giants to unveil a record amount of capital expenditures, but any disappointment around the pace of outlays stands to rattle Nvidia shares, which have almost tripled this year, adding more than $2 trillion in market value. It’s likely to be a pivotal stretch for the entire stock market. Nvidia has been the biggest contributor to the S&P 500 Index’s gains this year, accounting for about a quarter of its 22% advance. “If these companies come out and broadly say that capex is increasing even at a modest rate, that’s what Nvidia really needs to keep this momentum going,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments. “If anything is poor you could see a lot come out of the stock.” The four tech behemoths are projected to have pumped a combined record $56 billion into capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Much of that spending is going to Nvidia and other makers of AI-related gear, and it’s projected to rise further in the coming quarters. All signs point to continued strength in AI-related spending. From chip equipment maker ASML Holding NV to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., AI has been a bright spot this earnings season. That backdrop has helped propel Nvidia shares, along with reassurances from CEO Jensen Huang that production of its new Blackwell chips is on track and in high demand. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the heavy spending on AI computing equipment. The stock hit a record high last week and its market capitalization is now roughly $3.5 trillion, just shy of Apple Inc., which is still the world’s most valuable company. To be sure, there has been some concern around all the spending on AI by the Big Tech companies, given investors’ perception that the billions of dollars the firms have invested has generated relatively little in revenue. So that will be another focus as the cohort announces earnings this week. “You’ve got to walk that fine line of investment,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, so that investors see you’re “not getting too far ahead of yourself.” Nvidia’s revenue is projected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, sales are estimated to increase 44% to $181 billion, in the chipmaker’s fiscal 2026. Of course, there are other beneficiaries of high AI spending for which this week will be important to watch, including Broadcom Inc., Super Micro Computer Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. Top Tech Stories Indonesia blocked Apple Inc. from selling its latest iPhones in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, saying the company has yet to meet local investment requirements. When Meg Whitman was living in California and running first eBay Inc. and then HP Inc., the idea that Africa had some role to play in her businesses rarely crossed her mind. “I literally thought about Africa 1% of my time,” she says. Olympus Corp. pushed out its chief executive officer after investigating an allegation he purchased illegal drugs, a stunning exit for the German native after less than two years at the helm. Hong Kong outlined its first policy guidelines dedicated to the use of AI in finance and floated a tax break for virtual assets, part of efforts to promote itself as an Asian business center.

Title: Bitcoin is better than gold — even as gold hits record highs. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/bitcoin-gold-price-record-investment-bitwise-1851680456
Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:00:00Z

Gold prices have soared to new heights, reaching a record $2,733 per ounce, while Bitcoin is thriving, approaching the $70,000 mark. The rally has been fueled by increased investor demand for safe-haven assets amid the Fed’s rate cuts, China’s stimulus plan, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This has reignited the debate over which asset makes for a better investment: gold or Bitcoin. Bitwise Asset Management, a firm specializing in crypto index funds and ETFs, views Bitcoin and gold as assets with distinct advantages. In an interview with Quartz, Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, explained that while Bitcoin has the potential for higher returns, gold offers greater stability. He emphasized that Bitcoin holds more advantages over gold, particularly in terms of growth potential and long-term utility. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” because it shares several key characteristics with the precious metal. Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply as only 21 million coins will ever be mined, creating a built-in scarcity that many believe will drive its value higher over time. This limited supply introduces a deflationary element, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Additionally, both Bitcoin and gold are decentralized assets. This means they operate independently of central banks or governmental control, making them less susceptible to policy-driven fluctuations. Investors see this as a hedge against economic instability, particularly during times of inflation or market volatility. Consequently, both assets are often viewed as safe havens, providing a store of value when traditional markets experience downturns. Despite the striking similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there are also significant differences, one of which is price volatility. Bitcoin tends to experience far more dramatic price fluctuations than gold, sometimes within a single day. According to Hougan, the role of Bitcoin in an investment portfolio differs fundamentally from that of gold. While both assets can serve as hedges, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it can amplify gains or losses, making it more suitable for investors willing to take on risk for potentially higher rewards. In contrast, gold’s stability offers a more conservative approach, providing steady protection against economic uncertainties. “When you add Bitcoin to a portfolio, it boosts returns without increasing risk, and when you add gold to a portfolio, you get the same return but less risk,” he told Quartz. Hougan pointed out that, despite their similarities and differences, gold and Bitcoin do not have the same impact on an investment portfolio. He used a vivid analogy to illustrate this, comparing the two assets to ingredients in a soup. Adding gold to a portfolio, he explained, is like adding water to a soup—it doesn’t alter the flavor significantly unless a substantial amount is added. Gold’s stability and gradual influence mean it acts as a steadying force, but its effect is subtle unless it forms a large part of the investment mix. In contrast, Hougan likened adding Bitcoin to a portfolio to adding pepper to a soup; even a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Due to its higher volatility and growth potential, Bitcoin can have a pronounced impact on portfolio performance, amplifying returns but also introducing greater risk. This analogy underscores how Bitcoin, despite its smaller allocation, can play a more dynamic and immediate role in an investor’s strategy. In his analysis, Matthew Hougan referenced data from Bitwise that demonstrated how even a modest allocation of Bitcoin—such as 1.0%, 2.5%, or 5.0%—to a traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio could significantly enhance returns while only marginally increasing risk. For instance, a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin was shown to improve overall portfolio returns by as much as 50 percentage points, with only a slight uptick in volatility. This suggests that Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can meaningfully boost portfolio performance, even at low levels of exposure. In contrast, Hougan explained that gold had a more subtle impact on returns. While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component. Over the past 30 years, more than 5,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched across various sectors, but Bitcoin ETFs have outpaced them all, including the highly successful gold ETFs. Following SEC approval and their subsequent debut in January 2024, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a remarkable achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Hougan agreed, stating that Bitcoin is a more effective addition to a portfolio than gold for achieving the goals most investors seek. This year, in addition to Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETFs also received approval from the SEC, raising the likelihood that other crypto ETFs, such as those for XRP and Solana, could soon follow. At the launch of Ether ETFs, Hougan predicted that these exchange-traded products would have an even greater impact on Ethereum than they did on Bitcoin. He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL-0.93%), Nvidia (NVDA-4.20%), Microsoft (MSFT-5.04%), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, while gold has already reached its peak, signaling growing concerns among investors about the stability of traditional fiat currencies and broader economic uncertainties. According to Hougan, this trend underscores a shift in investor sentiment: Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns, making it an attractive option for those seeking growth, while gold remains a go-to asset for those prioritizing stability and preservation of wealth. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Those willing to accept higher volatility for the possibility of greater rewards may lean towards Bitcoin, while more conservative investors might prefer the steady, time-tested security of gold. “Keep your stocks, keep your bonds, but carve out a little space for this new asset [Bitcoin] that provides unique enhancements to your portfolio and has, in our view, significant upside potential,” he added.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Microsoft's Earnings

Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:00:00Z

UPDATE—Oct. 30, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price information. Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report fiscal first-quarter earnings results after markets close Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching growth in the company's Azure cloud computing platform. Analysts expect revenue to jump 14% year-over-year to $64.47 billion. Net income is projected to land at $23.21 billion or $3.11 per share, up from $22.29 billion or $2.99 per share a year earlier. In the prior quarter, Microsoft reported cloud revenue of $36.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, but short of the $37.2 billion analysts expected. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses Azure, accounted for $28.5 billion in revenue, driven by a 29% jump in revenue from Azure and other services. Deutsche Bank analysts said they expect Azure to post a percentage in the low-to-mid 30s for the fiscal first quarter, adding Microsoft “needs to deliver Azure outperformance and guidance for little if any deceleration” in order to satisfy investors' lofty expectations. Microsoft told investors when it reported earnings in July that it would raise its investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in order to meet AI demand. Worries about whether Microsoft's higher spending will pay off weighed on the company's stock price in the wake of the report. Goldman Sachs analysts said they view Microsoft's buildout as a "necessary investment ahead of the structural shift to Gen-AI, which is likely to present a vast revenue opportunity across all layers of the AI technology stack." Microsoft announced several new AI-related features and initiatives in recent weeks, including upgrades to its Copilot AI assistant and autonomous AI agents for Copilot. Shares of Microsoft have gained over 16% since the start of the year, at $437.82 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the company's earnings release.

While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component. Over the past 30 years, more than 5,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched across various sectors, but Bitcoin ETFs have outpaced them all, including the highly successful gold ETFs. Following SEC approval and their subsequent debut in January 2024, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a remarkable achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Hougan agreed, stating that Bitcoin is a more effective addition to a portfolio than gold for achieving the goals most investors seek. This year, in addition to Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETFs also received approval from the SEC, raising the likelihood that other crypto ETFs, such as those for XRP and Solana, could soon follow. At the launch of Ether ETFs, Hougan predicted that these exchange-traded products would have an even greater impact on Ethereum than they did on Bitcoin. He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, while gold has already reached its peak, signaling growing concerns among investors about the stability of traditional fiat currencies and broader economic uncertainties. According to Hougan, this trend underscores a shift in investor sentiment: Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns, making it an attractive option for those seeking growth, while gold remains a go-to asset for those prioritizing stability and preservation of wealth. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Those willing to accept higher volatility for the possibility of greater rewards may lean towards Bitcoin, while more conservative investors might prefer the steady, time-tested security of gold. “Keep your stocks, keep your bonds, but carve out a little space for this new asset [Bitcoin] that provides unique enhancements to your portfolio and has, in our view, significant upside potential,” he added. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The Nittany Lions are in better position than ever to run the table and win the Big Ten. But a familiar foil awaits on Saturday. Intel will report its Q3 earnings after the bell Thursday. Uber stock tanked on Thursday after the ride-hailing giant missed on the all-important gross bookings metric. Microsoft offers Windows 10 users a year of security updates for $30. The company also offered plenty of encouragement for users to migrate to Windows 11. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks tumbled Thursday as investors weighed their hefty AI expenditures against the time it will take to generate a return on their investment. Bitcoin is once again near a new all-time high as investors bet on a boost from the outcome of the presidential election. Having a player named Will Smith on your roster may be the easiest way to win the World Series. It’s full circle for Fizz, the anonymous platform that Solomon started with his Stanford classmate Ashton Cofer before they dropped out to work on the app full-time. Mathur has been working with the young founders since late 2021, when his daughter – also a Stanford student – met Solomon at a party and proclaimed to her father that she had met “the next Mark Zuckerberg.” Fizz isn’t Facebook, and thankfully, Solomon has not yet had to testify for his company’s shortcomings on Capitol Hill.

Title: Bitcoin is better than gold — even as gold hits record highs. Here's why

Gold prices have soared to new heights, reaching a record $2,733 per ounce, while Bitcoin is thriving, approaching the $70,000 mark. The rally has been fueled by increased investor demand for safe-haven assets amid the Fed’s rate cuts, China’s stimulus plan, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This has reignited the debate over which asset makes for a better investment: gold or Bitcoin. Bitwise Asset Management, a firm specializing in crypto index funds and ETFs, views Bitcoin and gold as assets with distinct advantages. In an interview with Quartz, Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, explained that while Bitcoin has the potential for higher returns, gold offers greater stability. He emphasized that Bitcoin holds more advantages over gold, particularly in terms of growth potential and long-term utility. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” because it shares several key characteristics with the precious metal. Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply as only 21 million coins will ever be mined, creating a built-in scarcity that many believe will drive its value higher over time. This limited supply introduces a deflationary element, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Additionally, both Bitcoin and gold are decentralized assets. This means they operate independently of central banks or governmental control, making them less susceptible to policy-driven fluctuations. Investors see this as a hedge against economic instability, particularly during times of inflation or market volatility. Consequently, both assets are often viewed as safe havens, providing a store of value when traditional markets experience downturns. Despite the striking similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there are also significant differences, one of which is price volatility. Bitcoin tends to experience far more dramatic price fluctuations than gold, sometimes within a single day. According to Hougan, the role of Bitcoin in an investment portfolio differs fundamentally from that of gold. While both assets can serve as hedges, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it can amplify gains or losses, making it more suitable for investors willing to take on risk for potentially higher rewards. In contrast, gold’s stability offers a more conservative approach, providing steady protection against economic uncertainties. “When you add Bitcoin to a portfolio, it boosts returns without increasing risk, and when you add gold to a portfolio, you get the same return but less risk,” he told Quartz. Hougan pointed out that, despite their similarities and differences, gold and Bitcoin do not have the same impact on an investment portfolio. He used a vivid analogy to illustrate this, comparing the two assets to ingredients in a soup. Adding gold to a portfolio, he explained, is like adding water to a soup—it doesn’t alter the flavor significantly unless a substantial amount is added. Gold’s stability and gradual influence mean it acts as a steadying force, but its effect is subtle unless it forms a large part of the investment mix. In contrast, Hougan likened adding Bitcoin to a portfolio to adding pepper to a soup; even a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Due to its higher volatility and growth potential, Bitcoin can have a pronounced impact on portfolio performance, amplifying returns but also introducing greater risk. This analogy underscores how Bitcoin, despite its smaller allocation, can play a more dynamic and immediate role in an investor’s strategy. In his analysis, Matthew Hougan referenced data from Bitwise that demonstrated how even a modest allocation of Bitcoin—such as 1.0%, 2.5%, or 5.0%—to a traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio could significantly enhance returns while only marginally increasing risk. For instance, a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin was shown to improve overall portfolio returns by as much as 50 percentage points, with only a slight uptick in volatility. This suggests that Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can meaningfully boost portfolio performance, even at low levels of exposure. In contrast, Hougan explained that gold had a more subtle impact on returns. While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component.

He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL-0.93%), Nvidia (NVDA-4.20%), Microsoft (MSFT-5.04%), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices.

Title: 3 years after turning Facebook into Meta, Mark Zuckerberg's real win is AI

Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:00:00Z

Facebook (META) began as a digital college yearbook, connecting Harvard students face to face. Three years ago on Monday, Mark Zuckerberg rebranded his social media empire as Meta, betting billions on a future where we’d meet in virtual worlds instead. “Today we are seen as a social media company,” Zuckerberg said on Oct. 28, 2021, from the stage at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference. “But in our DNA we are a company that builds technology to connect people, and the metaverse is the next frontier just like social networking was when we got started.” Zuckerberg said he hoped the metaverse would reach a billion people and conduct “hundreds of billions” of dollars worth of commerce, employing millions — all within the decade. Since then, Meta has invested more than $63 billion in Reality Labs, its division for virtual and augmented reality technology. The results include updated Quest headsets, which power Horizon Worlds, a virtual universe where customized avatars (initially designed without legs) roam digital spaces, and a partnership with Ray-Ban to develop AR glasses. These efforts drew skepticism from investors and a lukewarm response from consumers. But everything changed when ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in November 2022. Meta was ready: Its AI research division, led by pioneer Yann LeCun, had long been advancing the field. And while Zuckerberg hasn’t given up on his metaverse dreams, his public messaging has increasingly focused on the transformative potential of generative artificial intelligence. Those AI bets are already paying dividends. In July, Meta reported stronger-than-expected sales, crediting AI improvements in ad targeting. The company is now rolling out AI tools to help marketers enhance their listings. “There are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “It’s because it’s actually super exciting and it’s going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.” He added that AI will “end up affecting almost every product that we have in some way.” The pivot proved timely. After losing almost two-thirds of its value in 2022, Meta’s stock price almost tripled last year and is up more than 60% in 2024, hitting an all-time closing high of $595.94 per share earlier this month. For Meta, the metaverse has dimmed and been replaced by all things AI, according to Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deep Water Management. “They haven’t given up on the metaverse,” he said. “They are doing what every big tech company is doing, which is applying AI everywhere.” Reality Labs will likely lose $20 billion this year, but Munster noted that about 70% of that investment is going toward AI-enabled glasses and wearables rather than Quest headsets. Meta has put at least $10 billion into AI glasses development alone, which has helped put the company ahead of competitors in the space. But Munster said that the company’s “drunken sailor” spending on metaverse projects may not be sustainable alongside the growing costs of generative AI development, which has shown clearer financial benefits. While Meta doesn’t need to completely abandon Reality Labs, Munster said the next couple of years are crucial: Either the hardware needs to advance enough to prove the opportunity is real, or the spending needs to be redirected. “One is going to have to give,” he said. Although the name change happened in 2021, Meta’s investment in the metaverse vision began long before. The company had bought VR headset maker Oculus for $2 billion in 2014 — twice what it paid for Instagram in a blockbuster deal two years earlier. By the time of the Meta rebrand, the company had already invested an estimated $32 billion in metaverse-related technologies. But the “metaverse” itself is often misunderstood, according to Matthew Ball, an entrepreneur and author of “The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything.” While many associate it purely with VR headsets and virtual worlds, Meta’s vision is actually about the evolution of the internet itself into a 3D medium spanning virtual reality, augmented reality, and traditional screens. “The metaverse is not limited to and does not even require virtual reality,” Ball said. “Most people now believe we will use no term to describe it whatsoever — we’ll just call it the 3D internet.” But in the meantime, the proto-3D internet suffers. Global shipments of VR and AR headsets have sank roughly 28% since last September, with growth expected in 2025, according to market researcher IDC. But Meta’s Ray-Ban (EL) smart glasses have found success, with more than 730,000 units sold in their first three quarters, according to CNBC. The second generation of the glasses, which came out in September, got updates like better image quality, improved battery life and an AI voice assistant. Meta’s recent triumph with Ray-Ban smart glasses has paved the way for an even more ambitious project: Orion. This cutting-edge eyewear prototype, which Meta has been developing for almost 10 years, represents a significant leap forward in capability. When Zuckerberg unveiled Orion in September, it sparked an unprecedented wave of excitement about Meta’s metaverse technology — a notable shift from the previously tepid response to the company’s metaverse initiatives. The device showcases how AI could power next-generation augmented reality, with features like real-time 3D mapping and advanced scene understanding. “Without AI, it would be impossible to virtualize the real world, or perhaps build the fantastical ones that we’ve imagined,” Ball said. In October 2021, when The Wall Street Journal started publishing The Facebook Files, exposing the company’s knowledge of its platforms’ harmful effects, Zuckerberg unveiled his metaverse rebrand. This was only a few years after election interference claims around Cambridge Analytica’s data collection on American voters that had Zuckerberg making multiple appearances in front of Congress. At the time, Sara M. Watson, a technology critic and independent industry analyst, called the name change a diversion that didn’t address what the company had already built and broken. Now she sees the same playbook at work as Meta pivots to AI amid tepid response to its metaverse projects. Meta has been aggressive in competing to build cutting-edge AI. In July, Meta revealed Llama 3.1, the first openly available model that the company says competes and, in some cases, beats the performance on benchmarks of several closed AI models, including OpeanAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. When Zuckerberg published a 2,300-word blog post called “Open Source AI Is the Path Forward,” he positioned open models as a public good — while building another ecosystem that could entrench Meta’s power with the same “move fast and break things” approach that led to congressional mea culpas and, ultimately, the name change. If Llama becomes the go-to infrastructure for AI tools, that would give Zuckerberg the same kind of control over generative AI that he once held over social networking, despite Meta’s troubled history with platform power. “You build a thing that everyone needs, and they build on top of that,” Watson said. “Then you become essential no matter how you decide to monetize.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Broadcom (AVGO): Leading with Custom Silicon and Strategic Acquisitions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. 3Y CAGR: 55.87% Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been one of the most profitable stocks in the S&P500 index over the past few years. The company has been very successful in its patent portfolio strategy by acquiring other tech companies by leveraged buyouts. Some of its recent acquisitions include CA Technologies and VMware, with VMware being especially prominent. Further, Broadcom is the biggest player in the custom silicon market that lets other companies design their own AI accelerators, which are increasingly opting for specific chips for specific use cases. Following is what Clearbridge Large Cap Value strategy had to say about AVGO in their Q3, 2024 investor letter: “In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.” Overall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Intel Stock Price Levels to Watch as Struggling Chipmaker's Earnings Loom

Time Published: 2024-10-28T02:33:59Z
Full Content:
Intel (INTC) shares will be in focus this week as investors await the beleaguered chipmaker’s third quarter results after Thursday’s closing bell. Analysts expect the company to report a decline in revenue for the period owing to softening demand for both its PC and server chips as it faces intensifying competition from rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NVDA). Investors will look for further updates from executives about the company’s turnaround plans, which has helped underpin a 23% recovery in the chipmaker’s stock from its early-September low. However, the shares still remain more than 50% lower since the start of the year through Friday’s close, as the company’s dominance in the chip market continues to shrink. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and point out important price levels to watch out for as the chipmaker prepares to report its quarterly results. Since breaking above the neckline of a double bottom on above-average volume last month, Intel shares have remained stuck in a sideways drift, with a doji forming last week—a candlestick pattern that indicates indecision. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) has flattened out in recent weeks, confirming rangebound conditions in the stock. Amid the potential for earnings-driven volatility, let’s outline several important levels on Intel’s chart that investors will likely be watching. Firstly, it’s worth keep an eye on the $22 level. This area on the chart sits just 3% below Friday’s close and has provided support over the past month near the double bottom pattern’s neckline. A decisive breakdown below this region could see the chipmaker’s stock revisit the $19 level, an area where bargain hunters may look for buying opportunities near the August and September double bottom troughs. A breakout above the recent sideways drift may drive a move up to around $25. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower levels in recent months could seek exit points near three prominent swing lows that formed on the chart between October 2022 and February last year. A rally through this level could see the shares climb to $30, a location where the price may run into overhead selling pressure near major peaks and troughs on the chart from November 2022 through to June this year. Finally, a more bullish move may lead to a retest of the $36 level, an area just above the 50-week moving average where investors could decide to lock in profits near a trendline connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between June 2022 and July this year.

Despite the ongoing subdued market mood, Waaree Energies received the strongest subscription response from all sets of investors and also debuted slightly below our expectations. Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to “HOLD” while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts.

If this trend sustains, then Nifty can rise further during the day. We will have to wait and watch. The Nifty could attempt a bounce this week, according to historical patterns for the current week in seasonal data. This week is the 44th week of the calendar year, and a 10-year analysis starting from 2014 indicates that the market has ended higher 80% of the time during this week, with an average gain of 1.4%. In fact, the last time this week ended in the red was eight years ago in 2016. That said, the tactical trend remains down and any bounce on the Nifty will face stiff resistance in the 24,413 - 24,462 area, while support lies at 24,073. Any break below this support will bring the all-important 23,779 into the picture.

Crude oil futures fell Sunday, after widely-anticipated Israeli airstrikes against Iran did not hit crucial oil facilities. After initially dropping more than 5%, West Texas Intermediate crude was down 4.7%, to $68.39 a barrel, as of 9:30 p.m. Eastern, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 4.5% to $72.21. China’s industrial profits plunged in September, recording the steepest monthly decline of the year, official data showed on Sunday, as policymakers ramp up stimulus to revitalise economic growth. Profits in September fell 27.1% from a year earlier, following a 17.8% fall in August, while earnings slipped 3.5% in the first nine months versus a 0.5% rise in the January-August period Japanese stocks rose strongly on Monday as the yen sank to a three-month low after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s coalition lost its parliamentary majority in a drubbing in Sunday’s election, raising uncertainty over the path for policy and the economy. Other Asian markets were mostly in the green on Monday morning. Nifty ended on a weak note on October 25 near two and half month lows despite the last hour bounce. It fell for the fifth consecutive session. It closed lower for the fourth consecutive week falling 2.71% over the week. Indian markets have fallen on all days of the week reeling under FPI selling pressure, weak Q2 results from most corporates and rising treasury yields in the US. Though a bounce in the markets is overdue, it needs reversal of selling pressure from FPIs and some sentiment stability in the local investor community. Nifty could now take support from 23892 while 24378 could prove to be tough to breach on the up in the near term. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “A significant market trend during the recent days of market correction is the flight to quality. While the Nifty corrected by 8.3% from the recent peak, the mid and small cap indices corrected by 9.8% and 9.3% respectively from their recent peaks. Actually the index movements conceal the carnage in the mid and smallcaps where the correction has been above 30% in dozens of stocks and even by more than 40% in some momentum stocks. It is important to know that many largecaps are steady in this volatile market. The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations. The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices. The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets.” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Nifty outlook: With Friday’s closing hour managing to push Nifty above the initial two hour’s close when the selling intensity was at its highest, we now have initial signs of a reversal. The August low of 23894 will thus act as a downside marker for all upside attempts. However, we also expect rejection trades to resurface on pull back to 24350. Derivative outlook: Nifty weekly contract has highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts while monthly contracts have highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts.

Despite this, sentiment remains cautious, influenced by sustained FII selling and weak earnings, said Ajit Mishra, SVP at Religare Broking. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have sold ₹1,02,931 crore in October, impacting market momentum. The dollar index rallied for the fourth consecutive week and is keeping intact the overall uptrend. The index has risen breaking above the resistance at 104. It closed the week at 104.25, up 0.74 per cent. A strong rise in the US Treasury yields is aiding the greenback to retain its strength. Markets turning slightly cautious ahead of the US Presidential Election next month is also giving the dollar a safe-haven support. The uptrend is strong, and we expect the rally in the dollar to continue for another couple of weeks until the outcome of the US elections is known. Sudarshan Chemical (SCIL) announced a large acquisition of Germany-based Heubach Group at a highly discounted valuation on October 11. The speciality chemicals player manufactures colour pigments and is the largest domestic player. While the leap the company has made is commendable and at the opportune moment, investors may hold the stock till further details emerge. The roadmap in turning around the acquisition, part of which turned insolvent, and incremental growth from the acquisition need to be articulated by the company before investing in the stock. The stock trading at 28 times one-year forward earnings also captures the deal enthusiasm and the company prospects in the long term. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Inox Wind and Trent Nifty 50 (24,181) and Bank Nifty (50,787) depreciated 2.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent last week. The former posted a weekly loss for the fourth time in a row, indicating strong selling pressure. Here, we analyse derivatives data of both indices. The sharp decline on Friday has changed the outlook to negative for the stock of IndusInd Bank (₹1,041.60). Support levels are at ₹990 and ₹807. A close below the latter will even change the long-term outlook to negative. In the quarter ended September 2024, NTPC’s consolidated revenue from operations and EBITDA dipped around 8 per cent each year on year to ₹44,696.3 crore and ₹11,655.2 crore respectively.

As did the IT stocks and Nifty IT Index after peaking in a frenzy in early 2022. However, in the last one year, they have attempted a strong recovery piggy-backing on the AI theme, and Nifty IT is now 6.5 per cent above the 2022 peak. It is not clear though if this will sustain. While recent Q2 results indicate the slowdown may have bottomed out, the pace of revenue growth still remains underwhelming.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country’s second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is Thermax. The stock has surged about 5 per cent on Friday breaking above key resistance on Friday. The price action indicates that a fresh leg of upmove has begun. The outlook is bullish and the share price can go up in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today’s Pick to learn more. Last week we said that #Nifty can bounce back from its support around 24,400. But that view has gone wrong. The fall last week confirms a head and shoulder pattern on the chart. That leaves the danger of seeing more fall in the short-term. A short-lived recovery is also possible before another leg of fall happens. However, from a big picture there are good chances that we could be in the last leg of this correction. So, we expect the broader uptrend to resume after one more leg of fall from here. #Nifty can fall to 23,500-23,000 on a break below 23,900. After this fall, the overall uptrend can resume. #NiftyBank index can fall to 49,700-49,400 and then rise back to 51,000-52,000 again.

Title: With 52% ownership, JB Hi-Fi Limited (ASX:JBH) boasts of strong institutional backing
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/52-ownership-jb-hi-fi-223301738.html
Time Published: 2024-10-27T22:33:01Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Institutions' substantial holdings in JB Hi-Fi implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of JB Hi-Fi Limited (ASX:JBH), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 52% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about JB Hi-Fi. View our latest analysis for JB Hi-Fi Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that JB Hi-Fi does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at JB Hi-Fi's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in JB Hi-Fi. Australian Super Pty Ltd is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. With 6.0% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of JB Hi-Fi Limited. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$30m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 47% stake in JB Hi-Fi. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with JB Hi-Fi . If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The stock’s price increased by more than 7% on October 25th. MicroStrategy’s price action last Thursday continued its 6-week rally and came ahead of its scheduled Q3 earnings report. This week’s stock performance reflected the company’s consistent growth over the past few years. MicroStrategy has outperformed most of its peers in the S&P 500 index and even outpaced Microsoft’s growth since 1999. According to observers, MicroStrategy is bullish, with market analysts listing $245 as the stock’s next target. MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based Bitcoin development company, is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with 252,222 BTC. With Bitcoin’s current price of $67,392, the company holds more than $17 billion in assets. MicroStrategy Stock Hits New Highs MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has soared over 7% to a 25-year high of $236, with a current market cap of $47 billion, overtaking Microsoft in all-time stock gains. Since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset in 2020, MicroStrategy’s stock is up… pic.twitter.com/cyXS0KODCD — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) October 25, 2024 Initially, the company developed software to analyze external and internal data to help decision-making, with IBM Cognos, Oracle Corporation’s BI Platform, and SAP AG Business objects as its primary competitors. However, in August 2020, the company changed its business model to focus on Bitcoin. The company has raised $4.25 billion from its equity offerings, the foundation for growing its Bitcoin holdings. As part of its Bitcoin plan, it aims to buy BTC at every opportunity. For the most part, Saylor’s strategy was a hit. However, the business plan to focus on Bitcoin came at a cost, and Saylor earned a few detractors and critics along the way. For example, the company has expanded its convertible note offering to raise funds to buy more Bitcoin. However, the bulk of these notes do not mature until 2032. Some market observers also say that MicroStrategy is in a difficult situation, especially during market downturns. Since the company relies on Bitcoin, the company’s future is dependent on crypto’s extreme volatility. Although most criticisms are valid, Michael Saylor remains defiant and has since doubled its BTC investments. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 25, 2024 Market observers are now bullish on Saylor’s company. According to Mark Palmer, the company’s stock has boasted a 17.8% yield since starting its Bitcoin strategy. Palmer and the other analysts now target $245 to address this sudden surge and bullish sentiment. Palmer adds that the company’s share price has increased by 1,600% in the last four years, and more gains are possible. It also helps that Michael Saylor has remained steadfast in his vision and passion for Bitcoin. In a recent Twitter/X post, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman hinted at the company’s next move and made a pitch to Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Sam Altman-backed energy stock surges amid AI-driven 'nuclear power renaissance'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Sam Altman-backed nuclear power company Oklo (OKLO) has boomed on the stock market over the past month as investors look to nuclear energy as the next big AI trade. Shares in the company, which is designing so-called small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), have surged nearly 140% over the past month on Big Tech’s growing interest in nuclear power. SMRs are designed to produce cheaper, faster, greener energy than traditional nuclear facilities. Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) in mid-October announced substantial investments in SMR projects as they look to balance their climate goals with the growing energy demands of the data centers powering their various AI software. Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison announced in September that the company intends to build a data center powered by SMRs. “A nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which solves both the increased need for baseload power and the need to decarbonize,” wrote Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine in a recent note to investors. Baseload power refers to the day-to-day energy demand on an electrical grid. Stine said Google and Amazon’s investments are “truly just the beginning of a multi-decade megatrend.” Goldman Sachs estimates that global data center power consumption will grow 160% by 2030, driven by demand from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, separate data from the International Atomic Energy Agency shows nuclear power production in North America potentially doubling by 2050. Stocks of other firms making similar tech to Oklo’s, such as NuScale (SMƒR) and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), also surged following news of Google's and Amazon's investments on Oct. 14 and Oct. 16, respectively, before paring gains this week. “The opportunity is so massive here in the market that there's going to be a good number of folks that are successful,” Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told Yahoo Finance. In fact, the SMR market could grow to $300 billion by 2040, according to research cited by Citi analysts. Oklo went public in May through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, AltC Acquisition Corp., which Altman co-founded. In addition to Altman, Cathie Wood and Peter Thiel are on its list of investors. Sam Altman owned a 2.6% stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing in June. He became chair of Oklo in 2024 after serving as its CEO for three years. While Oklo was founded in 2013, well ahead of the AI boom, the energy needs of artificial intelligence have been a boon to the firm as it builds its client book, DeWitte said. “AI does make [up] the bulk of our order book that we've talked about,” DeWitte said in an interview. That includes clients in the chip sector as well as data centers, he added. Publicly, the company has said it's working with hyperscalers Equinix and Prometheus Hyperscale. It has yet to disclose any deals with Big Tech firms. But Wall Street analysts caution that the company and its competitors face regulatory and supply chain hurdles before they can produce anywhere near the amount of power needed to run artificial intelligence data centers. Nuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. On average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, compared to an average of 54 months in the UK, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity. While a number of companies are developing SMRs — including Bill Gates’ TerraPower — none have been deployed in the US to date, and long licensing processes mean profitability isn't exactly on the horizon. In Oklo’s first earnings report since going public on Aug. 13, the company reported a net loss of about $53 million for the first six months of the year, wider than the roughly $9 million loss it posted in the year-earlier period. Fuel is also an issue for companies in the space: Many SMRs, such as those of Oklo, NuScale, and TerraPower, require a specific type called high-assay low-enriched uranium, also known as HALEU, which is imported from Russia. There's little to no domestic supply since the West at large has avoided developing a HALEU supply chain. That's because enriched uranium is used in nuclear weapons, according to Canaccord Genuity. “A developed Western HALEU supply chain is absent, particularly given efforts to limit enrichment due to concerns over proliferation,” wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in a note to investors early this year. Citing supply constraints and long and difficult licensing processes, Citi’s Vikram Bagri recently reduced his price target on Oklo stock from $11 to $10. “There are too many ‘ifs’ in this process,” Bagri said. “The new technology and new nuclear installs, it seems like, will happen only after 2030. After 2030, it remains to be seen who gets successful and how successful they get, how many nuclear reactors we see.” But Seaport analyst Jeffrey Campbell sees Oklo having advantages in the burgeoning market, pointing to its ability to use “much cheaper” recycled fuel. Whereas a traditional nuclear plant can take billions of dollars to build, Oklo has said the cost of bringing one of its SMRs online is a few hundred million dollars. For his part, DeWitte is optimistic about the future of the market — and Oklo’s place in it. DeWitte cited mounting bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles and enhance the domestic supply of HALEU. He said Oklo is unique because the company is looking to own and operate its facilities and sell energy directly to customers, rather than the traditional model of licensing its technology to utilities. DeWitte believes this will enable the company to bring its reactors online faster. “In the world today, where this opportunity is so massive — diverse customers that need different things, want different things … you're going to see a diverse ecosystem evolve,” he said. He added, “You're not going to see one winner take all.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: The Ambiguity Of Buying From Temu: How To Stay Safe Ahead Of The Festive Retail Season | HackerNoon

Time Published: 2024-10-27T15:30:58Z
Full Content:
As the festive season approaches, holiday shoppers whose budgets have been stretched to their limits could begin looking around for more affordable alternatives in an attempt to fulfill their holiday wishlist. While there are plenty of more affordable budget-friendly options, one name is standing out in the crowd. After years of explosive growth, Temu has become a go-to place for shoppers looking for the best possible deals on high-tech gadgets, toys, clothing, homeware, and plenty more. However, amidst the questionably low prices and an endless array of products to choose from, customers are beginning to raise concerns about Temu’s credibility, with many previous customers complaining about unfulfilled orders, poor product quality, and seemingly non-existent customer service. Temu has become a double-edged sword for many customers looking to cut down on their holiday spending. The online marketplace offers incredible deals and promotions, however, many customers are noticing red flags, with some concerns regarding digital privacy, leaving many shoppers to wonder whether it’s still safe to shop on Temu ahead of the festive season. Many avid online shoppers may have already come across Temu in the past, as the company has pushed some fairly aggressive marketing campaigns in recent years following its launch in the United States about two years ago. Despite the countless internet sleuths claiming that Temu is a fake website, the reality of this couldn’t be farther from the truth. Temu is a very real, and very active online marketplace, which is a subsidiary of the Chinese-based commerce group, PDD Holdings, otherwise known as Pinduoduo Inc. Launched in September 2022 by PDD Holdings, Temu has very quickly become a go-to destination for affordable online shopping. Similar to Amazon, Temu offers an endless selection of products and has partnered with hundreds of brands to help bolster their online inventory lists. Following lofty marketing campaigns, and spending millions of dollars on advertising during the 2022 Super Bowl Championship, Temu has seen surging popularity among millions of consumers, with the e-commerce platform seeing a record-setting 60 million downloads in July 2024 globally, making it more popular than the Amazon marketplace app. The wide selection of cheap deals has helped Temu win over a large portion of the market, especially during a period when the majority of consumers were having to cope with rising prices on the back of decades-high inflation. Temu’s strategic business model allows them to partner directly with manufacturers and warehouses in China while selling directly to customers. By cutting out the middlemen across the supply chain, Temu can sell products at steep discounts, and still offer customers free or partially free shipping, depending on their order or location. Many shoppers may be wondering whether it’s safe to shop on Temu, and while there are plenty of people who have ordered and purchased products from their website, the answer is not necessarily a straightforward one. Before you begin browsing, here are a few things that you should know about shopping in Temu: One of the most important things to take into consideration is that Temu is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB). According to the Better Business Bureau, the online marketplace is currently registered in Massachusetts as a Foreign Corporation through Delaware, although there are several discrepancies for the company not fulfilling the accreditation requirements. For one, the BBB has received thousands of customer complaints during the last several years, which can affect a company’s accreditation. In addition, the BBB does outline that transparent business practices and the number of years a business has been in operation are taken into account when scoring any new business. BBB accreditation helps businesses establish credibility and reliability with customers and state or federal regulators. Not having this status doesn't mean that a company should be barred from operating, instead, consumers are advised to practice increased caution when engaging with non-accredited enterprises. Temu, and more importantly its subsidiary, PDD Holdings have been at the center of multiple allegations that both companies have direct links to the Chinese government, including the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The platform’s involvement in data collection has been linked to People’s Data, an intelligence agency working with the CCP and Chinese authorities. There have been reports that People’s Data helps to manipulate state-run media and data, which harvests data from online sources. Although it’s unclear whether Temu and PDD Holdings are directly involved in the efforts of People’s Data, there are many that have raised concerns about the connections these companies have with Chinese authorities, including the CCP’s propaganda efforts. Legislators have had difficulty closing the current loopholes that exist with U.S. customs regulations, which allow for the import of goods valued below $800 to enter the United States without having to pay customs duty fees or endure multiple rounds of inspections. Temu has managed to use this loophole as a way to sidestep regulatory compliance, which allows them to import countless goods into the country, avoiding any customs duties and minimal scrutiny. According to the Center For Strategic And International Studies (CSIC), Temu has used this loophole in the system to avoid paying import duties, but more than this, created a highly competitive ecosystem that makes it possible for other enterprises to compete at the same level. There are also concerns regarding the importation of counterfeit or illicit goods entering the U.S. market, and the lack of scrutiny that Temu has enjoyed over the last several years. Temu, along with fast-fashion retailer, Shein has provided limited transparency regarding their compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHA) to investigate and minimize the entry of goods that have been manufactured using Uyghur slave labor. Both the UFLPA and DHA help provide more transparency for consumers and in turn bars any manufacturers, exporters, and organizations that are not compliant to conduct business on the U.S. market. However, in more recent months, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has called upon DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to take further action against Temu and Shein for their lack of transparency regarding compliance with UFLPA requirements, and the high probability of these companies exploiting loopholes to facilitate the importation of products that have been manufactured with Uyghur forced labor. Something that has been a recurring issue with many Temu customers is the inconsistent quality of some of their products. As with any major online marketplace, Temu relies on third-party suppliers and allows various vendors to sell through their platform. However, in the past, customers have complained about the quality of their orders, which often leaves a lot of speculation around Temu’s business model and practices. Additionally, there are countless incidents of customers receiving an order that’s nothing like what was advertised, or having received goods that are in a bad condition. It’s worth mentioning that Temu offers a generous 90-day return policy, which is nearly double that of Amazon’s 30-day return policy. However, this safety net does not make up for the gamble that many customers often take when ordering from Temu. Product quality can be inconsistent, and although shoppers might stumble across an incredible deal, having to log a return with Temu customer services can sometimes outweigh the cheaper price customers have to pay for items that can be purchased from local sellers. Temu’s ability to partner directly with Chinese manufacturers and ship from local warehouses allows them to undercut prices, and provide customers with more favorable options to choose from. Not only this, but the platform offers free standard shipping, which varies depending on the order, and free express shipping for orders over $129. These factors have made Temu widely popular among countless consumers looking for a more affordable alternative to local options. This, however, has raised some concerns among business owners, with some claiming that Temu’s dominance could directly threaten and outprice small American businesses. A report has found that Temu now dominates nearly 17% of the U.S. market share, and has gone on to challenge even the biggest low-income retailers such as Dollar Tree and Dollar General, both of which operate 28% and 43% of the market share, respectively. Temu’s ability to directly undercut American retailers has already seen some announcing layoffs or store closures to deal with the shifting consumer landscape. Perhaps it’s our shared consumer experience to look for flaws in a business model that’s not quite what we are used to. This is perhaps even more important in an increasingly polarized political environment where foreign policy between the U.S. and China has undergone tremendous scrutiny. To put things bluntly, the catch with Temu is that you get what you pay for. Paying a highly discounted price for clothes, toys or houseware does come with the uncertainty of whether a product will live up to your expectations and survive years of use. However, it’s not fair to shear all the sheep with the same comb, and some products on Temu are genuinely good quality. In fact, the platform indicates when an item is genuine and helps to provide some transparency to customers regarding the quality of each product sold on the website. Delivery periods may also vary depending on the order and the location you are shipping to. On average, standard shipping can take anywhere from 6 to 20 days, while express shipping can take between 4 and 9 days. However, some customers have reported not receiving their orders within the provided shipping time. Others have shared of never receiving their package, although this could also be due to external factors such as weather conditions, product availability, shipping carriers, shipping method, and order processing time. Something else to think about is that some of Temu’s products are often replicas of existing items. For instance, a pair of sunglasses or slides might be selling for a lot cheaper on Temu compared to Amazon, however, these may be replicas of an original product that’s offered elsewhere. Temu has also been accused of selling counterfeit products, including items that are near-exact replicas of products designed and sold by other vendors. In a Times Magazine article, stories of entrepreneurs having to find out their hand-made designs are being copied and sold on Temu, at a much cheaper price have further raised concerns about the level of product authenticity. Following safety protocols while shopping online is an important practice that every person should apply when browsing through a digital marketplace. Regardless of what your opinion of Temu is, taking steps to protect yourself will limit your information from ending up in the wrong hands. As with any other type of online activity, ensure that your browser is secured. The best way to secure your browsing experience is to adjust your device browser settings such as blocking pop-ups or removing any saved passwords from your browser. Depending on which device you are shopping from, try and use “Incognito Mode” to prevent websites from tracking your activity. Part of keeping your browser secure is to install antivirus software which helps minimize the threat of potential malware attacks. Antivirus software helps to keep devices safe by authenticating websites and links. Additionally, this software can help prevent possible threats or any type of malicious activity that may be taking place without you noticing. As a precaution, shop using your browser instead of an app. While using an app may be more convenient, you can limit the amount of personal information that you need to provide. Not only this, but apps save personal information, and until a few years ago, device makers were able to track your activity while using specific mobile applications. Try and opt out of in-app tracking wherever possible, and keep any information that you need to provide to a minimum. A VPN or Virtual Private Network helps to secure your connections by using network encryptions, instead of ordinary public domains. VPNs work similarly to other software protection security software and can be purchased online and automatically installed on your device. For added security and anonymity, try and use a VPN as much as possible, especially when shopping around websites where you need to provide plenty of personal information to complete transactions. You should always check with the platform through which you are shopping that they provide secure payment options. Most e-commerce sites will offer a variety of payment options, however, the best option is to limit any direct exposure to your personal banking details. In this case, try to make use of a gift card or digital wallet such as PayPal, Venmo, or Apple Pay. Do not provide account or card details on websites where there are limited security verifications for transactions, and try and seek alternative payment methods as much as possible. Many of us may have subscription accounts for online services. While this may make the shopping experience more convenient, there are certain drawbacks to keeping around subscriptions that are not being fully utilized. Aside from having to pay for these subscriptions, you are leaving a lot of personal information available on the table, allowing anyone to access your account at any time. Around 2 out of 5 users experience subscription fatigue, with 37 percent saying they’re struggling to manage all their subscription accounts. Having the same or similar password for various accounts is a recipe for disaster. Not only this but not regularly updating your passwords can create even more dangers for individuals who do not practice online safety. Research suggests that at least 3 in 4 people are facing the risk of being hacked due to poor password management. Update your passwords regularly, avoid using easy-to-guess passwords, and don’t make your password the same across multiple accounts. The best way to uncover whether a product on Temu is worth the price and waiting time is to read through customer reviews. When reading the reviews, make sure that you discern from comments that may have been published by fake accounts to help boost product popularity. There are plenty of businesses out there that will use fake reviews to help improve their product authority. Be sure that what you’re reading is the truth and has been published by human customers. Aside from checking customer reviews, you can read more about the seller as well. This will help give you a better idea of what the seller is like, the type of products and services they provide, and whether they have a trusted relationship with their customers. Again, there are plenty of sellers who may be using fake accounts to help boost their reputation, and it’s advised to do your research to help establish their credibility. While shopping online during the holiday season, familiarize yourself with the various shipping and return policies of platforms. In the case of Temu, customers will have 90 days to return items should a product not have lived up to their satisfaction. Shipping is also something to keep in mind, seeing as Temu ships from Chinese-based warehouses. Various factors can influence when an order arrives and the condition in which it arrives at your door. Yes, Temu is a legit online marketplace that sells affordable products, shipped from Chinese manufacturers and warehouses. As with any international business operating in the United States, there are plenty of challenges the company is currently facing, and shoppers are advised to use Temu at their own discretion. Regardless of your opinion, Temu is providing a service that many American shoppers find incredibly valuable, especially during a period where many consumers have been struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. You get what you pay for when shopping on Temu, and depending on what you are looking to buy from the platform, you should always do your homework before the time to ensure that you get the best value for your money, but also to ensure that your personal information remains safe and is not used in a malicious way.

Title: Cowardly Billionaires Are Obeying Trump in Advance

Time Published: 2024-10-27T15:13:32Z
Full Content:
Rule No. 1 of fighting fascism — do not obey in advance — crumbles as major newspapers kill endorsements to appease Trump. Do not obey in advance. Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do. — Yale historian Timothy Snyder, On Tyranny Once upon a time, in a world that feels so very far away, stories of courage by the reporters, editors, and publisher at the Washington Post inspired a generation of young people to believe that journalism was a way — and maybe the best way — to change the world for good. The pivotal scene in 1976’s All the President’s Men — which burnished both the facts and some legend about the Post, star reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and their role in the Watergate scandal that took down Richard Nixon — takes place in the dead of night on the pitch-black lawn of top editor Ben Bradlee. The two journalists, fearful they are being bugged, relay their source Deep Throat’s warning that “people’s lives are in danger, maybe even ours.” In a famous monologue, Bradlee (played by Jason Robards, who won an Oscar) tells Woodward and Bernstein to keep reporting the story, that “nothing’s riding on this except the First Amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country,” adding his trademarked newsroom cynicism, “not that any of that matters.” Yet, perhaps an even more revealing scene occurs earlier when Nixon’s campaign manager, John Mitchell — called by the reporters for his comment on a damning article — instead issues a warning to the Post’s trailblazing publisher, saying, “Katie Graham’s going to get her [crude word for breast] caught in a big fat wringer if that’s published.” Katharine Graham’s Post had a lot at stake — federal regulators could strip her company’s lucrative TV licenses — yet both the story and the quote, minus the T-word, were published, and the Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its relentless pursuit of Watergate. These are the stories journalists tell ourselves in order to live — so much so that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos felt compelled when he bought the Post from Graham’s heirs in 2013 to invoke them to reassure a wary newsroom that he would never diminish the Post’s reputation for courageous journalism. The $200 billion man wrote in a letter to staffers: “While I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer, if they do, thanks to Mrs. Graham’s example, I’ll be ready.” Bezos was lying. On Friday, the world’s third-richest person, his scandal-scarred British publisher Will Lewis, and the iconic newspaper they control stunned both the American body politic and the media world by spiking their editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president. The move came just days ahead of an election defined by her rival Donald Trump’s increasing threats to impose a tyrannical form of government with mass deportation camps and arrests for his growing enemies list, including journalists. Lewis’ utterly incoherent defense of the decision — ending a tradition of presidential endorsements the Post launched in 1976, the same year All the President’s Men was released — did nothing to quell the rampant, informed speculation that his boss Bezos has killed the already drafted editorial out of fear a revenge-minded Trump 47 could terminate the billionaire’s extensive business dealings with the federal government. It seemed all too fitting that Trump was in Austin, Texas, meeting executives of Bezos’ space venture, Blue Origin, at the same time as the endorsement kibosh. If this looks like the latest saga of open corruption in a nation that’s become a billionaire kleptocracy, it is — but this moment is also so much more than that. America is witnessing the raw power of dictatorship some nine days before voters even decide if that will truly be our future path. The cowardly Bezos can spend billions to erect a man-made projectile that sends him into space, but he’ll never have the cojones of a Katharine Graham. He is obeying fascism in advance, and he is not alone. Three thousand miles west, Bezos’ fellow billionaire, Patrick Soon-Shiong — owner of the Los Angeles Times since 2018 — pulled essentially the same maneuver in killing his editorial board’s endorsement of Harris that had been in the works for weeks, and which followed months of editorials warning of the authoritarian dangers of a Trump presidency. Observers noted that Soon-Shiong is a longtime close friend to — you guessed it — another billionaire, Elon Musk, who is the world’s richest man and has thrown all his time and considerable dollars into getting Trump elected. (Soon-Shiong’s daughter insists the reason was both candidates’ failure to address the carnage in Gaza.) While the moral center of the journalistic universe seemed to be collapsing, Trump told a rally in Tempe, Ariz., that the media is “the enemy of the people, they are. I’ve been asked not to say it, I don’t want to say it. They’re the enemy of the people.” The Republican’s replay of this ominous language echoing dictators of the 1930s was quickly followed by a new threat to create licensing woes for CBS because Trump didn’t like its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Harris, and a lengthy post on Truth Social threatening to prosecute his enemies. » READ MORE: Journalism fails miserably at explaining what is really happening to America | Will Bunch The message here is clear. The cowardice of the news organizations controlled by Bezos and Soon-Shiong has already taught Trump — in the words of Yale’s Snyder, a leading U.S. expert on fascism — what power can do, and if he prevails in next week’s election, he plans to bring that hammer down in full force. What happened at the Post and the Times was a stunning betrayal of journalism’s moral values, but in a strange way, the papers did perform a public service: showing American voters what life under a dictator would feel like. The endorsement cancellations came with a heaping side order of nuance. One irony, as some observers pointed out, is that the expected endorsements of Harris from both editorial boards would have been a tiny blip on the political radar, compared to the earthquake of the owners’ interference. What’s more, there’s an intellectual argument — I once made it myself in a long-vanished blog post — that newspapers shouldn’t endorse candidates. If the Post or the Times had announced such a decision a year ago — and not under the heat of the election’s final days, under pressure from self-interested billionaires — there’d be little controversy. But these reversals, coming now and coming from the poisoned heart of American oligarchy, have instead confirmed the worst fears among an anxiety-wracked electorate that the core institutions that once saved U.S. democracy under the life-and-death pressures of Watergate — the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and an aggressive media — have morally imploded into empty shells. Even worse, readers’ sudden sense of betrayal seems to have greatly accelerated the already steep decline of public trust in American journalism, with reports that both the Post and the Times have been bombarded with thousands of canceled subscriptions. Some have switched to news organizations like The Inquirer, which published a long and compelling endorsement of Harris at almost the exact moment the Post’s capitulation went public. But many readers will be lost for good. This will create even more layoffs, which will lead to even less accountability journalism in a crumbling democracy, which will create even more cynicism — the tainted gasoline that fuels autocracy. It’s also critical to note that this fish stinks mainly from the head. The vast majority of working journalists — most of whom weren’t born yet when Woodward and Bernstein stood on Bradlee’s lawn — are just as outraged as their readers frantically hitting the “cancel my subscription” button. Scores of reporters, columnists, and others in the two newsrooms have bravely condemned their bosses’ decisions in online posts and in open letters. The editorial page editor of the Times, Mariel Garza, resigned in protest — despite the horrendous journalism job market— and at least two other colleagues have joined her. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,” Garza told Columbia Journalism Review. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.” With the election little more than a week away, I hope that the brave actions of Garza and the words of those who are speaking out — a growing list that includes Woodward and Bernstein themselves — will be the ultimate takeaway and not the craven corruption of a little man like Bezos. This early sneak preview of what dictatorship actually looks like is also providing the most important lesson we could have right now, which is how to not obey in advance, but stand up against strongmen and bullies. How all of us respond over the coming days and weeks will decide the fate of the First Amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. And if any of that matters. » READ MORE: SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter Editor’s note: An earlier version of this column gave an incorrect name for Jeff Bezos’ space venture, Blue Origin.

Title: One chart shows how AI will drive another decade of US stock market dominance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence. In JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red). JPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries. Issar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors. As AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins. "It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there," Issar said. To put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sløk wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) To be sure, Sløk noted that this could be a risk to the market overall. "Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia," Sløk wrote. "Let’s hope the value of Nvidia doesn’t decline significantly." Others have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's "global adoption." Colas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are "almost zero." "The US continues to dominate global venture capital," Colas wrote. "If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Magnificent 7 shake-up: Why Wall Street is reassessing Tesla's position and looking toward Netflix

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites. Despite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging — resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade — Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven. The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet. The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines. That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals. “Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.

The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet. The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines. That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals. “Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The earnings avalanche has commenced. And what does that mean? You've probably missed a lot of other stories that could impact your portfolio. After all, there's more to one's investing life than modeling out 2050 profits for Nvidia (NVDA) and wondering whether Tesla (TSLA) will haul in $10 billion in sales from humanoid robots. In the spirit of this, here are a couple of convos I had this week that may leave you thinking (hopefully). AI meets extra spicy hot sauce: I was at a CEO dinner this week where an analyst specializing in AI proceeded to share the deep impact to businesses as AI proliferates. I tend to agree the way business is done will change profoundly, and it'll include a good bit of job loss. An example of AI's impact is in Cholula hot sauce. Its parent, spice maker McCormick (MKC), held an investor day this week. "We have used generative AI to really understand where all the commentary was going [for hot sauce], we learned there were some Cholula lovers out there that wanted a hotter version. So in January, we are launching an extra-hot version of Cholula," McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination Overtime. McCormick reiterated its long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% and earnings growth of 9% to 11%. Shares are up 16% year to date compared to the 22% gain for the S&P 500. You can catch that full spicy segment here. Building a 21st-century media company: The traditional media industry continues to be disrupted by everything from new streaming networks to creators posting on YouTube. Why else do you think Disney (DIS) said this week its CEO Bob Iger was sticking around until 2026 (he was rumored to be leaving in 2025)? He has to leave the business in a much better place than his last exit. One of these disrupters in the past 15 years has been Dude Perfect. The company was started by five friends who went to Texas A&M and rose to fame for viral trick-shot videos posted on YouTube. The company now boasts 60.5 million subscribers and churns out a steady, broader array of content. Armed with a new $100 million capital infusion from Highmount Capital, Dude Perfect is gearing up for more unique programming and the build-out of a headquarters in Frisco, Texas. In charge of bringing that vision to life? Dude Perfect's first-ever CEO Andrew Yaffe, who took the job several weeks ago. "I think people underestimate how big YouTube is," Yaffe told me of the Google-owned (GOOG) platform on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here). "YouTube is the biggest media platform in the US in terms of consumption. Bigger than Netflix (NFLX). And that's growing quickly. It's also the biggest outside the US. It's massive — it is how people under the age of 34 consume content." Not massive: Google's stock price year to date. Shares have lagged the S&P 500's 23% gain, rising only 16%. Big Blue is a big AI player: So much gets lost on a company's earnings day as traders zoom in on the numbers and a couple of trends on the earnings call. Ultimately this is why I think companies should be reporting twice a year, but that's a discussion for a different day. One number that got lost in IBM's earnings release Wednesday (which led to a shellacking in the stock price as consulting sales missed estimates): $3 billion of AI-related project backing. IBM's veteran CFO Jim Kavanaugh tells me the company is tracking toward adding $1 billion in AI project backlog a quarter. That's huge and aligns with what Kavanaugh thinks is a long runway for AI infrastructure buildout. "In my personal opinion, I think it's going to be the longest [adoption] curve that we'll see also because it'll play in many different industries and many different clients," Kavanaugh said. That bullish sentiment was echoed in a convo I had on Opening Bid with BofA analyst Vivek Arya this week, where he went into how AI's buildout will require the use of nuclear power. More insight on that and how it will benefit market darling Nvidia here. Our Morning Brief anchor Seana Smith will be diving into IBM's AI future with chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna at our annual Invest conference on Nov. 12. Want to stop by and say hi and be in the room for some wealth-building chats? Register here! There is still a Marriott running Marriott: Meet David S. Marriott, 50, who assumed the chairman role at Marriott (MAR) from his legendary father J.W. "Bill" Marriott, Jr., 92, in 2022. David's father — who is chairman emeritus — served as chairman for 60 years and CEO for 40 years. Mind-blowing! Bill's parents, Alice Marriott and J. Willard Marriott, founded the company as an A&W root beer stand in 1927. Suffice it to say, the younger Marriott hardly does interviews (he travels a lot and has four children) — so it was a treat to spend time with him on Opening Bid. "I spent several summers doing internships in the kitchen, learning how to prep food, hot food, cold food, and learning how to cook on the line. And, I spent a summer as a bellman and spent some time making beds and working behind the front desk," Marriott told me of his on-the-job training.

Title: Will Magnificent 7 Earnings Be A Trick Or A Treat?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/27/will-magnificent-7-earnings-be-a-trick-or-a-treat/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
The third-quarter earnings season enters its busiest reporting week, including five of the ... [+] Magnificent 7 providing earnings results. Within the S&P 500, 111 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The third-quarter earnings season enters its busiest reporting week, with 170 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), feature heavily in the upcoming earnings week. Five of the seven companies report earnings this week: Alphabet on Tuesday, Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday, and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings last week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the quarterly results will be crucial to stock performance this week. Magnificent 7: Q3 Estimated Earnings Growth Other scheduled companies include McDonald’s (MCD), Visa (V), Starbucks (SBUX), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Uber Technologies (UBER), Chevron (CVX), ExxonMobil (XOM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). The S&P 500 fell by 1% for the week. The Magnificent 7 gained 3.5%, primarily due to a 22% gain in Tesla, which had excellent earnings and a positive profit outlook. Stock Performance After a long trend in the opposite direction due to the better-than-expected monthly jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically exposed defensives. Cyclicals Versus Defensives According to FactSet, the financials and consumer discretionary sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF), KKR & Co (KKR), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Raymond James Financial (RJF) were significant positive contributors. The increase in profits for industrials came primarily from General Motors (GM) and Tesla (TSLA). Relative to expectations at the end of the quarter, the energy, healthcare, and industrials sectors have been the most significant detractors of S&P 500 earnings growth. Earnings estimates for energy companies, including Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), were cut, sending the energy sector estimates to -27.3% year-over-year after expecting a -19.1% at the start of the earnings season. Boeing (BA) reported worse than the previously announced preliminary results, sending the industrials sector estimates to -11.0% year-over-year versus 1.3% growth at the start of the earnings season. Healthcare sector earnings, expected to be a bright spot this quarter, have fallen to an expected 5.8% growth rate compared to 11.2% year-over-year at the end of the quarter. The primary culprit was Eli Lilly (LLY), which saw earnings estimates revised lower after an announcement that acquisition-related charges for in-process research and development (IPR&D) would lower profits by approximately $2.83 billion or $3.08 per share. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from solid year-over-year nominal GDP. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +3.6% year-over-year, below the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.4%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Beyond earnings, this Friday marks the release of the October monthly jobs report. Last month's blowout September jobs report marked a positive change in sentiment about how quickly the economy might be slowing and removed much of the fear about any impending economic recession. The Atlanta Fed’s current estimate of third-quarter GDP growth is a robust 3.3%. While the better-than-expected growth has supported earnings estimates and thus stock prices, bond yields have risen sharply off the recent lows. Treasury Yields The additional rate cuts expected in 2024 are two successive 25 basis point (0.25%) cuts in November and December. While the probability, based on the pricing of Fed Fund futures, remains high, they fell from higher conviction levels as recent economic data has been robust. A weaker- or stronger-than-expected monthly jobs report this week could significantly impact the rate cut expectations. Expected Fed Rate Cuts The busiest week of earnings season has five Magnificent 7 companies reporting earnings. Given the superior expected earnings growth rates and the market capitalization, the Magnificent 7’s quarterly results and outlooks will be crucial for this earnings season and stock performance this week. The earnings outlook from management remains critical, with expectations high and the S&P 500 selling for a not inexpensive 23 times the forward twelve months earnings estimates. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Visa (V), Starbucks (SBUX), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: 3 Big Differences – Nvidia Is Poised To Take Over From Apple

Microchip and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this multiple exposure ... [+] illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 10, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nvidia finally poked its head briefly above the stock value of the dominant Apple empire this week, before settling back down to market value of $3.47 trillion with Apple’s value at $3.52 trillion. Reuters reporting shows how close this is, with a chart showing Nvidia’s rise against Apple and Microsoft, the other two dominant tech companies. “The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other heavyweights, to dominate the emerging technology,” write Reuters reporters Sruthi Shankar and Noel Randewich. “Known since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion.” Microsoft now rests slightly below the other two, with around $3.18 trillion in value. A look back shows that Nvidia also won out temporarily over the same competitors back in June of this year; prior to that, the firm’s stock price was under $100 per share, until it finally spiked early this year and continued to rise. Sticking at around $140 per share, this giant is now poised to earn its crown as the most valuable company in the world. What this represents for the market is a major change from one kind of technology to another. You could express this three different ways: You could say that Apple makes consumer-facing technology, while Nvidia makes ‘back end’ server/hardware technology. You could say that Apple makes endpoint technology, where Nvidia makes supply technology. Or you could say that Apple makes devices that you can use, where Nvidia makes hardware that allows AI to think. With items likes A100 GPU, Nvidia is a dominant producer of AI hardware. And everybody wants a piece of this, from Microsoft and Blackrock, to all kinds of other stakeholders who are getting in on the AI revolution. While Nvidia’s own chips are powerhouses in their own right, analysts show that many companies are investing in their own hardware in the form of custom chips known in the industry as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. Some of those closest to the phenomenon cite companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and others as competitor companies that may rise as their clients look for ASIC technology. However, Nvidia is also making its own play in the ASIC market, and will apparently open sores this technology. “There has been speculation that fixed function application-specific circuits (ASICs) might one day eclipse NVIDIA’s GPU-centric approach,” writes Karl Fruend at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Now NVIDIA itself seems to have embraced this approach, albeit in a limited fashion, announcing its own ASIC technology for Deep Learning acceleration. In a surprising and bold move, the company also announced that it will open source this technology to enable others to build chips using this technology.” Maybe that pivot will help them address one of the major threats to their dominance in the market. In any case, it’s a timely piece of news, because what it shows is that AI is ascendant. We’re watching this technology blossom right before our eyes, in real time, and after a few years of relative obscurity, Nvidia seems to have won out – at least for now. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Tesla Cybertruck Becomes The Third Best-Selling EV In The US

Time Published: 2024-10-26T20:29:28Z
Full Content:
Tesla’s Cybertruck continues to make headlines, as it becomes the third best-selling EV in the US beating all other non-Tesla models. Only the Model 3 and Model Y sold more units. This achievement is even more impressive considering how the Cybertruck was selling at it’s highest price point with the most expensive trim. It’s clear that major automakers like Ford and GM are struggling to compete in the EV market. Tech Crunch reports that Ford only sold around 7,000 F-150 Lightnings and 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs last quarter, while GM sold a total of 32,000 electric vehicles. Rivian’s electric pickup sales were even lower, at around 3,800 units. Tesla’s financial results for the third quarter were impressive, with the company generating $25.2 billion in sales and notching a $2.2 billion profit. The Cybertruck’s positive gross margin and the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers certainly helped boost profits. Additionally, Tesla’s cost-cutting measures have reduced the cost of goods sold per vehicle to $35,100. Investors are taking notice, as Tesla’s stock price jumped over 9% in after-hours trading. However, not all aspects of the business are thriving. Tesla’s Supercharger growth has slowed to 20% year-over-year, likely due to the company-wide layoff earlier this year. Despite this, Tesla remains a dominant force in the EV market.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) is suing cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Inc. (CRWD) over a faulty software update in July that brought its operations to a halt and affected more than a million customers. In a lawsuit Friday, Delta said the software update that affected Microsoft (MSFT) Windows-based systems across the world was "catastrophic" for the company, leading to days of canceled or delayed flights. The airlines estimates that the debacle cost it $500 million, along with loss of future revenue and damaged reputation. The complaint alleges breach of contract, gross negligence and intentional misrepresentation or fraud by omission on CrowdStrike's part. Delta, which was among the most severely affected by the outage, took this legal action after months of finger-pointing among the three companies. Previously, both CrowdStrike and Microsoft had criticized Delta's handling of the situation, saying that the airline refused offers for help. “While we aimed to reach a business resolution that puts customers first, Delta has chosen a different path,” a CrowdStrike spokesperson told CNBC. “Delta’s claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.” CORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct spelling of CrowdStrike in several instances, and of Delta Air Lines.

The era of double-digit growth in the stock market may be coming to an end. Goldman Sachs (GS) strategists led by David Kostin estimate that the S&P 500 index will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns in the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%.

On Wednesday, Bitcoin saw a significant drop of over 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its price hovering around $65,000. This decline has dashed hopes of breaking the $70,000 threshold, which had gained traction just a week prior. The downward trajectory underscores the growing volatility in the crypto market and highlights the interconnectedness between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Tesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company’s quarterly results with a flurry of buying. A 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its “Magnificent Seven” counterparts — and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began. That means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there’s one chart that encompasses 2024’s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out. For example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic — significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week’s gains. Zooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla’s membership in this informal — but important — cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year. Perhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark — who’s above it and who’s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors. Nvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies — 30% of the index — that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market’s broadening and rotation. Since the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek’s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven. “If one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,” Colas wrote. “Our own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.” Ethan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

Title: Will Microsoft Shareholders Vote ‘Yes’ On Bitcoin? What To Expect

In a recent SEC filing dated Thursday, October 24, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) revealed that an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin” will be a voting item at its forthcoming shareholder meeting on December 10. This development has ignited discussions within the investment community about the potential direction of Microsoft’s treasury strategy and the likelihood of shareholder approval. Microsoft’s board of directors has formally recommended voting against the Bitcoin investment proposal. In supplementary materials filed with the SEC on October 25, the board articulated that the requested assessment is redundant, emphasizing that Microsoft’s management already integrates considerations of cryptocurrencies into their broader investment strategy. The board highlights that “This proposal requests that the Board conduct an assessment that is unnecessary because Microsoft’s management already carefully considers this topic. Microsoft’s Global Treasury and Investment Services team evaluates a wide range of investable assets to fund Microsoft’s ongoing operations, including assets expected to provide diversification and inflation protection.” The filing further noted that past evaluations have included Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making,” the filing adds. The board asserted confidence in Microsoft’s existing processes to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders, deeming the public assessment unnecessary. “Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted.” Microsoft’s shareholder base is a diverse mix of institutional investors, public companies, and individual investors. As of June 30, 2024, institutional investors held approximately 43.13% of Microsoft’s outstanding shares, while public companies and individual investors accounted for 56.84%. Insiders held a negligible 0.04% of the shares. The Vanguard Group stands as Microsoft’s largest shareholder, owning around 9.09% of the total shares outstanding. BlackRock follows with a 7.45% stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. State Street holds the third-largest position with a 4.04% ownership. Given this distribution, these major shareholders could be pivotal in determining the outcome of the proposal. Vanguard’s anti-BTC stance suggests a likely “no” vote, aligning with the board’s recommendation. Conversely, BlackRock has become a strong proponent of Bitcoin and offers its US clients a spot Bitcoin ETF since January this year. In their latest earning call, CEO Larry Fink said, “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” He added, “It is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” State Street seems somewhat open-minded to Bitcoin. In mid-September, State Street launched in collaboration Galaxy 3 new crypto ETFs. In August, State Street partnered with Taurus to enhance its crypto services, facilitating the transformation of real-world assets into tradable digital assets. Nonetheless, industry analysts largely predict that the proposal to invest in Bitcoin will not gain sufficient support among Microsoft shareholders. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, summarized the situation on X: “Microsoft Shareholders to Vote on Proposal to Invest in Bitcoin. MSFT Board Advises ‘Nay’. No-Coiner Vanguard owns ~9%.” Similarly, Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and Co-Founder of the ETF Institute, expressed his expectations: “Gonna go out on a limb & predict Microsoft’s largest shareholder (Vanguard) will be voting ‘no’ on adding btc to the balance sheet…” Di Lewis, CFO at BTC Inc., also expressed strong skepticism about Microsoft’s likelihood to adopt Bitcoin, stating there is “0% chance Microsoft adds bitcoin to their balance sheet this decade.” Adam Cochran, a partner at CEHV, dismissed the proposal as a “fringe” idea from a think tank shareholder. He stated, “No. This is a fringe proposal by a think tank shareholder, and is not a serious consideration by Microsoft at large.” At press time, BTC traded at $67,608.
