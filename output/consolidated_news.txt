Title: Thames Water debt pile rises further despite return to profit

The UK's largest supplier reveals a surge in complaints about rising bills but says its performance, such as in preventing sewage spills, has improved. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 December 2025 07:33, UK Cash-strapped Thames Water has revealed a further rise in its debt pile while recording a return to profit on the back of inflation-busting hikes to bills. The UK's largest supplier said the 31% rise to customer bills since April had allowed it to increase capital investment by 22% to £1.3bn amid demands it improve performance in preventing sewage spills and stopping leaks. Thames Water said it recorded a 20% drop in pollution incidents over the six months to the end of September, and leakage performance was holding steady despite the "extremely dry summer". Money latest: How much is a fair restaurant tip? While waste complaints dipped by 11%, according to the company, there was a 42% surge in the number of customers complaining about the hike to bills. Thames Water revenue rose 42% on the same period last year to £1.9bn, helping a return to profit after tax of £328m on the back of a £190m loss during April-September 2024. Stronger reforms called for over baby formula crisis Hundreds of UK moderators have left TikTok - sparking safety fears, whistleblowers reveal Engineer loses case against her employer over transgender toilet policy The company said profitability was damaged by higher debt serving costs. Its debt pile was recorded at £17.6bn - a rise of 5%. The results were released against the backdrop of continuing talks involving the government and regulators over a proposed rescue deal by major Thames Water creditors. Their consortium is known as London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but regulator Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of industry oversight, has been leading scrutiny of London & Valley's operational plan and proposed capital structure. The prospective deal would write off billions of pounds of the company's debt and inject billions in fresh equity, in return for an adjustment in the regulator's approach to future financial penalties. Thames sees the creditors' proposal as the only viable solution. Despite huge hikes to household bills - allowed across England and Wales to bolster aging infrastructure including storm overflows - the company says its financial turnaround has been hampered by record fines for things like sewage leaks and bonuses to retain key staff. Sky News revealed on Tuesday that its remuneration committee will meet next week to decide whether to proceed with nearly £2.5m in retention payments to 21 senior managers.

"This progress has all been achieved as we also manage the recapitalisation of the business. We continue to work closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led solution that we believe is in the best interests of our customers and the environment. "This in turn will allow the transformation of Thames to continue, a programme that will take at least a decade to complete and will restore the infrastructure and operations of the company."

Title: BlackRock’s top brass says tokenization will bridge crypto and finance

BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management, and operates the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. Former crypto skeptic BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and chief operating officer Rob Goldstein say tokenization will act as a bridge between the crypto industry and traditional finance, doubling down on their support of the sector. In an opinion article penned by Fink and Goldstein and published Monday in The Economist, the pair said that tokenization won’t replace the existing financial system any time soon, but predict it will help merge the two industries. “Think of it instead as a bridge being built from both sides of a river, converging in the middle. On one side stand traditional institutions. On the other are digital-first innovators: stablecoin issuers, fintech’s and public blockchains,” the pair wrote. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Its co-founder and CEO, Fink, was previously a crypto skeptic before he changed his mind. Fink and Goldstein said at first glance, it was hard for them to see the “big idea” because tokenization was tangled up in the crypto boom, which “often looked like speculation.” “But in recent years, traditional finance has seen what was hiding beneath the hype: tokenization can greatly expand the world of investable assets beyond the listed stocks and bonds that dominate markets today,” they added. BlackRock already has the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, launched in March 2024. However, Fink and Goldstein also stated that tokenization must proceed safely, with appropriate regulations, which requires policymakers and regulators to update the rules to enable traditional and tokenized markets to work together. Related: Plume CEO tips RWA to grow 3-5x in 2026 as it grows past crypto natives Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) followed a similar path for fixed income, connecting dealer markets with public exchanges, allowing investors to trade more efficiently, according to Fink and Goldstein. “And now with spot Bitcoin ETFs, even digital assets are on traditional exchanges. Each of these innovations builds bridges. The same principle applies to tokenization,” they said.

Title: Criteo CEO Michael Komasinski on agentic commerce, experiments with LLMs, and M&A rumors

Save 50% on a 3-month Digiday+ membership. Ends Dec 5. In early 2025, Criteo entered a new chapter, with its current CEO, Michael Komasinski, taking the reins as the fourth chief executive of the company in its 20-year history — a sign that investors expect bold strategic recalibration for the Nasdaq-listed outfit. That transition comes amid a turbulent backdrop: over the last several years, its share price and market cap have fluctuated amid speculation over “signal-loss,” albeit Google’s U-turn on its earlier plans for Chrome augured well in Komasinski’s time in office, not to mention the disruptive emergence of AI. In response, Criteo has attempted to rebrand itself from a heavy-hitting retargeting outfit to a commerce media platform that’s now experimenting with LLMs, publishers, and retailers alike to hone monetization in the AI-first era. Komasinski sat down with Digiday to discuss these efforts on the sidelines of a recent press event, explaining his strategy as he approaches his one-year anniversary in office. The conversation below has been edited for brevity and clarity. I think there are two tracks in terms of how it changes things. The first is the self-service… we will launch Commerce Go as a self-service tool by the end of Q1 next year. That means an advertiser can go online, put in their credit card information, and have campaigns up and running in 10 minutes. It is competitive with some of the self-service tools from Meta with Advantage+ or from Google with Performance Max –the differentiation versus those platforms is that it’s cross-channel. Criteo has always had a healthy amount of managed service that was required to drive the platform, and I see that changing quite a bit over the next couple of years. The second track around agentic with retail, that really is an extension of what we do today — the ability to power sponsored ads or improved relevancy for a retailer — that’s just an extension of capabilities that we serve on product detail pages currently. Nothing to disclose on revenue models or forecasts yet, but it is exciting. One of the reasons it is exciting is that it leverages existing infrastructure, so we don’t have to reinvent the way crawling monetization is resolved. It’s using the RTB pipes that the BidSwitch is built on, and for mid-to-longtail publishers, which is a segment that’s like really underserved in the LLM free-for-all that’s going on. So, we’re encouraged by the pilot with RTB, and looking to find other publishing partners to do further testing with, then we’ll start to refine that monetization model, and hopefully that will turn out to be a viable product for mid-to-longtail publishers and us. When you’re a publicly traded company, right, you are always looking for ways to maximize value for shareholders. But no, we’re not in a process of any kind today; the redomiciling of the parent-level entity is really designed to improve our ability to attract passive capital to our shares and to improve trading liquidity. It doesn’t really change the operations of the business. Our tech team is still based in Paris, as are many of our back office functions, and we don’t see any changes to that. So it should help the stock become more easily included in passive indices like ETFs, which should be good for our shareholders. I don’t have anything firm to say on that, other than, again, as a publicly traded company, you always have a responsibility to look at your portfolio of assets and to make sure that everything’s a good fit for the strategy that you’re pursuing. As we continue to make progress with the whole set, commerce media is the north star, and all of the different segments are laddering up to that pretty well, but it is a responsible thing to always be looking at your portfolio. We are excited about it, but I think the reason we don’t talk more about it is that the test isn’t complete yet. There’s testing that’s happening over the course of this month, so we don’t want to get ahead of that, although I’m pretty confident that the test results will be positive. When you’re dealing with a third party that you’re dependent on, it’s not about what you think; it’s about what they want to do, but I think the results show an uplift in relevancy. It’s up to them as to what they want to do with that. Is that something they want to pay for, or is that something that shapes how they think about native ad units powered by intelligence?

Title: Meesho IPO: Samir Arora Calls For Regulator Intervention On Fairness Amid Anchor Allotment Row

India’s red-hot IPO market has been jolted by a rare backlash after several major global investors reportedly pulled out of Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book, prompting Helios Capital founder Samir Arora to call for urgent regulatory intervention to make the process “more fair.” Arora criticised the current structure of anchor allocations in high-demand IPOs, describing them as “a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms.” Regulator must intervene to make this process more fair. Right now allocations in hot IPOs are just a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms. pic.twitter.com/IFjGHDD9H3 His comments followed a Bloomberg report that Meesho allocated nearly a quarter of its anchor tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., India’s largest asset manager a move that triggered pushback from other institutional investors. In a clarification posted later, Arora stressed that his criticism was not directed at SBI MF. “They are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early,” he said. The issue, he insisted, lies with funds that inflate orders at the last minute to secure allocations without truly participating in price discovery. “Then what anchor,” he wrote, arguing that many so-called anchors simply “pile on” because the IPO is hot. My tweet is not against SBI MF for they are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early. My point is against all these funds who inflate their orders at the last moment and do not really "anchor" any deal but pile on. Then what anchor.May be one ideaâ¦ https://t.co/FmCBITtB0W Arora floated a potential solution: anchor lists should be finalised and announced 30 days before an IPO opens, ensuring that institutions engage meaningfully in negotiating and setting valuations instead of swooping in based on the momentum of the deal. The current process, he said, encourages opportunistic bidding driven by commissions and size rather than long-term commitment. According to a report by Bloomberg, Meesho’s anchor book faced withdrawals from several prominent investors after the disproportionate allocation to SBI Funds. Those who pulled out included Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon India Life Asset Management, and Nomura Asset Management. Many of these funds, according to the report, had sought allocations similar to SBI Funds and opted out in protest when their expectations were not met. The anchor tranche is a crucial signalling mechanism for market confidence, typically drawing long-only global investors who help set the tone for pricing. Meesho, however, received strong institutional participation in its pre-IPO anchor round, raising Rs 2,440 crore on Tuesday. Marque foreign entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, Government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Schroder Group, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were allotted shares.

The IPO comprises a fresh issue of shares worth ₹670 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of 2.03 crore shares valued at ₹252 crore by promoters and existing investors, taking the total issue size to ₹922 crore. Funds raised from the fresh issue would be used for repaying loans taken by the company and its two subsidiaries -- AeroStructures Manufacturing India and Aequs Consumer Products; purchasing machinery and equipment for the company and AeroStructures; and supporting future growth through potential acquisitions, other strategic initiatives, and for general corporate needs. Last month, Aequs raised around ₹144 crore from SBI Funds Management, DSP India Fund and Think India Opportunities Fund as a part of a pre-IPO funding round. Aequs initially filed confidential draft papers with Sebi in June and secured approval in September to launch the IPO. By opting for the confidential pre-filing route, the company could delay public disclosure of IPO details until later stages, a strategy increasingly adopted by Indian firms seeking flexibility in their IPO planning. Aequs primarily operates in the aerospace segment, but over the years, it has expanded its product portfolio to include consumer electronics, plastics, and consumer durables. Its consumer products include cookware and small home appliances, while its plastics offerings include outdoor toys, figurines, toy vehicles, and components for consumer electronics such as portable computers and smart devices. The company is backed by prominent investors, including Amicus Capital, Amansa Capital, Steadview Capital, Catamaran -- the family office of Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy --, and Sparta Group. Its key clients are Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Collins Aerospace, Spirit AeroSystems Inc., Safran, GKN Aerospace, Mubea Aerostructures, Honeywell, Eaton, and Sabca in aerospace, and Hasbro, Spinmaster, Wonderchef, and Tramontina in consumer products. It operates manufacturing facilities across India, France, and the USA. In India, the company runs three manufacturing clusters in Belagavi, Hubballi, and Koppal in Karnataka. Founded by Aravind Melligeri, who has decades of experience in the aerospace sector and was a co-founder of Quest Global Engineering. As per the company, 75 per cent of the issue size has been reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15 per cent for non-institutional investors and the remaining 10 per cent for retail investors. The company will make its debut on the stock market on December 10. Published on December 3, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

The Softbank-backed firm Meesho’s IPO remained modest, with the issue subscribed 0.56 times so far on the first day of bidding. Retail investors drove most of the early traction, while institutional participation remained absent in the initial hours. Two other mainboard IPOs, which opened today, Aequs and Vidya Wires were fully subscribed by mid-day. “We believe Aequs Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in a one of India’s most advanced and fully integrated aerospace precision-manufacturing platforms. We think with a unique position as the only Indian manufacturer operating from a single SEZ with end to end aerospace capabilities that is spanning machining, forging, surface treatment and assembly, company offers high entry-barrier exposure to a globally outsourced industry. We also think company’s global manufacturing footprint across India, the U.S. and France enhances customer proximity and collaboration, enabling it to win and retain long-term contracts with global OEMs such as Airbus, Boeing, Safran Collins and Spirit AeroSystems, many of whom have relationships exceeding 15 years. By looking at the financials, While the company reported muted financial performance the revenue from operations growth of 18.8% in FY24 followed by a 4.2% decline in FY25, with losses driven largely by a slowdown in the consumer division and strategic business transitions. While the core aerospace segment continues to demonstrate strong and structural momentum. On valuation parse at the upper price band of Rs. 124/-, the issue is asking for a Market cap of Rs. 8316/- cr. Based on FY2026 annualised earning company is asking for price to book value of 5.7x which seems reasonable compare to its listed peer trading at an average of ~10x. Given the strong customer stickiness, a diversified portfolio and JVs with global leaders like Magellan Aerospace, Aubert & Duval and Tramontina, we believe Aequs is well-positioned to capture the rising outsourcing trend in aerospace precision components. Its ability to leverage aerospace capabilities into high-volume consumer products further strengthens utilisation and margins. Hence, considering its strong competitive moat, global customer base, and alignment with the rising aerospace manufacturing opportunity in India, we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the Aequs Ltd IPO for a long-term perspective.” Contrary to manufacturing, services in the private sector showed an improvement in November, a survey by S&P Global, released on Wednesday, showed.

India's Services PMI rose to 59.8 in November, indicating robust demand and modest job creation amid low price pressures. · The Indian rupee fell over the psychologically important 90 per US dollar threshold today, prolonging weakness in trade and capital flows, combined with concerns about a missed trade deal with Washington, keeping the currency under pressure. · Gold and silver continue to rise as recent data indicates a gradual cooling of the US economy, combined with dovish signals from Fed policymakers, has bolstered market expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut at the US central bank’s meeting next week, with traders pricing in an 89% chance of the move. · According to the World Gold Council, central banks purchased 53 tons of gold in October, a 36% monthly increase and the most monthly net demand since the beginning of 2025. · Investors are also monitoring November ADP employment report on Wednesday and the delayed September PCE Index, coming Friday, which is the Fed’s favored inflation barometer.

Meanwhile he provided a hint pointing to Kevin Hassett as the “potential” next Federal Reserve chair during a White House event Meanwhile, Switzerland signalled that it may need to adjust to ongoing US tariffs despite securing parity with the EU in a recent tariff deal. SECO chief Helene Budliger Artieda noted that a return to earlier tariff levels appears unlikely in the near term. On the domestic front The government clarified that it is not considering a proposal to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in public sector banks to 49% from the current 20%. At present, the FDI cap stands at 20% for PSBs and 74% for private banks, with automatic approval permitted up to 49% and the government route required beyond that. Separately, the Cabinet Secretariat has asked state governments to flag any pending issues they face with central government departments in connection with its ongoing deregulation exercise, multiple senior government officials said, ahead of a meeting of chief secretaries later this month to review the reforms. In the commodities segment, India’s palm oil imports inched up 4.6% month-on-month in November to 630,000 metric tons, as refiners capitalised on lower prices and trimmed purchases of costlier soyoil and sunflower oil. Energy flows saw a sharp adjustment as India’s imports of Russian crude declined following stricter US sanctions implemented on November 21. While November arrivals averaged 1.8 million bpd—boosted by pre-sanction stocking—post-deadline shipments dropped to 1.27 million bpd. December imports are projected at around 1.0 million bpd, with a potential temporary dip toward 800,000 bpd before stabilising. On the macro outlook, the OECD maintained its FY26 growth forecast for India at 6.7%, supported by monetary easing and GST reforms, and kept the FY27 projection unchanged at 6.2%. It noted that a successful rollback of US tariffs could lift confidence and boost manufacturing exports, while elevated oil prices remain a key downside risk for inflation and consumption. Meanwhile, under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) scheme, just over one-third of the FY26 allocation—₹56,826 crore—has been released for 4,106 approved projects as of November 27. Uttar Pradesh leads with 482 projects worth ₹8,465 crore, followed by Maharashtra (331) and Odisha (288), with the top 10 states accounting for about 65% of total sanctioned projects.

Stock benchmarks are set to open higher after a three-session drop, despite foreign investor outflows impacting the rupee. Key highlights: Central banks bought a net 53t in October, 36% higher m/m and the largest monthly net demand y-t-d A familiar set of buyers – led by a resurgent National Bank of Poland – drove the gains Total y‑t‑d reported buying through October solidly positive at 254t, but slower than previous years. Financial liabilities more than doubled from ₹7.7 lakh crore to ₹15.7 lakh crore ( nearly 104% increase) between FY20 and FY24. Non-housing retail loans increased by almost 164% since FY20 Personal loans increased by 130% from 2020 to 2025. The short-term outlook is bullish for Birlasoft. The 5 per cent rise on Tuesday indicates that the upmove is gaining momentum. The price action since late September this year indicates a bull channel. Buy Birlasoft shares at ₹404.90; potential rise to ₹445-₹450 with a bullish outlook and strategic stop-loss guidance.

Title: Marvell Rallies After Upbeat CEO Remarks, Celestial AI Deal
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/marvell-rallies-after-upbeat-ceo-remarks-celestial-ai-deal-11764720328584.html

(Bloomberg) -- Marvell Technology Inc. rallied in late trading after reassuring investors that its custom chip-design unit is winning repeat orders, signaling continued growth as the company benefits from runaway spending on AI computing. On a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Marvell said it’s now more bullish about revenue growth next year and predicted that custom chip sales will increase 20%. Large customers have renewed orders, and Marvell said there won’t be a repeat of previous “air pockets,” when sales in that unit have declined. The company also announced plans to acquire startup Celestial AI for at least $3.25 billion, a move it said would bolster the artificial intelligence push. On the call, Chief Executive Officer Matt Murphy indicated that Marvell revenue could reach $10 billion in the next fiscal year, well above the $9.47 billion predicted by analysts. “We’re very optimistic about our outlook over the next couple of years,” he said. The remarks sent the shares up more than 15% in late trading, reversing earlier declines. The stock had been down 16% this year through Tuesday’s close. Marvell has tried to position itself to benefit from the AI spending boom — with mixed success. Though it’s helping cloud-computing companies like Amazon.com Inc. design custom chips to handle AI, those products aren’t as widespread as Nvidia Corp. processors. The latest commentary suggests that Marvell is making some headway. On the call, the company said it expected “accelerated growth” in its custom chip business. Recent customer wins include an “emerging hyperscaler” — an industry term that describes a large data-center operator. Marvell also forecast revenue of roughly $2.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which runs through January, in line with the average Wall Street projection. Adjusted gross margin will be about 59% in the period, the company said, compared with an average prediction of 59.5%. Marvell forecast earnings of 79 cents a share, matching the estimate. In the Celestial AI deal, Marvell is offering $1 billion in cash and stock valued at $2.25 billion, according to a separate statement. Under the agreement, Celestial AI investors stand to be paid as much as $2.25 billion in additional Marvell shares if the business hits certain revenue targets. Celestial AI, a Santa Clara, California-based startup founded in 2020, offers a technology called photonic fabric that connects components within AI infrastructure. It relies on light to more efficiently move data, helping artificial intelligence systems run more quickly. The startup, which completed a $255 million funding round in August, was backed by Fidelity Management & Research Co., BlackRock Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan also was an investor, and he joined the company’s board earlier this year. The takeover is slated to close in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The additional payouts begin to take effect if Celestial AI reaches cumulative revenue of at least $500 million by the end of Marvell’s fiscal 2029. The full amount will be paid if the cumulative revenue tops $2 billion by that point. The Information previously reported that Marvell was in talks to acquire Celestial AI.

More Info The world’s biggest private equity groups are investing in infrastructure assets of the national oil companies of the Middle East as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) opened their pipeline networks to foreign capital. Private equity giants are now seeking a slice of the infrastructure assets of the international majors in deals that would give Big Oil funds to reinvest in oil and gas production. These days, amid lower oil prices and continued reluctance of public-market investors despite the dramatic shift in the ESG narrative, private equity money could be an opportunity for the top Western majors to raise cash by selling parts of their pipeline and storage assets. The infrastructure deals in the oil and gas sector began from the Middle East, but these could spread to the international majors, which need capital to sustain dividends and buybacks at $60 oil and have enough to invest in boosting oil and gas production. Investors Eye Big Oil’s Infrastructure Assets Investors have recently urged top executives from ExxonMobil, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni to consider selling stakes in pipeline and storage assets to private equity groups in what would be a new way for Big Oil to monetize their infrastructure assets and one that doesn’t involve equity-market investors. Ahead of ADIPEC, one of the energy industry’s top gatherings, private equity teams sat down at a closed-door meeting with Exxon, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni and told their executives that they could offload more of their infrastructure assets, the Financial Times reports. “You guys need to rethink how you think about capital,” one participant at the meeting told the majors, the FT says. Right now, private equity giants are more inclined to invest in Big Oil than the equity markets that are “not as receptive” to the oil and gas industry, the participant told FT. Related: U.S. Sanctions Force Serbia's Only Refinery to Shut Down “Take the cheap capital and reinvest it in your core business,” the person added, referring to Big Oil’s opportunities to attract funds from the infrastructure arms of the biggest investment firms. Some deals have been made this year. For example, Apollo-managed funds in March signed a deal with BP to invest about $1 billion to purchase a 25% non-controlling stake in BP Pipelines (TANAP) Ltd, the BP subsidiary that holds BP’s 12% interest in TANAP, owner and operator of the pipeline that carries natural gas from Azerbaijan across Turkey. While the deal enables BP to monetise its interest in TANAP, BP will remain the controlling shareholder of BP TANAP and retain a long-term commercial and strategic interest, including governance rights, in the pipeline - a vital part of the gas value chain for the BP-operated Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan. Prior to that, Apollo and BP signed an agreement for Apollo to buy a non-controlling stake in BP Pipelines TAP Limited, which holds a 20% share in Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG (TAP) in a transaction valued at about $1 billion. “BP and Apollo continue to explore opportunities for further cooperation, including in infrastructure, gas and low carbon energy assets,” the UK-based supermajor said in March 2025, just as it had unveiled its strategic reset to shift focus back to oil and gas. This summer, Shell completed the sale of its 16.125% interest in the company owning the Colonial Pipeline in the U.S. to Colossus AcquireCo LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its institutional partners. Other supermajors have yet to announce major deals in the trend that the Middle East’s national oil companies kicked off. Investors Flock to Middle East Energy Infrastructure As early as in 2020, Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC struck a $20.7-billion deal with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield, among other investors, to sell a 49% stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets LLC. This year, global investment firm KKR bought a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets. KKR was part of the first-ever energy infrastructure deal for a Middle Eastern NOC when it bought in 2019 a minority stake in ADNOC’s oil pipelines business. The 2019 acquisition of 40% in ADNOC Oil Pipelines by KKR and BlackRock was the first-ever investment of foreign asset managers in infrastructure of a state-owned energy firm in the Gulf. Last year, KKR and BlackRock sold the 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines to Abu Dhabi-based alternative investment manager Lunate. Saudi Arabia is also looking for opportunities to monetize Aramco’s infrastructure with deals with global funds. Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is a key part of Aramco’s plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand. Infrastructure deals have flourished in the Middle East in recent months. Last year, Bapco Energies of Bahrain sold to a BlackRock fund a minority ownership stake in the Saudi Bahrain Pipeline Company (SBPC). Kuwait’s state firm Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is looking to raise up to $7 billion from leasing part of its pipeline network in a transaction that would be similar to Aramco’s deal, Bloomberg reported in September. The trend of global infrastructure funds buying into energy infrastructure started in the Middle East but is already expanding to Big Oil, as evidenced in the recent Shell and BP pipeline deals. Private equity money would be a win-win for the participants in transactions—the international majors will get capital outside of their traditional (and drying) public-markets base, while infrastructure funds will get long-term reliable returns on their investment.

Cheyenne, Wyoming-based Kraken said the transaction for the provider of services bridging equities to decentralized finance would "accelerate the global adoption of xStocks"—securities that already trade on markets made available on blockchains. Kraken this year has been working with Backed to offer tokenized stocks and ETFs to its clients using crypto networks like Ethereum and Solana. Tokenization refers to the process of taking real-world assets and representing them on-chain using digital assets. "Integrating Backed into Kraken strengthens the core architecture required for open and programmable capital markets," Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said in a statement. "Unifying issuance, trading and settlement under one framework ensures the infrastructure for tokenized assets remains transparent, reliable and globally accessible. This is foundational work for the next era of market structure." Kraken would not reveal the size of the transaction to Decrypt. The company has made a number of acquisitions this year as it prepares for a public offering. In September, the exchange bought proprietary trading platform Breakout for an undisclosed amount, and earlier this year snapped up futures trading platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. Sethi has previously said that "traditional markets run on post-WWII, 1950s banking systems," and the company was aiming to become an "institutional-grade trading platform where any asset can be traded, anytime." He added on Tuesday that the latest acquisition was "bigger than giving people exposure to U.S. equities, it's about redefining what it means to own assets in the digital era." Traditional finance firms' interest in tokenization has risen in recent years. BlackRock boss Larry Fink has frequently spoken about how it will change capital markets and now has a tokenized money-market fund. And Wall Street giant Franklin Templeton has been tokenizing assets on a number of blockchains for years.

Title: IBIT Among Most-Traded ETFs as Bitcoin Surges; Mining Stocks Sink

Bitcoin BTC$93,163.16 bounced back on Tuesday, gaining about 6% over the last 24 hours after a sharp sell-off to start the week. The rebound helped drive heavy activity in crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which was among the most-traded ETFs in the U.S. for the day. IBIT saw around $3.7 billion in trading volume Tuesday, surpassing the S&P 500 ETF from Vanguard (VOO), which recorded $3.28 billion, according to data from Barchart. That puts BlackRock’s bitcoin fund in rare company, alongside some of the most liquid and widely held ETFs in the market. The spike in volume may be tied to bitcoin’s price recovery, but it also came a day after Vanguard, which had long been resistant to crypto, said it would begin allowing bitcoin ETFs and crypto mutual funds to trade on its brokerage platform. BlackRock’s bitcoin funds have quickly become a cornerstone of the firm’s product lineup, despite launching less than two years ago. IBIT alone now holds $66.3 billion in net assets and has become the firm’s top revenue-generating ETF. That’s notable considering BlackRock manages over 1,400 ETFs and has $13.4 trillion in total assets under management. Cryptos across the board also traded higher on Tuesday, with ether ETH$3,206.03, XRP and DOGE$0.1505 all gaining around 7% over the past 24 hours. Cardano’s native token, ADA, led the race with 14%. Chainlink’s token, LINK, was also 11% higher after Grayscale debuted a new ETF tied to the token on NYSE Arca on Tuesday. The bounce in bitcoin prices Tuesday rippled through crypto-related stocks. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), which holds more than 174,000 BTC on its balance sheet, rose 6%. Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), which offers crypto services alongside stocks, gained 2%. Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, climbed 5%, and Circle (CRLC), the firm behind the USDC stablecoin, added 4%. Coinbase (COIN) moved in the opposite direction. Its shares fell 5% after a group of shareholders filed a lawsuit Monday accusing company executives of engaging in a yearslong scheme to unload billions of dollars in stock while misleading investors. The suit claims insiders took advantage of inflated valuations following Coinbase’s 2021 public listing to cash out at the expense of long-term shareholders. The picture in bitcoin mining stocks looked less rosy. Despite the broader crypto market’s rebound, most miners traded in the red on Tuesday. Shares of Iren (IREN) led the declines with a 15% drop, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), which fell 10%, and TeraWulf (WULF), down 7%.

Title: Trump DOJ Sides With Roundup Manufacturer Over Cancer Victims in Supreme Court Case

Bottles of Roundup weed and grass killer are stacked at a Costco Wholesale store on March 11, 2025, in San Diego, California. An attorney at Food & Water Watch said the DOJ sent a "clear message... to sick Americans harmed by toxic pesticides: Trump has Bayer’s back, not theirs." The Trump administration is pushing for the US Supreme Court to shield the manufacturer of Roundup from thousands of state lawsuits alleging that its widely used herbicide product causes cancer. On Monday, US Solicitor General D. John Sauer recommended that the high court agree to hear a challenge to a Missouri jury's verdict in 2023 that awarded $1.25 million to a man named John Durnell, who claimed that the product caused him to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Bayer, the agribusiness giant that purchased the manufacturer of Roundup, the agribusiness giant Monsanto, in 2018, immediately challenged the verdict. In 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, as "probably carcinogenic to humans" based on "limited evidence." That evidence became less limited in 2019, when a prominent meta-analysis by a team of environmental health researchers found that people exposed to glyphosate at the highest levels had a 41% higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma than those who weren't. There are nearly 4,500 Roundup claims currently pending in federal court, and at least 24 cases have gone to trial since October 2023. They make up just a fraction of the more than 170,000 claims filed. According to Bloomberg, Bayer has already been forced to pay out more than $10 billion in verdicts and settlements over the product, which has caused a massive drain on the company's stock price. In what it said was an effort to “manage litigation risk and not because of any safety concerns,” Bayer removed glyphosate-based herbicides from the residential market in 2023, switching to formulas that “rely on alternative active ingredients.” That didn't stop the lawsuits from coming. Durnell's victory was the first successful case brought against Bayer outside California, the only state that labels the product as carcinogenic. That in Missouri opened the floodgates in other states, and plaintiffs subsequently won sizable payouts in Georgia and Pennsylvania. But now the Trump administration is trying to help the company skirt further accountability. Sauer, who is tasked with arguing for the government in nearly every Supreme Court case, filed a 24-page brief stating that there is a lack of clarity on whether states have the authority to determine whether Bayer and Monsanto violated the law by failing to warn customers about potential cancer risks from Roundup. Bayer argues that these cases are preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which forbids states from enacting labeling requirements more stringent than those recommended by the federal government. Sauer agreed with Bayer, stating in the brief that the US Environmental Protection Agency "has repeatedly determined that glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic in humans, and the agency has repeatedly approved Roundup labels that did not contain cancer warnings." In 2016 and again in 2020, the EPA indeed classified glyphosate as "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans" following agency assessments. However, in 2022, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals voided this assessment, finding that the agency applied “inconsistent reasoning” in its review of the science. Among the justifications for the ruling were that the EPA relied heavily on unpublished, non-peer-reviewed studies submitted to regulators by Monsanto and other companies that manufacture glyphosate. The agency also largely disregarded findings from animal studies included by the IARC, which showed a strong link between glyphosate and cancer. "The World Health Organization has recognized glyphosate as a probable carcinogen while the EPA continues to twist itself into pretzels to come to the opposite conclusion," Lori Ann Burd, a staff attorney and director of the Center for Biological Diversity's environmental health program, told Common Dreams. Notably, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. built his national profile campaigning against the dangers of pesticides and railing against regulatory capture by big business. Kennedy served as an attorney for Dewayne Johnson, the first plaintiff to win damages against Monsanto in 2018, where a jury determined that Roundup had contributed to his cancer. "If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luthor," Kennedy said in a 2020 Facebook post. "I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value." During Kennedy's 2024 presidential run, he pledged to "ban the worst agricultural chemicals already banned in other countries." But after he was sworn in as President Donald Trump's HHS Secretary, he began to sing a different tune. As Investigate Midwest noted, his "Make America Healthy Again" commission's introductory report made no mention of glyphosate. Meanwhile, he reassured the pesticide industry that it had nothing to worry about: "There’s a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model," he said during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. The Trump EPA has deregulated toxic chemicals across the board over the past year. It rolled back protections against per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals," in drinking water, which have many documented health risks. It has also declined to ban the widely used insecticide chlorpyrifos, which has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Elizabeth Kucinich, the former director of policy at the Center for Food Safety, described the US Department of Justice's effort to shield Bayer as another "betrayal of MAHA health promises." Her husband, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, worked as the campaign manager for RFK Jr.'s 2024 presidential bid. “This is regulatory capture, not public protection,” she said. “This action shields chemical manufacturers from accountability by elevating a captured federal regulatory process over the lived harm of real people. That is anti-life, and it is exactly what millions of MAHA voters believed they were voting against.” Food & Water Watch staff attorney Dani Replogle said the DOJ filing "encourages the Supreme Court to slam judiciary doors in the faces of cancer patients across the country." "No political posturing can undo the clear message this brief sends to sick Americans harmed by toxic pesticides," she continued. "Trump has Bayer’s back, not theirs."

Title: Betrayed American workers expose dark underbelly of H-1B visa scheme

By Jason Hopkins, Daily Caller News Foundation December 2, 2025 They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,’” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

After all, it’s not magic, it’s engineering. iPhone sales matter more than anything to Wall Street. Certainly, actual product sales should matter more than some potential A.I. nonsense. I’m glad Wall Street is somewhat coming to its senses. It irks me that so much emphasis is put on A.I. despite only a few hardware companies are profiting from it. There are so many data centers being built, and yet the demand for A.I. doesn’t really exist for most consumers. Is there even enough energy to go around to power all those data centers, especially when the summer heat arrives? Your email address will not be published.

Title: The World’s Second Biggest Bank Recommends Up To 4% Bitcoin Allocation In Portfolios
URL: https://zycrypto.com/the-worlds-second-biggest-bank-recommends-up-to-4-bitcoin-allocation-in-portfolios/

Bank of America, the second-largest bank in the world by market cap, has become the latest Wall Street titan to join the crypto rush. The bank says wealth clients should consider allocating up to 4% of their portfolios to crypto. Beginning Jan. 5, 2026, the bank’s wealth management advisors will be allowed to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to cryptocurrencies through the Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge platforms, according to a report from Yahoo Finance. Bank of America’s chief investment office will also begin coverage of four Bitcoin ETFs — BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, said in a statement. “The lower end of this range may be more appropriate for those with a conservative risk profile, while the higher end may suit investors with greater tolerance for overall portfolio risk,” Hyzy added. The development reverses Bank of America’s prior policy, which barred advisers from endorsing crypto unless a client explicitly requested access. That restriction effectively sidelined over 15,000 advisers during a period when institutional interest in regulated digital asset products was soaring. It comes a day after Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset management company, approved crypto ETF trading for its clients, marking a U-turn from its previous stance on digital asset ETFs. For many in the crypto industry, that major financial institutions such as Bank of America and Vanguard allow their clients to dabble in crypto is a sign of how far the nascent asset class has come since the days when certain banking execs labeled it a “fraud.” Notably, BlackRock was the first renowned Wall Street institution to advise interested investors to allocate as much as 2% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Back in June, asset management firm Fidelity also backed a 2% to 5% Bitcoin allocation, which was small enough to minimize the risk of a BTC crash, but big enough to enjoy any upside from the asset’s inflationary hedge. Morgan Stanley then issued a 2%–4% recommendation for “opportunistic portfolios” in October.

Title: You Won’t Believe How Much Bitcoin Companies Now Hold, What % Of Supply Do They Control?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitocin treasury companies continue to accumulate a significant amount of BTC despite current market conditions and now control around 5% of the total BTC supply. These companies are led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Metaplanet, which have recently raised fresh capital to buy the dip. Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that the top 100 public Bitcoin treasury companies currently hold 1,058,929 BTC, while all public companies combined hold 1,061,697. Notably, Strategy is the largest public Bitcoin holder with 650,000 BTC. Michael Saylor’s company yesterday announced another 130 BTC purchase for $11.7 million. Meanwhile, the second-largest Bitcoin treasury company is BTC miner MARA holdings, which holds 53,250 BTC. Tether-backed Twenty One Capital, Metaplanet, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company complete the top 5, with 43,514, 30,823, and 30,021 BTC, respectively. Meanwhile, companies like Coinbase, Bullish, and Trump Media are among the top 10 largest BTC treasury companies. It is worth noting that these public companies account for only a part of the Bitcoin treasuries. Further data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that there is currently 4 million BTC in treasuries as a whole, including the coins held by governments, private companies, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and ETFs. BlackRock is currently the second-largest Bitcoin holder, only behind Satoshi Nakamoto. Strategy is third on the list, while Binance and the U.S. government complete the top 5, with BTC holdings of 628,868 and 323,588, respectively. The 4 million BTC held by these treasury companies as a group accounts for 19% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet have raised new capital amid the recent crash to buy more BTC. Saylor’s company recently raised $836 million from its STRE offering, which it used to buy 8,178 BTC. Meanwhile, Metaplanet raised $130 million to expand its BTC treasury. More Bitcoin treasury companies are set to emerge as $10 trillion asset manager, Vanguard, will start offering BTC ETFs from today. Notably, some companies gain BTC exposure through these ETFs rather than buying Bitcoin directly. On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, holds $300 million worth of BlackRock’s BTC ETF. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin treasuries such as Strategy are coming under immense pressure amid the current market downtrend. Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, admitted that they might have to sell Bitcoin as a last resort to fund dividend payments if their mNAV drops below 1x and they can no longer raise capital. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Starting next year, investment strategies at Bank of America’s Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge platforms will support clients who want to allocate up to 4% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, the outlet reported. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, Bank of America Private Bank’s chief investment officer, reportedly said in a statement. Hyzy reportedly described “the lower end of this range” as suitable for investors with a conservative risk profile, with 4% being appropriate for those with high risk tolerances. On Jan. 5, Bank of America’s wealth management clients will also initiate coverage of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds from Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock, according to Yahoo Finance. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a Decrypt request for comment. Yahoo Finance reported that, historically, Bank of America’s wealth management clients were only able to access crypto-related products upon request. Previously, that left over 15,000 wealth advisors at the firm unable to make crypto-related recommendations. The shift comes as Bitcoin’s price jumped to near $91,600 at one point Tuesday. BTC was currently up 7.6% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value is off about 30% since hitting a record high above $126,000 in early October, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest investment companies, will soon begin letting people on its platform access crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds, Bloomberg reported on Monday. A Bitcoin-friendly CEO was appointed to the world’s second-largest asset manager in May. Last year, Fidelity suggested that people allocate between 2% and 5% to Bitcoin, with up to 7.5% being worth for young investors. Describing the asset as “unique,” the institution has explored allocations in hypothetical scenarios as early as 2020.

A FORMER SCHOOL teacher will be sentenced next week for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago at a private Dublin school. Peter Kelly (73) of Booterstown Park, Booterstown was convicted by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jury following a two week trial in November. He pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting the boys at Willow Park School, Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin on dates in the 70s and 80s. The school is run by the Spiritan order of priests Kelly was convicted on all charges. The eight victims are now all aged in their early 50s. Judge Elma Sheahan heard the victim impact statements of each of the men that had been abused by Kelly. Some of the men took the stand to read their own statements while Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick read others into the record. The men spoke of the various ways Kelly’s actions impacted their life, speaking of addictions, inabilities to deal with relationships, inabilities to express their emotions and inabilities to reach their full potential in adult life. Some of the men have spent time in psychiatric hospitals, others have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many of them are on medication for anxiety and depression. The men spoke of the loss of their education and suffering from insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. One victim spoke of an occasion as a child when he deliberately crashed his bike on the way to school. He was later treated in hospital because he had pretended he had injured his leg. He said in his victim impact statement that he did this so he could get out of school for some time and be away from Kelly. Many of the victims spoke of how their life could have been so different had they not been abused by Kelly and how as young children they never stood a chance against him. One of the victims spoke about how Kelly was “one cog in a machine of systematic abuse”. He said the school “tolerated widespread sexual abuse” and how “37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools” between both Willow Park and its feeder school Blackrock College. He said as children they had “no chance”. One of the victims told Kelly that he hopes he is made “confront the harm you have done”. This man also stated in his victim impact statement that he hopes “the court understands how you have not only violated the law but the life of a child and everything that he might have become”. Advertisement Another victim said he was “already vulnerable, already broken” when Kelly abused him as he had been the victim of “multiple sexual crimes committed by Kelly’s colleagues”. He said he was not abused “because I was chosen or groomed but because I was there in his classroom completely unable to protect myself”. “He used his position, he took advantage of my vulnerability and added to my pain,” the man continued. Kilpatrick outlined the incidences of abuse committed on each of the boys, who were mostly aged between 11 and 13 years old at the time. She said most of the abuse occurred in the classroom when Kelly would hold the child on his lap and molest them under the guise of tickling them. The victims said he would restrain them on his lap and bounce them up and down. He also played a game called ‘The Muppet Show’ during which he would take the child under the cloak he wore as a school teacher and again tickle them and then molest them. One of the victims was abused in the school’s rugby changing room. He described being laid across Kelly’s lap before he was abused. Others were abused in the school gym. Andrew Sexton SC, defending, told the judge that “there is not an acceptance of the verdict” before he added that Kelly never owned a passport. He said Kelly’s “entire life centred around the school and his home”, with his home being right beside the school. Counsel said the school implemented its own disciplinary regime following an initial complaint in the early 2000s, which was followed by a series of suspensions and which ultimately led to the end of Kelly’s career at the school with Kelly resigning his post in 2004. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute the allegations that had been made in the early 2000s. “He suffered the cessation of his life as a teacher and it was not replaced by anything else,” Sexton told the court. The judge said it was “very important to acknowledge that it had been a very difficult morning” for the six victims who were present in court. She pointed out that due to the law that existed at the time of Kelly’s offending the maximum penalty available to the court in most of the charges was ten years, while two of the offences allowed a penalty of up to two years in prison. The judge revoked Kelly’s bail and remanded him in custody pending sentence next Monday 8 December. She said he was to be given the medical attention he required having been informed that he has a number of medical conditions. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Who will be the next Fed chair?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Kevin Hassett appears to be Trump’s pick President Donald Trump says he has chosen the next chair of the Federal Reserve, but he is not yet naming names publicly. Current National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett is widely expected to be the nominee, said Axios. Trump is not saying. “I’m not telling you, we’ll be announcing it,” he said to reporters. The next chair will replace Jerome Powell, who has “faced months of complaints and demands” from Trump to bring interest rates down more quickly, said Axios. Powell’s term does not end until May, so he may have to spend the final months of his term with a “shadow chair” peering over his shoulder, said Fortune. Trump officials have signaled their desire to undercut Powell even if he remains in his position. With a shadow chair in place, “no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Barron’s last year. The question for Wall Street, then, is “will Powell or his successor hold more sway with the markets?” said Fortune. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. The likely choice of Hassett “appears to be about loyalty” to Trump, said John Authers at Bloomberg. Other possible nominees — including Bessent, as well as current Fed governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder — might feel compelled to “establish themselves as independent from the administration.” But being seen as a Trump loyalist could also force Hassett to prove his independence to “win the confidence of markets.” For now, though, “markets aren’t freaking out at the prospect of a Hassett chairmanship.” “Thank heavens” for Powell, said Brett Arends at MarketWatch. The latest numbers suggest the U.S. economy is “much stronger than people realized” even with the Fed chairman resisting Trump’s demanded rate cuts. If the president had gotten his way, the “likeliest scenario would be that inflation would be rocketing higher again.” Instead, the Federal Reserve has cut rates just twice this year and indicated another rate cut is unlikely in December. Americans should be grateful the current Fed chair has proven his independence and “refused to be intimidated” by Trump. Hassett would have “closer ties to the sitting president” than any modern Fed chair, said Axios. That might mean a quick drop in short-term rates, but long-term rates may stay high if Wall Street comes to believe he is “simply doing Trump’s bidding, with little regard for inflation.” That notion “might be difficult for a pick like Hassett to shake.” The next chair will face an unusually divided Fed board, said The Wall Street Journal. Fed chairs have ordinarily sought the “broadest possible consensus around rate decisions” and split votes have been rare. No longer. There is a “real prospect of three or more dissenting votes” at December’s meeting, whether Powell decides to pause rate cuts or continue them. “It’s not a slam dunk” that Trump’s choice will dictate policy as much as his predecessors, said Krishna Guha, a former New York Fed executive.

Title: Bank of America says clients can allocate up to 4% to crypto

Bank of America’s new guidance lets advisers actively recommend Bitcoin ETFs, signaling rising institutional confidence despite the market pullback. Bank of America has officially opened the door for its wealth management clients to include crypto in their portfolios. They are recommending a 1%–4% allocation through regulated Bitcoin ETFs beginning 5 January 5. However, beyond the headline, what stands out is the timing of this shift — it arrives during a broad market pullback, not at a cycle peak. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, according to new data (from CoinMarketCap. That’s down sharply from $3.71T last month, yet still well above the $2.42T yearly low. Source: CoinMarketCap This paints a very different backdrop from the euphoric rallies that typically precede new institutional endorsements. Instead, BofA’s guidance lands during a corrective phase, suggesting the bank views crypto as a long-term asset class rather than short-term speculation. According to reports, beginning 5 January, Bank of America’s CIO office will formally cover and recommend four spot Bitcoin ETFs: This is the first time advisors on Merrill, Private Bank, and Merrill Edge can proactively recommend crypto exposure — a major shift from the previous “request-only” framework that kept many clients from accessing the asset class. CIO Chris Hyzy framed the allocation as appropriate for investors “with interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility,” emphasizing regulated products and risk-aligned sizing [1–4%]. Crypto’s market cap has cooled from its late-summer highs, mirroring Bitcoin’s fall from above $126,000 to the mid-$80,000 range. Yet institutions are increasing, not decreasing, their engagement: The trend shows that Wall Street wants regulated crypto exposure integrated into traditional portfolios, even during downturns. This suggests a growing institutional consensus that crypto markets have matured sufficiently to withstand — and potentially benefit from — cyclical volatility. By allowing crypto allocations at a moment when the total market cap has dipped nearly $600 billion in a month, Bank of America is signaling: It’s a different kind of institutional endorsement — one that doesn’t chase hype but leans into market structure, regulation, and portfolio construction.

Title: ‘Big Short’ Michael Burry says Bitcoin worse than tulip bubble

Share this article Investor Michael Burry, best known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, criticized Bitcoin on a podcast, comparing it to the historical tulip bubble and expressing skepticism about its valuation and utility. “It’s not worth anything. Everybody’s accepted it. It’s the tulip bulb of our time,” Burry said. “It’s worse than a tulip bulb, because this has enabled so much criminal activity to go deep under.” The hedge fund manager, who has recently made headlines for placing bearish bets against Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR), called the fact that Bitcoin reached $100,000 is “the most ridiculous thing.” “That same people are sitting on TV talking about Bitcoin. They’re just casually, it’s $100,000, it’s down, now it’s $98,000,” he said. Despite dropping below $84,000 on Monday, Bitcoin reclaimed $90,000 after the US market opening. The digital asset was trading at around $90,600 at press time, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours. It’s not the first time Michael Burry has criticized Bitcoin. In early 2021, he called it a “speculative bubble” comparable to the dot-com and housing bubbles, despite its growing relevance and popularity. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value since then.

Meesho Ltd. received strong institutional participation in its pre-IPO anchor round, raising Rs 2,440 crore on Tuesday. Marque foreign entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, Government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Schroder Group, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were allotted shares. Nearly 22 crore equity shares were subscribed at the IPO price of Rs 111 apiece, according to a stock exchange filing. Out of the total allocation, nearly 43% were allocated to 14 domestic mutual funds through a total of 52 schemes. These include SBI Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life, Axis Mutual Fund, Mirae, UTI Mutual Fund, Tata Mutual Fund, Motilal Oswal and HSBC Mutual Fumd, among many others. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg News reported several major investors pulled out of Meesho's anchor round when the Indian e-commerce firm allocated about a quarter of the shares in this tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt. Among those who withdrew were Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., Nippon India Life Asset Management Ltd. and Nomura Asset Management, the report said. Notably, Meesho's anchor report did not feature any of these names. Meesho will launch its IPO on Wednesday. The IPO will include a mix of fresh issues of shares worth Rs 4,250 crore and an offer for sale of 10 crore shares by existing shareholders. The price band for the issue is set at Rs 105 to Rs 111 per share. Vidit Aatry and Sanjeev Kumar are the promoter selling shareholders offloading stakes in the OFS segment. Peak XV Partners, Elevation Capital V Ltd., Venture Highway Series 1, Golden Summit Ltd., Y Combinator Continuity Holding I, LLC, Sarin Family India LLC and Gemini Investmets are corporate selling shareholders that are selling stake.

Sudeep Pharma will list on the BSE and NSE on Dec. 10.

The company will also use Rs 1,020 crore for expenditure towards marketing and brand initiatives in its subsidiary Meesho Technologies. The latest GMP for Meesho IPO was Rs 46.5. With a price band cap of Rs 111, the estimated listing price for Meesho shares is Rs 157.5. This implies an expected gain of 42% per share.

Wealthfront plans to market shares for $12 to $14 each, according to its filing on Tuesday with the SEC. It is offering 21.47 million shares, while some of its backers are offering 13.15 million shares. December 2, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wealthfront Corp. and some of its shareholders are seeking to raise $485 million as the robo-advisory firm seeks to go public. The Palo Alto, California-based company plans to market shares for $12 to $14 each, according to its filing on Tuesday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Wealthfront is offering 21.47 million shares, while some of its backers are offering 13.15 million shares. At the top of that range, Wealthfront would have a market value of around $2.05 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filing. Funds run by BlackRock Inc. and Wellington Management may buy up to $150 million of IPO shares, according to the filing. Wealthfront is best known for its automated investing products and an online platform that’s attracted younger customers. The fintech also offers other bank-like services, including high-yield savings accounts. It has $88.2 billion of platform assets as of July 31, the filing shows. The company had net income of $60.7 million on revenue of $175.6 million for the six months ended July 31, compared with net income of $132.3 million on revenue of $145.9 million a year earlier, according to an earlier filing. Net income in the six-month period to July 31 included a $13.3 million provision for income tax, versus a tax benefit of $54.1 million in the corresponding period in 2024, the filing shows. Wealthfront’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased 16% year over year.

Title: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/4355628/posts
Time Published: 2025-12-02T16:23:31Z
Full Content:
Skip to comments. Posted on 12/02/2025 8:23:31 AM PST by DFG They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

If you manage to get hired they will do what they can to drive you out of that position. 5 posted on 12/02/2025 8:43:21 AM PST by Mr. K (no i think 10%consequence of repealing obamacare is worse than obamacare itself.)

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program.

About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Title: Why Morgan Stanley just got more bullish on Nvidia stock, even as it struggles

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia has been under pressure in recent weeks amid a rethink of the AI trade, but one top bank says investors don't have much of a reason to worry about the chip king. Nvidia stock is down 9% over the last month. Even its blockbuster third-quarter earnings failed to generate new excitement for the company and the broader AI sector. Big-name investors like Peter Thiel and SoftBank have dumped the stock, adding pressure. But Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore this week pushed back on the downbeat narratives, increasing the bank's price target for the stock to $250 from $235 on Monday. The new target is among the highest on Wall Street, and implies a nearly 40% jump from current levels. Moore said that he thinks threats to the AI leader's market share, specifically those in Asian markets, are overstated. Speculation that Nvidia's dominance in the AI market may be threatened isn't new. Ever since the AI leader shot to the top of the tech sector following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investors have wondered how long it can maintain the rank as the top AI hardware maker. Morgan Stanley doesn't see any other chipmakers as posing a significant threat to Nvidia, though, even as China prioritizes building out its own domestic semiconductor supply chain. The analysts recently visited Asia and shared their take on why Nvidia shouldn't be worried about competition from the east. "While there is much attention being paid to Chinese AI solutions, we think that they are very limited on multiple levels, including cluster size and scale out technologies, and China software still would like access to western solutions," the analysts stated in a note on Monday. Moore also said his team reconciled the ambitious $500 billion estimate for chip revenue given by CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's GTC event in October. "Having met with several contacts in both Asia and in the US, we are comfortable increasing estimates to get revenues to that level." While the analysts increased their price targets for both Nvidia and fellow chipmaker Broadcom, they said they still see Nvidia as the sector's clear winner. "We model for AVGO and AMD to grow their AI processor revenues slightly faster than NVDA in CY26, but that mostly just reflects supply chain limitations of a $205 bn run rate revenue stream - all key products are supply constrained through 2026," the note stated. The analysts are convinced that even as competition in the AI chip market intensifies, Nvidia will still maintain the best performance-to-cost ratio and be able to access a wider range of AI applications and workloads than its competitors.

Title: Former teacher Kelly was 'one cog in machine of abuse'

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent A former maths teacher at a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in South Dublin will be sentenced next week for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Peter Kelly who is 73 and was a maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock for almost thirty years, was found guilty by a jury earlier this year of 28 counts of indecent assault. One victim told the court, Kelly was "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse" at Willow Park, and secondary school, Blackrock College. Peter Kelly began teaching at Willow Park Primary school in 1977. He resigned in 2004 after an investigation following a complaint made in 2001. The DPP decided not to prosecute him at that stage. Earlier this year however, he went on trial at the Circuit Criminal Court, charged with 28 counts of indecent assault against eight boys. All the boys were aged between around 10 and 13 years old when the assaults took place. Some of the offences took place in the classroom, some in changing rooms. Kelly denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury last month. The court heard he doesn't accept the jury's verdicts. Many of the boys gave evidence that Kelly wore a black gown and would put boys under his gown and cuddle and fondle them - something he referred to as "the Muppet show". He would also tickle boys, calling it "death by tickles", slap them, bounce them on his crotch and touch their genital areas or make them touch his. The boys also gave evidence of physical punishment, although this did not form part of the charges against Kelly. However the prosecution case was that he used physical and sexual violence to demean the boys in his class. The boys are now men in their fifties and the court heard emotional and moving victim impact statements from all eight of them. Some of the men read their own statements, some were read by investigating garda inspector Rachel Kilpatrick. Most of the men described suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Some had struggled with addiction and lived with self doubt, fear, depression and anxiety. The first man to give his victim impact statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he didn't want Kelly near him, but he couldn't get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do make sure Kelly wouldn't notice him so he wouldn't touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he wouldn't have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse hadn't happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it couldn't just have been him. The man told the court he had always hated himself for letting Kelly beat him mentally but only now could he see that he never stood a chance at 11 years old. Another man described the severe impact the abuse had had on his physical and mental health. He said his health had deteriorated and his ability to work had been affected. He too had been diagnosed with PTSD and he said his symptoms had placed a tremendous strain on his family and on his marriage. This man told the prosecuting counsel, John Griffin, that Kelly had worked in an institution which "tolerated widespread physical and mental abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College". He said 37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools and Kelly was just "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse". "We as children, had no chance," he said. A third victim of Kelly's abuse told the court he had already been broken by abuse carried out against him by another teacher, Edward Baylor, who has since died. He said Kelly, instead of supporting him as a vulnerable person, took advantage of his vulnerability and added to his pain. He said Kelly's abuse reinforced his shame and intensified his sense that there was no escape. This man told the court he had lived with pain and damage ever since, and the loss of what his life should have been. He said he was desperate to be invisible at school, his grades plummeted and his future changed course. He left Ireland as a young man, he told the court, and now feels he needs to leave again as it is too painful to stay here. This man broke down as he told the court he felt useless and that he was "never getting out of this". He said it had taken him years to be able to speak about it and that he was "so very, very tired". He told Kelly he hoped he was being made to confront what he had done. Other victims also wrote of feeling terrified of Kelly and of suffering from depression and anxiety later in life. Defence counsel, Andrew Sexton told the court Kelly's entire life had centred around Willow Park and Blackrock College until he resigned in 2004. He said he had medical and physical issues of significance and his health was deteriorating. He has no other convictions. Judge Elma Sheahan said it had been a very difficult morning for victims and she needed time to consider all she had heard. She said she would sentence Kelly next week and remanded him in custody in the meantime. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former Willow Park primary school teacher to be sentenced over abuse of eight boys
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/02/former-willow-park-primary-school-teacher-to-be-sentenced-over-abuse-of-eight-boys/
Time Published: 2025-12-02T15:25:43Z
Full Content:
A former teacher at Willow Park primary school in south Dublin will be sentenced next week for the indecent assault of eight boys more than 30 years ago. The school, located on the grounds of Blackrock College, was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, now the Spiritans. One survivor of the abuse inflicted by Peter Kelly told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that his former teacher had worked for an institution “that tolerated widespread sexual abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College”. “Thirty-seven abusers were identified in this, he was a mere cog in a machine of systematic abuse. We as children had no chance.” Kelly (73), who grew up in Booterstown and taught maths at the school from 1977 until 2004, had pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting eight boys in the 1970s and the 1980s at Willow Park primary school. He was convicted last month of all 28 counts after a trial before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. The jury returned majority verdicts, following more than seven hours of deliberation. The matter was adjourned for a sentencing hearing before Judge Elma Sheahan, who on Tuesday heard victim impact statements from all eight complainants who were aged between 10 and 13 at the time of the offences. Having also heard submissions on behalf of barrister John Griffin, for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), and Andrew Sexton SC, Kelly’s barrister, the judge said she had a lot to consider and would pass sentence on December 8th. Because of different legislation applying in different years to the offences, the maximum penalties are two years in some cases and 10 years in others. In mitigation submissions, Mr Sexton said his client has spent his entire life around his home in Booterstown and the school, and prison would be difficult for a man of his age. There was no acceptance by Kelly of the jury’s verdict, counsel also said. A complaint against Kelly was made in 2001 and a decision was made by the DPP not to prosecute, counsel also said. Six complainants were in court to read their statements while statements from the remaining two were read by Insp Rachel Kilpatrick, who was involved from 2021 in a large scale Garda investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College and Willow Park primary school. Insp Kilpatrick said Kelly had made no admissions during two interviews with gardaí before his being charged with the offences. A number of complainants referred to Kelly engaging in what was known as the “Muppet Show” in the classroom, in which he would take a boy under his black cloak and, under the guise of tickling them, would run his hands up and down their torsos and buttocks. Kelly had also pulled some complainants on to his lap and bounced them aggressively up and down in front of the class while pushing his body against their backs. The judge was also told Kelly had brought some boys to stand in front of the class, stood behind them and took hold of their hands and moved their hands up and down all over their bodies while standing close behind them and pushing his body into theirs. One complainant described this as akin to “a humiliation ritual”. Many of the offences took place in the classroom but one complainant was assaulted on four occasions by Kelly in a rugby changing room, including being held face down across Kelly’s knee while the teacher slapped his bottom and pushed him up towards his penis. Another complainant was assaulted where gym equipment was stored, involving being made bend over a gym horse and having his buttocks rubbed and slapped. One complainant had alleged, during an occasion when he was held back at school by Kelly, the teacher had put his hands inside his underpants and digitally penetrated his anus. All eight statements outlined serious adverse impacts of the abuse by Kelly. Some suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and some spoke of experiencing suicidal ideation. One complainant said he always had a sense of “danger and dread” around Kelly. Not only had the teacher abused him, he “controlled me mentally”, the man said. As a result of Kelly’s abuse, he hated everything to do with school, stopped all sports and gave up his goals, he said. In adult life, he could never face situations without severe anger, trauma and anxiety, he said. It was only after he underwent counselling that he saw he never had a chance. Another complainant said that, as a result of Kelly’s abuse, he did not like it when his father hugged him after he did well at school or sports. He had never had any counselling but intended to when the criminal process was over, the man said. A third complainant said he spent long periods in psychiatric hospitals due to the abuse and was diagnosed with PTSD. His personal and professional life were very seriously affected, he said. Another man said he suffered depression, social anxiety and PTSD, as well as trust issues. Only when he began therapy in his 40s had his situation started to improve, he said. Another said he became a “hollow shell of a human” and was unable to cry as a child and into later life, either for himself or others. He had used alcohol and drugs for a long time in an effort to stop negative thoughts. Insomnia and addiction issues were cited by another survivor who said he contacted gardaí after seeing RTÉ’s Late Late Show address issues about abuse in schools run by the Spiritans. Another survivor said, when Kelly abused him, he was already vulnerable and broken as a result of “multiple sexual crimes” by another person. He continues to experience serious difficulties daily as a result of the abuse, he said. Another survivor said he became withdrawn and “dark and brooding” following the abuse and did not speak out because he felt there was an air of “don’t speak, don’t tell”. The “sense of being alone” might sum it up best, he said.

Title: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/12/02/american-workers-betrayed-by-h-1b-visas/
Time Published: 2025-12-02T15:01:09Z

They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” (RELATED: Major Democrat Donor Has Sizeable Stake In Pot Company Raided By ICE) “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY – AUGUST 08: An employee works in a 3-D scan lab at GE Appliances on August 08, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Michael Hickey/Getty Images for GE Appliances, a Haier company) Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. WASHINGTON, DC – SEPTEMBER 19: President Donald Trump holds up an executive order establishing the “Trump Gold Card” in the Oval Office at the White House on September 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Title: Meesho Faces Investor Protest Over Anchor Allotment To SBI Funds

Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book faced a setback after several major investors pulled out when the Indian e-commerce firm was said to have allocated about a quarter of the shares in this tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., the country’s largest asset manager, according to people familiar with the matter. That decision triggered a pushback from other large funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Meesho is set to open its anchor book — a portion of shares reserved for institutional investors — on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that launches on Wednesday. Among those who withdrew were Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., Nippon India Life Asset Management Ltd. and Nomura Asset Management, the people said. Many had sought allocations on par with those of SBI Funds and opted out in what was viewed as a protest, they added. Even so, Meesho’s anchor lineup features several global investors, including sovereign wealth funds such as GIC Pte and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, alongside major long-only investors like Fidelity International, BlackRock Inc., Baillie Gifford, as well as global firms like WCM Investment Management and Dragoneer Investment Group LLC, the people said. To be sure, the anchor allotment process is still ongoing, and the final investor lineup may change. The episode underscores the intense demand for India’s tech startups as they move toward public listings. Recent IPOs from digital platforms including Urban Co. and Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. — the parent of discount broker Groww — have drawn heavy demand, reflecting consumers’ rapid shift toward online services and commerce. Representatives for Capital Group and Aberdeen declined to comment. Spokespersons at Meesho, SBI Funds and the other investors didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Bengaluru-based marketplace, which links small manufacturers with price-sensitive consumers in smaller Indian cities, aims to raise as much as 54.2 billion rupees ($603 million). The shares are priced in a range of 105 rupees to 111 rupees apiece, according to a newspaper advertisement published Friday. Existing shareholders, including Elevation Capital V Ltd., Peak XV Partners Investments V and Meesho’s founders will sell shares in the offering.

Bank of America, one of the U.S.’s largest financial institutions, has become the latest Wall Street giant to warm up to bitcoin BTC$93,163.16. Beginning in January, the bank's wealth management advisers will be allowed to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to crypto assets, according to Yahoo Finance. Initially, the BofA/Merrill Lynch thundering herd will focus on four spot bitcoin ETFs — BlackRock's IBIT, Fidelity's FBTC, Bitwise's BITB and Grayscale's BTC. It's a major change for the bank, which previously allowed its clientele to invest as they wish, but did not allow its advisors to recommend crypto exposure. The news comes just hours after asset management titan Vanguard reversed its long-standing policy and will now allow its clients access to crypto ETFs. The move also brings BofA in line with the wealth management platforms of other major institutions like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley. The action also likely ups the pressure on the dwindling number of holdouts, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and UBS among them. "For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate," Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, said in a statement. "The lower end of this range may be more appropriate for those with a conservative risk profile, while the higher end may suit investors with greater tolerance for overall portfolio risk," Hyzy added.

Title: Warner Bros.’ Bidding War Escalates: Here Are the Challenges Facing Comcast, Netflix and Paramount | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The three companies are in hot pursuit for all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery, but they each have their own regulatory and political hurdles As Warner Bros. Discovery’s board mulls over a second round of bids from Paramount, Comcast and Netflix, a factor it’ll have to consider is just how easily a deal will get approved by regulators. That was the crux of a lot of the chatter that emerged in the days leading up to the Monday deadline, which saw the three companies submitting new, binding offers for all or parts of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to various press reports. Netflix showing strong interest in WBD’s assets, including making a mostly cash offer to acquire them, coincided with reports that the White House had antitrust concerns, while Comcast, which also submitted a bid, still has to deal with the challenge that President Donald Trump loathes CEO Brian Roberts. Paramount also reportedly sweetened its bid with a reported all-cash offer financed by asset management firm Apollo Group and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and is selling itself as the easiest path to getting its deal done thanks to CEO David Ellison and his father’s cushy relationship with Trump. The new round of bids and the chatter signals how the stakes have gone up in the race for WBD. The winner would gain valuable streaming, IP and studio assets and, in the case of Paramount, also expand its cable TV footprint. Any of the three scenarios will lead to a massive reshaping of the entertainment industry and a further consolidation of power in Hollywood. TheWrap previously reported that a final decision is expected to be made around Christmas. Netflix and Paramount declined to comment, although a Paramount representative did not respond to a later request for a comment on the prospect of the sovereign wealth funds participating, which TheWrap previously reported on. Representatives for Warner Bros. and Comcast did not immediately return a request for comment. Until then, here’s a rundown of where each bidder stands and some of the regulatory challenges they each face. Out of all the players, Paramount Skydance would have the easiest time acquiring WBD, mostly because it has already played this game. The company is fresh off Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, which cleared in August. Since it already secured FCC approval from the Trump administration before, several experts, including LightShed Partners partner and technology analyst Rich Greenfield, have noted that the previous acquisition puts Paramount on the regulatory “fast track.” Another thing working in Paramount’s favor is its interest in the company overall as well as its deep pockets. Out of the three companies interested in bidding on Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount is the only one that wants the full company and not just the Warner Bros. studio and streaming division. Yep, it wants cable too. Paramount noted it would increase the amount paid in cash to shareholders from 60% to 80%, bumping up the breakup fee from $2 billion to $2.1 billion. It’s also clear that Paramount really really wants this. Whereas Comcast and Netflix only submitted one previous bid, this marks Paramount Skydance’s fourth bid. The first three were rejected for being too low. Additionally, Zaslav may be personally interested in selling to Paramount. CEO Ellison offered Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman title as part of his Warner offer. So what’s working against Paramount? Concerns over the theatrical division will be a hurdle, since Paramount acquiring WBD will drop the number of major film studios from five to four. But perhaps the main obstacle to clear is one that can’t be measured by hard financial figures. It’s only been four months since Ellison took control of Paramount. So far, the only things to come out of that acquisition have been a lot of layoffs and departures (bye, over 1,000 employees and gone-in-2028 Taylor Sheridan) as well as several headline grabbing deals (“South Park” and UFC’s deals are in the billions). Simply put, it’s way too early to know if the Ellison era is a good — and lucrative — era of the company. Despite the creative-friendly reputation Ellison has in the industry, that’s sure to be a concern. At first glance, Comcast taking over Warner Bros. makes the most sense. Both companies house legacy Hollywood institutions — NBCUniversal and Warner Bros., respectively. Thanks to its movie studio arm, Comcast understands the challenges of theatrical, and because of Peacock, it understands the headaches around streaming. Comcast is also reportedly the preferred option for WBD head Zaslav. Two struggling giants teaming up to combat this difficult landscape is a matchup that works, like Godzilla and King Kong teaming up to take down the Skar King (IP, folks!). The problems come down to money, possible theatrical overreach and Trump. It’s widely believed that Comcast’s pockets aren’t as deep as the Ellison family’s Oracle-powered fortune. That being said, according to the New York Post, Comcast CEO Roberts was considering a potential offer that could reach as high as $28 a share for just the studio and streaming business. As for the theatrical side of the business, Comcast will face the same questions as Paramount. At the moment, there are only five major movie studios: Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures. Two of them being owned by the same company will raise some regulatory eyebrows no matter which companies are involved. Other than cash, it’s the Trump administration that may also pose a major threat to Comcast scooping up Warner Bros. The president has been outspoken about his dislike of Roberts, calling the CEO “a disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting” on Truth Social. Though NBCUniversal will be spinning its cable assets off into Versant sometime early next year, Comcast’s ownership of MSNBC (now MS NOW) could rub Trump the wrong way. Comcast also owns NBC, which is home to Seth Meyers’ “Late Night,” which last month drew Trump’s ire as he called for the host to be fired. As the “60 Minutes” lawsuit ahead of Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount demonstrated, Trump isn’t above dangling FCC approval to make major media networks act the way he wants. Like Comcast, Netflix only wants Warner Bros., which encompasses Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming and studio divisions. Let’s start with the positives. Warner Bros. Discovery has warmed up to Netflix’s potential bid, Gasparino reported. Netflix has always had a healthy respect for Warner. Way back in 2012, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos famously said, “We’re going to become HBO before HBO could become us.” Acquiring the company behind HBO — especially during a time when Netflix is interested in “selective” merger and acquisition deals — would be a big step in that direction. Netflix also has deep pockets and has proven it’s willing to overspend to get what it wants. But that’s about where the pro-Netflix argument ends. Because Netflix is notoriously against showing movies in theaters, its interest in acquiring one of the five big movie studios has ruffled the feathers of many in the industry, especially since theater attendance is down nearly 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros., it’s hard to say whether it would abandon its current strategy and lean into theaters or if it would continue to make its movies streaming-first. And if Netflix did lean into theaters, that leads to a whole other set of issues. Netflix would have to learn the international theatrical ropes in a very short amount of time. But the biggest argument against Netflix is that it’s simply too big. Netflix is consistently the top premium streamer when it comes to Nielsen’s monthly The Gauge reports. If it were to acquire HBO Max as well, the ensuing streamer would be an even bigger behemoth in a landscape where it dominates. Government officials are already thinking about antitrust concerns if there is a Netflix acquisition. That potential investigation has been compared to the lengthy antitrust investigations Google and Amazon underwent and that Netflix has avoided so far. Overcoming those regulatory hurdles from the Department of Justice would likely take more than two years before it even goes to court, according to the New York Post. It’s unclear if Netflix or Warner Bros. would want to undergo this joint headache. Ironically, what could save Netflix is YouTube. If the case can be made that YouTube, which consistently leads the Nielsen charts, is the actual entertainment leader, Netflix may be able to acquire Warner Bros. without antitrust concerns. It just comes down to how well YouTube’s user-generated content can be separated from Netflix’s premium content.

Business CEO of Dell Technologies Michael Dell participates an Invest America Roundtable in the State Dining room, at the White House, in Washington, U.S., June 9, 2025. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein WASHINGTON, Dec 2 : Entrepreneur Michael Dell and his wife, Susan, will deposit $250 in the individual investment accounts of 25 million American children in a $6.25 billion philanthropic pledge as part of the Trump administration's Invest America initiative. The initiative, known as "Trump accounts", was created this year under President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and has sparked a scramble by financial firms looking to participate. The U.S. Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for all children born between 2025 and 2028. The Invest America accounts are expected to open on July 4 next year, but details about how they will work are still unknown. The funds - required to be invested in an index fund that mirrors the performance of the broader stock market - become available at the age of 18 for education, job training, a first home or starting a business. "We believe the smartest investment that we can make is an investment in children," Michael Dell said at a White House event announcing the donation.

Title: Cardano’s Hoskinson Reveals the Way Forward for Crypto Market, Shares Optimistic Expectations

Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson believes the current crypto market downturn is unlikely to persist, arguing that the market has shifted far beyond the retail-driven cycles of previous years. Speaking in a recent interview, Hoskinson noted that the arrival of major financial institutions and the U.S. government has fundamentally changed the market’s structure and its long-term trajectory. Responding to a question about whether a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration could soften the impact of the current drawdown, Hoskinson said this cycle stands apart from earlier ones. “The last three times it was retail-led,” he explained. “But this time around, you have BlackRock and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and the U.S. government, all others coming in.” The Cardano co-founder added that a growing portion of crypto now represents real-world assets, pointing to the rapid expansion of stablecoins, which have surpassed $250 billion in issuance and could exceed $1 trillion by 2030. Hoskinson also highlighted projections that between $10 trillion worth of equities and other traditional assets could move on-chain by the mid-2030s. Combined with a potential rise in global crypto users from 550 million today to nearly one billion, the sector’s foundation is stronger than short-term sentiment suggests. “There’s no way for these markets to stay depressed forever,” Hoskinson said, framing current prices as a reflection of macro uncertainty rather than deteriorating fundamentals. That uncertainty is visible on market dashboards. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index recently plunged to 6, one of its lowest readings ever. Meanwhile, analysts noted that short-term profit-and-loss metrics have fallen even more sharply than during the COVID-19 and FTX crashes. Nevertheless, some analysts are calling the downturn an opportunity, urging traders to “buy the dip.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are flashing mixed signals. Bitcoin wavers between institutional outflows, renewed whale accumulation, and questions surrounding its upcoming quantum-resistant upgrade. Ethereum faces regulatory delays, proposed staking reward cuts, and persistent whale buying even as retail holders exit. At the time of writing, the crypto market stands at a total valuation of $2.96 trillion.

Title: Bank of America backs 1–4% crypto allocation, opens gates to Bitcoin ETFs

Bank of America’s wealthiest clients will gain access to Bitcoin ETFs, while its network of over 15,000 wealth advisers can recommend crypto exposure for the first time, Yahoo reported. More big-name financial institutions are opening the door to Bitcoin exposure, signaling a growing institutional appetite for regulated digital asset products. Bank of America, the second-largest US bank, reportedly recommended a 1%–4% cryptocurrency allocation to its wealth management clients through the Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank and Merrill Edge platforms, according to a statement shared with Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” said Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, in the statement shared with Yahoo. Starting Jan. 5, the bank will enable its clients to gain access to four new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The development will enable the bank’s wealthiest clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, which were previously only available upon request. The bank’s over 15,000 wealth advisers were unable to recommend any cryptocurrency investment products. “Our guidance emphasizes regulated vehicles, thoughtful allocation, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and risks,” added the bank’s chief investment officer. The bank’s Bitcoin allocation recommendation is signaling a wider institutional appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment products. It comes a day after Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, enabled crypto ETF trading for its clients, reversing its previous stance on digital asset ETFs. Cointelegraph has contacted Bank of America for more details on its crypto allocation recommendations. Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the US with about $2.67 trillion in consolidated assets and over 3,600 branches, according to Forbes. Related: Bitcoin to end four-year cycle, break out to new highs in 2026: Grayscale BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, was the first big institution to recommend an up to 2% Bitcoin allocation to its clients, Cointelegraph reported in December 2024. Around 1%–2% is a “reasonable range for Bitcoin exposure,” which poses the “same share of overall portfolio risk” as a typical allocation to “the ‘magnificent 7’ group of mostly mega-cap tech stocks,” wrote BlackRock in a report at the time. The “magnificent 7” refers to Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia. Related: Cathie Wood still bullish on $1.5M Bitcoin price target: Finance Redefined In June, asset management firm Fidelity also recommended a 2% to 5% Bitcoin allocation, which was small enough to minimize the risk of a Bitcoin crash, but large enough to enjoy any upside from BTC’s inflationary hedge. Earlier in October, Morgan Stanley also suggested a 2% to 4% allocation to crypto portfolios for investors and financial advisers, further signaling that large financial institutions are moving toward a shared playbook of modest, risk-managed exposure to digital assets.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Dec. 2, Vanguard will reportedly open its massive brokerage platform to spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This strategic volte-face ends the asset manager’s steadfast isolation from the $3 trillion digital asset market. For years, Vanguard stood as the most prominent holdout of the crypto space, driven by a philosophy that viewed the high volatility of digital assets as fundamentally incompatible with the principles of long-term, diversified portfolio construction. This reversal, therefore, represents one of the most significant capitulations in the traditional finance sector’s gradual embrace of the crypto economy. Crucially, Vanguard said it is not deviating from its core manufacturing philosophy. So, it would not be launching its own proprietary crypto funds. Instead, it will serve as a critical gateway, allowing its conservative client base to access regulated products managed by rival issuers such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and Bitwise Asset Management. Speaking on the broader significance of the move, Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, noted the stark contrast between the magnitude of the policy shift and the market’s muted reaction, a sign of the asset class’s maturity. He noted: “The 2nd largest brokerage in America flips its policy from sell-only to allowing crypto ETF purchases. And no one is fired up. Whether people are stoked right now or not — crypto is rapidly entering the mainstream.” The firm’s restrictions on crypto ETFs had remained firmly in place even after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin funds in early 2024 and the first Ethereum products later that year. Notably, Vanguard’s internal client guidelines and platform eligibility rules kept those ETFs from its self-directed brokerage system, citing regulatory ambiguity and investor protection concerns. However, the calculus changed following a sweeping shift in the regulatory environment under the current US administration. The SEC’s pivot toward a pro-innovation stance, combined with years of court decisions, effectively evaporated the regulatory uncertainty that Vanguard had long cited as a barrier. Indeed, the approvals of spot crypto ETFs were underpinned by robust frameworks that establish how surveillance-sharing agreements, custody arrangements, and disclosure standards apply to digital assets. These frameworks, first battle-tested with Bitcoin ETFs, became the template for subsequent products, significantly reducing the operational risk for brokers offering access through retail platforms. Furthermore, the move is an acknowledgment of irrefutable market realities. A recent study found that 35% of younger, wealthy Americans have left their financial advisors because they do not allow access to crypto. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the fastest-growing ETFs in US history, demonstrating that demand for crypto exposure had decisively shifted from niche trading platforms to mainstream asset managers. Today, spot Bitcoin funds manage approximately $120 billion in assets across issuers, while Ethereum ETFs collectively hold nearly $20 billion. At the same time, newer products tracking Solana and XRP are succeeding, thanks to strong market demand. Beyond regulation, the absence of crypto access had become a burgeoning competitive liability for Vanguard. Notably, many clients already held crypto ETFs in accounts outside Vanguard while maintaining traditional holdings on the platform. This bifurcation forced advisors to route trades through separate institutions, complicating processes such as tax-loss harvesting and model portfolio management. So, this decision acknowledges that clients seeking exposure through regulated ETFs should be able to execute those trades within their primary Vanguard accounts rather than migrating capital to outside brokers. Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, reportedly said: “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity. The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured, and investor preferences continue to evolve.” The direct impact on ETF flows will depend on how Vanguard’s unique client base responds. Vanguard manages more than $9.3 trillion in assets, but the addressable market for these products is narrower because only self-directed brokerage and IRA accounts are authorized to trade them. Institutional mandates, defined benefit plans, and other pooled vehicles generally remain restricted from such allocations. Moreover, Vanguard clients exhibit behavior distinct from the active traders who drove early crypto ETF inflows. This demographic favors passive, long-dated index products over thematic or tactical funds. As a result, initial allocations are expected to be modest. Still, a penetration rate of roughly 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible brokerage assets would imply early flows in the low-single-digit billions, spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP funds. Meanwhile, the significance of Vanguard’s entry lies not in the velocity of the flows, but in the stickiness of the capital. Unlike the “mercenary capital” of hedge funds or the reactive flows of retail day traders, Vanguard inflows tend to be price-agnostic and permanent. So, in a standard “60/40/1” portfolio—allocated to equities, bonds, and crypto respectively—automated systems maintain target weightings by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. If the price of Bitcoin or Solana drops, the portfolio algorithmically buys more to restore the 1% weighting. This creates a structural “buy the dip” mechanism that could dampen volatility and raise floor prices over a full market cycle. Moreover, broader distribution typically improves liquidity. The influx of Vanguard’s diversified volume is expected to narrow bid-ask spreads and reduce execution costs for all investors, further tightening the efficiency of ETF arbitrage mechanisms and the responsiveness of pricing to underlying market movements. As a result, even a conservative adoption curve could have outsized impacts. So, if only a fraction of Vanguard’s client base allocates a standard 1% to 2% “satellite” position to crypto ETFs, it represents tens of billions of dollars in net new demand.

Title: 11 Trillion Asset Management Giant Vanguard To Allow Bitcoin, Ether, And XRP ETF Trading In Stunning About-Turn

Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, is set to allow its clients to start trading crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds on its platform, abandoning its previous anti-crypto stance that had kept digital-asset offerings off its shelves for years. Starting Tuesday, Vanguard will allow trading in funds that hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, and Solana (SOL), similar to how the firm treats gold, according to a Monday report from Bloomberg. “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” Andrew Kadjeski, Vanguard’s head of brokerage and investments, told Bloomberg. “The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve.” Notably, funds linked to memecoins or those not supported by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will remain barred. Moreover, Vanguard has no immediate plans to create its own crypto products. The pivot provides more than 50 million Vanguard brokerage customers with access to regulated crypto funds, including those from rival asset manager BlackRock. Nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that launched early last year attracted impressive inflows, pushing their combined assets to nearly $120 billion, while ETH products grew to around $20 billion, per SoSoValue data. Still, Vanguard astutely indicated that it would steer clear of such crypto-related investment products, citing volatility and the speculative nature of assets. As recently as August 2024, iShares veteran and current CEO Salim Ramji had ruled out any plans to offer crypto ETFs. According to Bloomberg, the Wall Street behemoth’s decision to embrace crypto assets is a response to strong demand from retail and institutional clients despite a sharp market pullback. Some crypto commentators believe Vanguard’s change of heart could lead to a deluge of crypto ETF customers and act as a catalyst for crypto prices. Vanguard is second only to BlackRock as an asset manager, with roughly $11 trillion in global assets under management. Crypto strategist Nilesh Rohilla noted on X that he would be shocked if the BTC price doesn’t “jump 5% in this news in the next 24 hrs.” Vivek Sen, the founder of Bitcoin public relations company Bitgrow Lab, also forecasted that there are “trillions incoming.” Meanwhile, X user BankXRP observed: “This is another massive signal that traditional finance is fully stepping into digital assets. The wall of money is lining up.”

Title: Bank of America Backs 4% Crypto Allocation as Retail Takes Losses

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Bank of America (BofA) has officially endorsed a 1%–4% allocation to crypto for its wealth management clients, marking a landmark shift in how Wall Street approaches digital assets. However, the move arrives at a challenging time for retail investors, who now hold the majority of Bitcoin ETF supply and are absorbing significant market losses. Yahoo Finance reported on Tuesday that Bank of America will begin CIO coverage of four Bitcoin ETFs, including BITB, FBTC, Grayscale Mini Trust, and IBIT, starting January 5, 2026. It would enable more than 15,000 advisers across Merrill, the Private Bank, and Merrill Edge to recommend regulated crypto products for the first time proactively. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” said Chris Hyzy, CIO of Bank of America Private Bank. He added that guidance emphasizes “regulated vehicles, thoughtful allocation, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and risks.” Previously, clients could access crypto ETFs only by request, a barrier that left many retail investors searching for exposure elsewhere. The update “reflects growing client demand for access to digital assets,” said Nancy Fahmy, head of BofA’s investment solutions group. BofA’s guidance follows a broader institutional shift: These changes align with a sweeping policy reversal under the Trump administration, which dismantled several constraints imposed by the Biden administration on banks engaging with digital assets. Many firms now await Congressional clarity on custody, direct trading, and broader on-platform crypto services. The timing of Wall Street’s adoption is striking. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 33% from its $126,000 peak, and is down about 10% YTD, even as the S&P 500 climbs 15%. According to Bernstein, retail investors hold approximately 75% of spot Bitcoin ETF assets, making them the most exposed to price volatility. Meanwhile, institutional ownership has increased from 20% to 28%, reflecting a strategic rotation into Bitcoin and Ethereum as retail investors capitulate. The recent wave of altcoin-heavy ETFs has fared even worse: Against this backdrop, concerns linger about how the prospective LINK ETF could fare. “This appears to be a combination of retail traders getting burned and issuers mistiming their entry,” Bloomberg reported, citing Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, warning that ETF wrappers can give smaller investors “a false sense of security.” BofA’s move signals that the institutional era of crypto is accelerating, bringing regulated exposure to millions of mainstream clients. However, with retail still absorbing the sharpest losses and ownership quickly shifting toward ETF-based holders, market volatility may remain elevated. The next catalyst is likely to come from Washington, where pending legislation could determine how deeply banks can integrate cryptocurrency into their core services.

Share this article Bank of America, one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, has advised its wealth management clients to consider allocating 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets through regulated investment vehicles, Yahoo Finance reported on Tuesday. The bank’s investment strategists will begin providing research coverage on four Bitcoin ETFs in January, allowing its 15,000 advisers to formally recommend them. The covered funds include products from Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock. The recommendation is consistent with the ongoing adoption of digital assets within traditional finance. Major financial institutions have increasingly embraced crypto assets as portfolio components. Banks are adjusting their wealth management strategies to include digital assets as potential thematic investments, moving beyond previous skepticism. Bitcoin has gained acceptance among institutional players as a hedge against economic uncertainties. The digital asset is viewed as both a store of value and a medium of exchange within decentralized financial systems. Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee is recommending 2%–4% crypto allocations for suitable clients, calling Bitcoin “digital gold” and viewing crypto as a speculative but maturing asset class. The guidance favors ETF-based exposure with regular rebalancing. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account? Sign In Forgot your password?

Title: Meesho faces investor protest over anchor allotment to SBI Funds

(Bloomberg) -- Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book faced a setback after several major investors pulled out when the Indian e-commerce firm was said to have allocated about a quarter of the shares in this tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., the country’s largest asset manager, according to people familiar with the matter. That decision triggered a pushback from other large funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Meesho is set to open its anchor book — a portion of shares reserved for institutional investors — on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that launches on Wednesday. Among those who withdrew were Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., Nippon India Life Asset Management Ltd. and Nomura Asset Management, the people said. Many had sought allocations on par with those of SBI Funds and opted out in what was viewed as a protest, they added. Even so, Meesho’s anchor lineup features several global investors, including sovereign wealth funds such as GIC Pte and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, alongside major long-only investors like Fidelity International, BlackRock Inc., Baillie Gifford, as well as global firms like WCM Investment Management and Dragoneer Investment Group LLC, the people said. To be sure, the anchor allotment process is still ongoing, and the final investor lineup may change. The episode underscores the intense demand for India’s tech startups as they move toward public listings. Recent IPOs from digital platforms including Urban Co. and Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. — the parent of discount broker Groww — have drawn heavy demand, reflecting consumers’ rapid shift toward online services and commerce. Representatives for Capital Group and Aberdeen declined to comment. Spokespersons at Meesho, SBI Funds and the other investors didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Bengaluru-based marketplace, which links small manufacturers with price-sensitive consumers in smaller Indian cities, aims to raise as much as 54.2 billion rupees ($603 million). The shares are priced in a range of 105 rupees to 111 rupees apiece, according to a newspaper advertisement published Friday. Existing shareholders, including Elevation Capital V Ltd., Peak XV Partners Investments V and Meesho’s founders will sell shares in the offering.

Title: Audio language model startup Gradium raises $70M to create more realistic voice AI systems
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/audio-language-model-startup-gradium-raises-70m-create-realistic-voice-ai-systems/
Time Published: 2025-12-02T12:00:09Z

UPDATED 07:00 EST / DECEMBER 02 2025 by Mike Wheatley Audio artificial intelligence startup Gradium is launching today after closing on an impressive $70 million seed funding round, just three months after it was founded. The startup is backed by investors that include FirstMark Capital and Eurazeo, which led the funding round, as well as DST Global Partners, Korelya Capital and Amplify Partners, and high-profile angels such as former Google LLC Chief Executive Eric Schmidt. Gradium’s mission is to commercialize audio language models, which are specialized AI systems that are designed to process, understand and generate natural language using audio-text data. Natural language is leveraged as a “supervision signal,” allowing ALMs to perform tasks such as audio classification and speech synthesis more effectively than general-purpose large language models. The startup says ALMs are the “audio-native counterpart” to LLMs and are meant to support more natural and expressive voice interactions with dramatically lower latency, making conversations with AI feel more realistic. The concept was first developed by Gradium’s founders during their time at Kyutai, a nonprofit AI research lab. ALMs are trained on datasets that pair audio with descriptive text, enabling them to learn the complex relationships between sound and language. The natural language supervision technique replaces traditional labeling, using natural speech as a guiding signal to teach them how to understand and say specific words. Co-founder and Chief Executive Neil Zeghidour explained that his company wants to help ALMs lock the true potential of “voice AI,” which is still reliant on what he says are subpar systems. “Existing systems are brittle, costly and unable to deliver truly natural interactions,” he said. “Our goal is to make voice the primary interface between humans and machines.” According to Zeghidour, ALMs can outperform LLMs in any kind of voice AI task, including areas such as speech recognition, where spoken language is transformed into written text, as well as audio generation, such as creating original speech, and audio classification, which refers to identifying and categorizing different audio signals. Ultimately, Gradium wants to transform the capabilities of AI assistants and agents, making conversational interactions between them and humans feel more natural and realistic. “To achieve this, we’re eliminating the longstanding tradeoff between quality and scalability: combining ultra-realistic expressivity, accurate transcription and ultra-low-latency interactions at a price point that finally makes high-quality voice ubiquitous,” Zeghidour said. Zeghidour has assembled a talented team to make good on this promise, comprised of researchers and engineers who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, Meta Platforms Inc.’s FAIR research team and Jane Street Capital LLC. He said the company possesses one of the industry’s highest concentrations of generative audio expertise assembled so far, and it has already developed a number of production-ready systems that are being used by early adopters and generating revenue. Those early adopters include companies in gaming, customer care, language learning, healthcare and AI agents. Gradium is launching its platform and enabling access to its first models today, with support for English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. It says it offers flexible plans catering to the smallest developer teams all the way up to the largest enterprises. The startup said it will continue its ongoing collaboration with Kyutai, ensuring it has access to the latest frontier research in generative audio so it can remain at the forefront of the latest innovations in ALMs. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Earlier this year, a slightly balding man in spectacles, a black T-shirt, and bright high-top sneakers gave a presentation about how his computer can predict what you want to buy. His name is Dr. Uri Yerushalmi, co-founder and chief artificial intelligence officer of Fetcherr, an Israeli-based pricing consultant used by a half dozen airlines around the world. “While most of us in the AI community have been focusing on building models that are generating either text or image, in Fetcherr we have been focusing during the last five years on building large market models,” Yerushalmi said. Trained on years of market data—prices, orders, competitors, regulation, stock prices, even the weather—Fetcherr’s “business agents” aim to simulate market dynamics, assist pricing analysts, and even automatically price tickets. More from David Dayen One presentation slide stuck out. It showed price fluctuations before the use of Fetcherr’s system and after. In the before graph, prices are relatively static and straight. After Fetcherr, the jagged lines pulse with staccato rhythms. “The dynamic is much more similar to dynamics in NASDAQ or capital markets where the prices change much more frequently,” said Yerushalmi, “because every time something in the market changes, there is an immediate response.” Yerushalmi once ran AI for a high-speed stock trading firm. He approaches pricing like a science experiment, engaging in constant real-time testing and tweaking to maximize corporate profits. Fetcherr boasts of delivering annual “revenue uplift” of over 10 percent. The guinea pigs for these tests, the ones being separated from their cash, are you and me. AI can depict you as an anime character. It can respond half-intelligently to questions about the Franco-Prussian War or concentrations of sulfur in the upper atmosphere. It can delight and distract and maybe help you get work done. But none of that is as prized by corporate America as its data-driven approach to the previously conjectural world of pricing. Supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. “That’s the use case they don’t want you to talk about. That’s why we’re building all these data centers,” said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project. “As we have built social media platforms that shape the flow of information across society, now we are building the platforms that control the flow of money.” Technology-fueled pricing is more widespread than once thought, presenting serious policy challenges in an age where affordability is on everyone’s minds. AI bots are colluding with one another, anticipating consumer choices, and accumulating surplus—that is, transferring wealth—for the businesses that employ them. It’s part of why corporate profits hit record highs after the pandemic and have stayed there. The public recoils at the thought of seeing prices tick up based on when they like to get lunch or what device they’re using. When Delta, which employs Fetcherr as a pricing agent, announced on an earnings call this summer that up to 20 percent of its flights would be priced using AI by the end of the year, the outcry was so intense that the company claimed its critics were peddling “misinformation.” Policymakers and advocates have united to crack down on some tactics, winning real legislative victories from coast to coast. But every step government takes can be countered by AI price-setters. How can consumers keep up? “What worries me is that it will become hyperefficient to price discriminate and to charge more in ways that ordinary people will not be able to combat,” said Doha Mekki, the top deputy at the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division under Joe Biden. “And it will make a very bad cost-of-living crisis even worse.” A YEAR AGO, I WROTE ABOUT WHAT I TERMED surveillance pricing: companies offering individualized prices based on personal data. The idea was that a business equipped with granular information about demographics, purchase history, social and financial interactions, or even medical status could exploit a customer’s willingness to pay. Uber could charge more when a rider booked on a company credit card; people aren’t as price-sensitive when someone else is paying. Delta could jack up fares after learning that a traveler needs to attend a funeral; desperation could translate into opportunity. I couldn’t be certain how many businesses used surveillance pricing. The proliferation of third-party pricing consultants touting “digital pricing transformations” seemed like a strong indicator. But concealment was key to the strategy, to minimize the anger generated by charging different prices to different people. For instance, when a reporter at SFGate logged in to hotel booking platforms using his regular IP address in high-wage San Francisco, he received a quote of $829 a night. But when he used a virtual private network set up to originate from Phoenix or Kansas City, prices were more than $500 less. Without a public price, it takes research to understand if someone is being ripped off. A month after my report, Lina Khan’s Federal Trade Commission announced an investigation into surveillance pricing, seeking information from eight third-party consultants. The agency only had a short time to conduct the study before the changeover of power in Washington. But days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, it issued “research summaries” of the work done thus far. (Trump’s FTC has yet to finish the study.) Stephanie Nguyen, the FTC’s chief technologist under Khan, told me those eight pricing consultants were working with over 250 clients, suggesting broad reach across the economy. Services included individually targeted pricing, segmentation of customers based on their profiles, and ranking tools that alter what products people see atop a web page or search. A customer clicking on fast shipping, for example, suggests an urgency that would lead them to tolerate higher prices. The key to surveillance pricing is data. Nguyen and Sam Levine, the FTC’s former head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, recently wrote a paper about how customers deliver that data when they sign up for loyalty programs. Enticed by promised discounts and concierge treatment, customers consent to data collection that allows companies to build intricate social graphs; one customer profile created by the grocery chain Kroger stretched to 62 pages. The discounts often aren’t maintained or are curtailed, loyalty card fees expand over time, and the more loyal a customer, the more data is collected and the more they pay over time, according to the report. One case study is the McDonald’s app, which has 185 million users and provides seamless access on smartphones, our personal data-spewing machines. According to a recent earnings call, after downloading the app, a customer goes from 10.5 annual McDonald’s visits on average to 26. McDonald’s clearly wants its customers on the app. Its popular Monopoly game gives out stickers on the packaging of items like Big Macs and fries; you collect the right ones to win big prizes. But this year, instead of filling out a physical game board, Monopoly pieces now must be scanned into the app. “This is about taxing people who don’t turn over their data, and manipulating people who do,” Levine said. “Do we really want a world in which you will have to pay a premium if you want to shop anonymously?” Surveillance pricing is just one technology that companies use to set prices. Surge pricing accelerates supply and demand to raise prices when more people want the product or service. Subscription pricing offers products for a monthly fee, a steady stream of revenue from absent-minded customers that can feature deceptive sign-ups and impossible cancellation policies. Trump’s FTC sued Uber for a subscription service that takes as many as 23 screens and 32 actions to cancel; Amazon Prime’s cancellation policy, the subject of a separate FTC settlement that cost the company $2.5 billion, was internally nicknamed “Iliad Flow,” like the tortuous war Odysseus waged in the Greek epic. Electronic shelf tags at Walmart and other grocers have triggered fears of endlessly changing prices while you shop. FIFA has confirmed use of differential pricing for World Cup events based on demand, something New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has criticized. “They can become a tool for pure extraction and leave everybody paying what they shouldn’t,” said Kevin Erickson of the Future of Music Coalition, which monitors event ticketing. One of the most insidious uses of technology is on the wage side. An issue brief from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth focused on how companies are using personal data to set worker pay, something first seen in the ride-hailing industry. Twenty AI consultants offer surveillance wage services to clients in logistics, manufacturing, retail, finance, education, transportation, technology, and health care, which is “the new Uber in a lot of ways,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California and co-author of the report. The AI systems can adjust worker pay in real time, and offer different wages to people doing the same work. They can adjust wages based on performance data, customer feedback, and even factors off the job, such as “predictive analytics that attempt to determine a worker’s potential tolerance for low pay,” the report notes. Most of these wage-setting practices are opaque to workers or their bargaining representatives. “This is becoming normalized,” Dubal said. “It fundamentally undermines the well-worn and very American idea that hard work should result in higher pay.” The result of these strategies is that supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. AI-based pricing has become more critical than sale volume or product quality. Customers seeking a fair deal are simply outworked, unable to avoid being targeted. “There used to be moments where you really blew it, you had to buy a last-minute airline ticket and they’ve got you,” said Tim Wu, former competition policy chief in the Biden White House. “That’s really daily life now.” Consumers used to benefit from what economists would call imperfect information. The uncertainty of defining the optimal price, and the ability in open markets for new businesses to undercut competitors, gave consumers a fighting chance to get a deal, or just to manage their life without being tracked and prodded. Technology eliminates that information inefficiency. “What these technologies are about is eliminating all risk for the shareholder,” Hepner said. “There’s no more error. It is a well-oiled extraction machine.” EVEN ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN SURPRISED by the furiousness of the response to technology-aided pricing. As post-pandemic inflation swelled, AI trickery was a tangible, easy-to-understand depiction of an economy rigged against ordinary people, and the lack of transparency and unpredictability vexed consumers. “It was hiding in plain sight and everyone has found it and you just can’t unsee it,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative. Politicians looking for anti-inflation messaging rode the wave of constituent anger. Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) challenged Delta’s palpable glee over surveillance pricing in an earnings call, and when Delta responded that they wouldn’t actually target customers using their personal data, Gallego didn’t let up. After all, Delta’s president Glen Hauenstein said on the earnings call that “to get [travelers] the right offer in your hand at the right time” is the “Holy Grail,” which sure sounds like surveillance pricing. “Delta is telling their investors one thing, and then turning around and telling the public another,” Gallego said in a statement. House Democrats proposed a bill to ban surveillance pricing and surveillance wage-setting. So-called “drip pricing,” where junk fees are added during a sale, was effectively banned in event ticketing and hotel stays by an FTC rule finalized in May. But with GOP control of Washington, the real action has moved to the states. Surveillance pricing bans were introduced in California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota; surge pricing bans for grocery stores and restaurants were introduced in New York and Maine. By July, 24 states had seen bills introduced over some form of technology-aided pricing, according to a tracker from Consumer Reports. In a major win this year, the nation’s two largest blue states explicitly banned algorithmic price-fixing, a tactic famously used by RealPage, which aggregated data from landlords across a city and recommended coordinated rent hikes. Joe Biden’s Justice Department sued RealPage, reaching settlements with corporate landlords vowing to end the practice. But data aggregators like Agri Stats and PotatoTrac already do this for meat and produce, and states wanted to prevent tech-enabled collusion from expanding. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Advocates were pushing on an open door; housing is the biggest monthly expense people have. “When RealPage came out, it quickly mapped onto something people feel viscerally,” said Samantha Gordon, chief advocacy officer at TechEquity, which lobbied on the California tech pricing bills. Moreover, since price-fixing is illegal when human beings enter a smoke-filled room and collude, extending that to algorithmic collusion made sense to lawmakers. That was the concept behind California’s AB 325, which states that “common pricing algorithms,” whether informed through public or nonpublic competitor data, violate the Cartwright Act, California’s antitrust law. The law lowers the evidence standard to prove an algorithmic pricing conspiracy. It also prohibits anyone from distributing a pricing tool that coerces the setting of a recommended price, protecting small businesses along with consumers, explained Hepner, who was active in drafting the bill. “We saw mom-and-pop businesses swept up into these pricing schemes,” he said. “If you want to get the buy box on Amazon, you have to use their smart pricing tool. You have to give up independent decision-making authority to participate in the economy.” After seven rounds of amendments, AB 325 passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed it in October. Days later, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) signed S.7882, another prohibition on coordinated price-fixing via software, though limited to rental housing. The New York law also blocks landlords from using algorithms to set “lease renewal terms, ideal occupancy levels, or other lease terms and conditions.” Cities like Jersey City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Seattle have enacted similar citywide collusion bans, and 51 algorithmic price-fixing bills were introduced nationwide in just the 2025 legislative session. It’s “a potentially very powerful first step in tilting some of this economy back in favor of consumers,” Hepner said. The best way to get at surveillance pricing might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. Surveillance pricing bills have not seen the same success, though their failure revealed critical information. In California, AB 446, which would have banned pricing based on personal data, was held back, giving sponsors time to build support next year. That’s because businesses across the economy, even ones not suspected of surveillance pricing, swarmed Sacramento to defend their practices. “It was fascinating over the course of that legislative process to see the opposition come out and openly say, ‘Hey, we’re actually doing this, you mean we can’t do this anymore?’” Hepner told me. Some economists allege that tech pricing crackdowns threaten discounts and other potential benefits for consumers. But it’s hard to believe that companies would hire the most sophisticated engineers to figure out how to reduce their revenues. As Nguyen told me, the argument to preserve discounts boils down to this: “You can have privacy or low prices, but you can’t have both.” A modest breakthrough came in New York, which passed a disclosure law requiring that relevant transactions include a pop-up stating: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” The National Retail Federation sued to block the law, but in October, a federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that the disclaimer “is plainly factual.” Advocates believe that the legal victory will give policymakers permission to revisit the topic. But the fierce pushback showed that AI-based pricing was no longer a speculative harm. “So many companies and industries trying to kill [surveillance pricing bans] told us everything we need to know on why everything is getting more and more expensive,” Gordon concluded. RealPage got the message as well. As the price-fixing bills worked their way through statehouses, the company announced it was acquiring Livble, a property management software tool. With Livble integrated into their platform, RealPage said, residents could subdivide rental payments into installments based on real-time cash flow landlords can see. In other words, RealPage was trying out surveillance pricing. THESE TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFTS FROM ONE SCHEME to the next make it difficult for policymakers to stay ahead of the curve. For example, Lyft, one of the early adopters of surge pricing, reacted to rider anger about the service being more expensive precisely when they needed it most by moving to something called Price Lock, a subscription-based pricing tool that caps fares on targeted routes—for a monthly fee. Another tactic involves redefining basic terms. When Delta claimed it would not use personal data, it added that it was merely “enhanc[ing] our existing fare pricing processes” with AI. “The lack of regulations about this and the way people’s data can be collected and used allows them to play around with what they are calling personal data and use,” said Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. This forces policymakers to think more broadly, even on the outer edges of the possible. “I do worry that we’re always going to be chasing the companies,” said Sam Levine. “I think companies need to advertise a price publicly that’s available to all consumers … there should be a basic principle to advertise a price and it’s deceptive to charge more than that.” Levine’s testimony to Congress this summer hits on another option: limiting collection of personal data, rather than just its usage. “‘Surveillance pricing’ is only possible because of how companies collect, share, and weaponize our personal data,” he told lawmakers, while arguing that relying on outdated tools to safeguard privacy risked further abuse. Consumer protection and anti-monopoly experts are warming to this idea of cutting the data off at the source. Companies, after all, provide a full road map of what they collect in the privacy policies almost nobody reads. Levine and Nguyen’s loyalty program paper documents privacy policies, finding that rental car giant Hertz admits to collecting demographic and behavioral data, Home Depot tracks Wi-Fi usage inside their stores, and Macy’s captures customer driver’s licenses. Much of this data is sold to third-party data brokers, who share it with other businesses. A data minimization standard could prevent use of personal information for pricing, Winters suggested. Mekki added that antitrust law recognizes that antitrust remedies often call for disgorgement of whatever gives companies an unfair advantage in the marketplace. Applied to surveillance pricing, that would argue for destroying the data allowing them to price-set. “If you can be forced to give up money or property, it stands to reason that you need to give up data,” she said. The bipartisan American Privacy Rights Act introduced last year would have limited collection of certain kinds of data and given people the ability to opt out of having their data used to target them or sold to third parties. But this is at least the third major comprehensive privacy bill in the internet era that’s gone nowhere in Congress; too many companies are invested in the surveillance economy to let it be legislated out of existence. “This is a textbook example of people not getting what they want,” said Wu, whose recent book The Age of Extraction highlights Big Tech platform-ization multiplying across the economy. “Is there anyone in America who wants less privacy or thinks it’s fine, or really wants targeted ads? The constituency is zero … In 20 years of privacy laws, there hasn’t been a single vote. This is not even a conspiracy. The tech industry lobbyists specialize in one thing: killing privacy laws.” Some states have fared better, with a dozen passing limitations on data collection or letting consumers opt out of targeted ads or sale of personal data. California updated its policy this legislative session by passing AB 566, which allows internet users to opt out of data collection at the browser level, rather than having to go website by website. But practically all privacy legislation has carve-outs for “bona fide loyalty programs,” giving companies an escape hatch under the guise of offering discounts. Even given that, however, loyalty programs are not exempt from “excessive” collection under these statutes that is not reasonably necessary. Maryland recently finalized a privacy law that prevents companies from conditioning loyalty programs on the sale of data, despite industry pushback. The best way to get at this activity might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. That includes companies acting as data brokers by selling and trading data, and the third-party pricing consultants they share the data with. Data sales could be considered unfair or deceptive under state consumer protection laws. And even when customers consent to having their data collected, they may not be consenting to transferring that data to third parties. “State enforcers should be thinking, under what circumstances is it lawful for companies to share personal data with pricing consultants?” Levine said. Under Lina Khan, the FTC made headway by looking at these agglomerations of data as unfair practices, and subsequently prohibiting the sale of sensitive data, like when someone visits an abortion clinic. Today’s FTC has walked away from this enforcement, but their past work outlines a path for states to argue that targeted pricing is similarly unfair. AI PRICING WON’T LOOK THE SAME IN FIVE YEARS as it does now, but we have hints of where it’s going. That’s why the role of Fetcherr is more interesting than Delta’s meandering explanations for how it uses AI. Airlines have been at the forefront of every pricing innovation of the past 30 years, from junk fees to differential pricing to loyalty programs. What’s the next frontier? Fetcherr, which closed $90 million in funding in 2024 and another $42 million this year, tells you right on its website: “hyper-personalization at scale.” (Or at least, it used to tell you that, before it scrubbed this section.) “We’re talking about understanding each customer as an individual, optimizing every interaction for maximum value,” the now-redacted section states, detailing how its AI model uses data points like “customer lifetime value, past purchase behaviors, and the real-time context of each booking inquiry” to give each passenger their own product bundle at a bespoke price. The goal isn’t just a pleasant customer experience—it’s “revenue growth.” Robby Nissan, a Fetcherr co-founder, has said publicly that its AI systems can “manipulat[e] the market in order to gain more profit.” There’s not a lot of mystery here. There are other airline pricing consultants, like Peter Thiel–backed FLYR and PROS and Air Price IQ. But the pitch is the same: maximizing travelers’ willingness to pay by analyzing reams of data. If you want to see the dystopia of perfect information accurately predicting exactly how much you’ll pay for a service, just book a flight this Christmas. “It’s a very real example of how AI-based pricing schemes put consumers into economic silos,” Hepner said. “You cannot comparison shop anymore. You cannot predict what a price is supposed to be anymore.” This is facilitated by a concentrated economy where markets aren’t as open to alternatives to AI-optimized schemes. But AI pricing may shrink choice even further. For example, Delta recently stopped flying from LAX to London Heathrow Airport, despite the popularity of the route. Virgin Atlantic still makes the LAX-Heathrow trip; it’s a joint venture partner with Delta, and perhaps as important, both of them use Fetcherr. Was canceling the route an AI-enabled suggestion to benefit another client? We will never know. Large market models running millions of price tests with thousands of input signals could short-circuit restrictions on surveillance pricing or data minimization. If it’s all just simulations, after all, is it really using personal data? Another future is glimpsed in the rise of AI agents that shop for you. ChatGPT users will soon be able to link their PayPal accounts for instant purchases based on chatbot recommendations. Walmart has partnered with OpenAI for e-commerce as well. Autonomous bots with a linked bank account could even shop on their own, something a new AI agent lobby is trying to facilitate in Washington. There’s little transparency on how products are recommended, how prices are derived, or whether AI agents will act in the interest of consumers or the retailers they’re partnering with. “You’re delegating purchasing power to one algorithm to interface with another,” said Ben Winters. “You’re getting people signed up into these systems where they have no control.” But there’s also a brighter future possible, one where the backlash to nonstop data collection and pricing subterfuge accelerates, and people simply demand a fair price. Polling shows that the public is deeply skeptical that AI will work in their favor. Consumers may not have much control, but they do hold the dollars companies need to thrive, and they can withhold them from companies that treat them poorly. “I think it’s possible that this is headed back to cost-based pricing,” said Owens, whose book Gouged about the new era of pricing releases next year. “It’s the way companies priced for decades … There is a world where the outcome is transparent, public, predictable pricing.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: The New Bubble: How AI and Passive Investing Have Turned the Market into a Powder Keg

The US equity market is a bubble. Here is why: In my mind, to be defined as a “bubble” the potential for a sudden “pop” needs to be there. No matter how you define it, the probability of an extremely large drawdown in the S&P 500 has exponentially increased in the past few years. This doesn’t mean it is a high probability — it just means the tail has gotten much fatter. The main reason for this is index concentration is now being coupled with earnings concentration. Firstly, passive investing has clearly contributed to the top market caps consistently outperforming over the past decade. Passive is inherently pro-momentum. As these stocks were rewarded, it became easier for the companies to use their balance sheet for buying up competitors, seeking top talent, cheap access to debt so they could buy back more shares, etc. It has been a snowball of positive forces for the big tech space in the past 15 years and FLOWS have been a big part of it. However, what has notably changed in the past few years is that their actual earnings have become much more correlated. Yes, Google and Meta at the end of the day are ad companies. Those ads are seen on the screen of an iPhone. They feed Amazon orders. And all of that runs on the cloud behind the scenes. So in a way they have always had very correlated earnings growth, but now they are intertwining even more. Headlines from the past 12 months to give a taste: The Mag 7’s earnings as a percentage of the overall index has surged higher. That is because they are feeding each other’s growth now. Their balance sheets are becoming more and more intertwined while their market caps have become fueled by similar hopes. The point here is this: passive investing led to an increase in correlation of these stocks and contributed to their outperformance. But now, AI has led to a further increase in correlation at the fundamental level. To me, this is now what defines this market as a bubble. It is not about all-time high valuations. It is the fact that the stocks are all being pushed higher by similar forces (passive flows and buybacks) while at the fundamental level they are becoming more intertwined by the OBVIOUSLY permeable, flammable, and house-of-cards AI euphoria. Speaking of nuts… We have just had 27 leveraged 3x and 5x single stock ETFs filed by Volatility Shares. 3x AMD ETF 3x AMZN ETF 3x COIN ETF 3x CRCL ETF 3x GOOGL ETF 3x MSTR ETF 3x NVDA ETF 3x PLTR ETF 3x TSLA ETF 3x Bitcoin ETF 3x Ether ETF 3x Solana ETF 3x XRP ETF 3x VIX ETF 5x AMD ETF 5x AMZN ETF 5x COIN ETF 5x CRCL ETF 5x GOOGL ETF 5x MSTR ETF 5x NVDA ETF 5x PLTR ETF 5x TSLA ETF 5x Bitcoin ETF 5x Ether ETF 5x Solana ETF 5x XRP ETF From a broader perspective… These “5x bullish” ETFs are scheduled to be listed towards the end of the year. We believe this may accurately coincide with a top in the market. Great caution is now warranted… if you’ve been with us for some time you will know that we shy away from bombastic sensationalist type of commentary and so we do not say this lightly. This is the most apprehensive we have been since the GFC for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 at least!

A major vaccine producer came under pressure following a report federal health regulators plan to tighten vaccine approval rules. Meanwhile, an agreement with the world's most valuable company bolstered a software firm whose products help customers design and test semiconductors. Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground to start December after a strong week to end November. The Nasdaq slipped 0.4%, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and the Dow dropped 0.9%. See here for more from Investopedia on the day's market moves. Shares of Moderna (MRNA), which makes the bulk of its revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine, tumbled 7% to lead losses on the S&P 500 after a report the Food and Drug Administration plans to overhaul its process for evaluating vaccines, requiring more evidence of safety and efficacy prior to approval. Novavax (NVAX), BioNTech (BNTX), and Pfizer (PFE) also slid. Shares of Sandisk (SNDK), a maker of memory cards and other data storage products, dropped close to 6%. With the move lower Monday, Sandisk reversed gains last week on enthusiasm for the stock's S&P 500 debut. Despite the decline to start December, Sandisk shares have still notched big gains since the company completed its spinoff from Western Digital (WDC) in February, bolstered by AI-driven memory demand. Despite showing signs of a possible recovery last week, the price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and other major cryptocurrencies plunged Monday. Shares of crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global (COIN) fell about 5%, while shares Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers access to crypto on its trading platform, lost 4%. Synopsys (SNPS) was the best-performing stock in the benchmark index Monday as shares jumped around 5% after the provider of electronic design automation software announced an expanded partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). Under the terms of the deal, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Synopsys, and the two companies will collaborate on agentic and physical AI applications. Nvidia stock added 1.7%. Shares of footwear and apparel company Deckers Outdoor (DECK) rose 4.5%. Late last month, analysts at Stifel upgraded Deckers stock to "buy" from "hold," pointing to an upbeat growth outlook for the company's Hoka shoe brand, solid demand for the Ugg brand, and a strong international sales. The company offered rare discounts on Hoka sneakers for Black Friday. A pair of transport and logistics companies also got a boost following bullish comments from analysts at BMO Capital. Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) shares each added over 3% after BMO analysts issued "outperform" ratings for the stocks.

Title: Here's why everyone's talking about a 'K-shaped' economy
URL: https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/01/k-shaped-economy/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T21:00:04Z

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

Title: Here’s why everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%.

Title: Wall Street Continues to Underestimate the Growth of Magnificent Seven Companies. Here's Why.
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/wall-street-continues-to-underestimate-the-growth-of-magnificent-seven-companies-here-is-why-11857190
Time Published: 2025-12-01T20:38:59Z
Full Content:
At first glance, the Magnificent Seven had a bit of a stinker of a third quarter. But dig deeper, and there’s reason to believe Wall Street is underestimating tech's heavy hitters. The Mag 7—Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—reported third quarter earnings growth of 18.4%, the group’s slowest growth rate since the first quarter of 2023, according to FactSet Research analyst John Butters. But that figure comes with a big caveat: Meta’s profit plummeted from the previous year after it booked a $16 billion tax charge. Exclude that one-time expense, and profits actually grew 30%. Not only is that twice as fast as Wall Street was expecting heading into earnings season, it’s also faster than the prior quarter when earnings were up 26%. “The third quarter saw a slight acceleration in Mag Seven earnings growth, suggesting to us that estimates over the next couple of quarters could be too low,” wrote LPL Financial analysts in a recent note. The Magnificent Seven has been the main driver of S&P 500 earnings growth for several years. Wall Street has been predicting a slowdown for more than a year, but the tech giant's have repeatedly topped expectations. Wall Street has been predicting a slowdown in Mag 7 growth for more than a year, but the group keeps blowing past expectations, thanks in large part to artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet all signaled that they expect to continue aggressively investing in AI infrastructure next year. LPL’s analysts expect those investments to support corporate profits “because—assuming they happen—they are revenue for someone.” The primary “someone” is Nvidia, which dominates the AI chip market and last month topped estimates with its sales, profit, and earnings outlook. AI spending has been more of a liability than an asset for the Mag 7 recently. Investors are concerned that tech giants are overspending—or, at best, inefficiently spending—on a nascent technology that they may struggle to monetize for some time. To many on Wall Street, the AI buildout is looking more and more like the Dotcom Bubble of the 1990s. “Given these hyperscalers are spending around 25% of revenue on capex, and their capex is draining free cash flows, Wall Street may demand more proof of return on investment going forward,” wrote LPL’s analysts. Wall Street is also recalibrating its expectations. As of late November, analysts predict the Mag 7's earnings growth will average 21% over the next four quarters, up from just 15% at the end of August. Among Mag 7 stocks, only Alphabet and Nvidia, which have gained 66% and 33%, respectively, since the start of the year as of Monday afternoon, have risen more than the S&P 500's 16% year-to-date increase.

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground Monday afternoon, as shares of tech and cryptocurrency-related companies pulled back. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq slid about 0.2%, while the Dow dropped 0.4%. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) was one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, with shares down about 6% as the price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies fell. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD) dropped close to 5%. Shares of vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA) slumped 6% following reports an official with the the Food and Drug Administration called for a stricter vaccine approval process. Sandisk (SNDK) shares plunged close to 7%, reversing last week's gains on enthusiasm for its addition to the S&P 500. Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) climbed about 6% and 4% respectively, following bullish comments from BMO Capital. The bank gave both stocks an “outperform” rating, pointing to Old Dominion benefiting from its less-than-truckload focus and J.B. Hunt’s cost savings and intermodal volumes, among other things. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) shares gained around 4% as Goldman Sachs put the casino operator on its conviction buy list. Goldman said Wynn has a best-in-class business in Las Vegas, and should benefit from improvements in Macao. Shares of Synopsys (SNPS) climbed 4% after chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) said it's investing $2 billion in the maker of semiconductor and circuit design software as part of a partnership. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.09%. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen.

Title: Americans spending more for the holidays despite dour economic views

Watch CBS News Updated on: December 1, 2025 / 3:43 PM EST / CBS News Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts. Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago. The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market. Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said. "A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less," Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. "So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth." He added, "This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did." Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April. Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few "big ticket" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck. Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers. Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays. Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. Spending among the bottom 80% of households — or those earning less than $175,000 a year — has "simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic," Zandi wrote in a September social media post. That's creating a so-called K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs. "Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer," Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. "Widening behavioral gap — high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious." For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted. "So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well," he said. "Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too."

Investing Analysts at Guggenheim says Alphabet could run even higher. The firm raised its price target on GOOG to $375 from $330 with a buy rating. Analysts at Goldman Sachs just added Wynn to its conviction buy list. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com December is historically strong for markets. In fact, “December could bring seasonal tailwinds back to the stock market and return it to all-time highs. Historically, since 1950, it’s the third-best month of the year for the Dow and S&P 500; it’s also the third-best month for the Nasdaq, since 1971, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac,” as noted by CNBC. In addition, rate cuts are still on the table, especially after weaker-than-expected private sector jobs growth, retail sales, and consumer confidence. Plus, we strongly believe the worst of the volatility for 2025 is now behind us, as investors start to look ahead to 2026 and start to price in continued earnings growth and artificial intelligence excitement. Even better, analysts still like what they’re seeing in the markets, upgrading: Analysts at Morgan Stanley just reiterated an overweight rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), with a $250 price target. The firm says NVDA will maintain a dominant market share and that threats are becoming overstated. “We continue to see NVIDIA maintaining dominant market share, as threats are becoming overstated, though we aren’t sure exactly what will turn sentiment around,” they said, as quoted by CNBC. “Customers’ biggest anxiety for the next 12 months is their ability to procure enough NVIDIA product generally, and Vera Rubin specifically.” Analysts at Guggenheim say Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) could run even higher. The firm raised its price target on GOOG to $375 from $330 with a buy rating. The firm is confident in Alphabet because of strong cloud backlog growth, which is being supported by enterprise AI demand. It’s also confidence with Google Gemini’s rise as a leading AI platform with rapidly growing adoption metrics, as noted by CNBC. Analysts at Goldman Sachs just added Wynn to its conviction buy list. The firm is confident with Wynn’s (NASDAQ: WYNN) “Wynn Al Marjan in the UAE in 1Q27, plus WYNN’s best-in-class Las Vegas assets, leverage to a higher-income consumers, a strong 2026 Las Vegas event calendar, and an improving backdrop in Macau should drive transformative upside at WYNN,” as quoted by CNBC.

Title: Worst CEOs of the Year: Brian Cornell of Target

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Alex Wong / Getty Images News via Getty Images This is the next in our series on the worst CEOs in America. There will be an all-time winner later in the year. These chief executives were picked based on their major strategy stumbles, as well as how decisions they made affected shareholders, customers, and employees. Some of these CEOs are fairly new to the public corporations they run. Others have had their jobs for years. It is a good thing for investors that they will not have Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) CEO Brian Cornell to kick around anymore. He has taken the retailer through a ruinous period. He took the job in 2014. The Target board showed remarkably bad judgment and kept Cornell on as executive board chair. In a second shocking development, the board made Michael Fiddelke, current chief operating officer, the new CEO as of February 1, 2026. As Cornell ruined Target, Fiddelke helped him. When the board announced the decision, Neil Saunders of GlobalData commented, “The biggest mistake is actually keeping Brian Cornell on the board and making him the chair. It’s just ludicrous. You’re rewarding failure, and everybody at Target knows that.” jeepersmedia / Flickr Target’s stock performance has been horrible. Over the past five years, it is down 49% while the market is up 88%. In the past year, it is down 30% as the market has risen 15%. Year to date, the figures are about the same. By way of comparison, Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is up 118% in the past five years and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) 135% higher. Target has been dogged quarter after quarter by bad earnings. In the most recently reported quarter, net sales fell 1.5% to $25.3 billion. Earnings decreased 18.2% to $1.52 per share. For the first three quarters of the year, the figures were just as poor. Revenue fell 1.7% to $74.3 billion, and earnings dropped 9.6% to $5.85 per share. According to Yahoo Finance, of 38 analysts who follow Target, 28 rate it as Sell or Hold. Their average price target is $96.52, barely up from the current price of $90.62. As Morningstar pointed out, “Though the 2026 leadership transition from CEO Brian Cornell (after 11 years at the helm) to COO Michael Fiddelke (a 20-year veteran of the business) could incite change, we’re skeptical it will be meaningful enough to regain lost market share or materially shift Target’s competitive standing given his long tenure at the retailer.” It may be that the largest single insult to Target shareholders is that Cornell made $20,407,603 in 2024. The insult to employees is that he made 753 times their median compensation. During the period when Cornell was CEO, everyone lost but him.

Title: The K-shaped economy means inflation hurts at the bottom and swells the assets at the top
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/01/what-is-k-shaped-economy-inequality-inflation-rich-poor/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T14:28:15Z
Full Content:
From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. ___ AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. ___ AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

Title: How to handle ‘nepo babies’ in this economic climate

Time Published: 2025-12-01T13:49:00Z
Full Content:
Good morning! It’s no secret that the job market for Gen Z isn’t great—and many young people rely on their parents for help, ranging from financial support to health insurance to job leads. One 2024 study found that more than half of Gen Z asked their parents to find them job opportunities, with 53% of that group reporting that their parents had found them jobs to apply to through personal connections. Julia Lamm, PwC’s principal of workforce solutions, told me she suspects more parents will be trying to pull strings for their adult kids in this economic climate. But how should workplaces deal with “nepo babies”? Lamm had a few suggestions to make sure the hiring process is still fair, and those without connections aren’t shut out. “The really good companies will completely blind [the connection] from the decision-making process so you don’t even know it’s a referral,” she said. “You try to hide that so that it’s inherently an unbiased process.” If that proves impossible—as is often the case when the referred person is related to an owner, founder, or executive at a company—Lamm suggests thinking about a revamp of how entry-level employees engage with the company. One firm she works with is considering a rotational program for junior employees to get hands-on experience with different parts of the company. “It’s to truly support the development of the nepo babies so that if they do rise to a role in the organization that’s going to be a leadership role, they will be credible,” she said. “They will have the experience, and they will be able to properly steer the organization so that the ‘nepo’ part was just opening the door, and they do the rest.” Nepo friends should be treated in a similar fashion. In addition to blind hiring processes, Lamm recommends making sure those employees that were hired by friends in leadership roles be subject to secondary, unbiased reviewers during performance review season. “Sometimes what happens is you … bring your friend on over, and because they were successful in another organization, you think they’re going to be successful here,” Lamm said. “That is not always the case. Those are the scenarios where I’ve seen it go south.” Kristin StollerEditorial Director, Fortune Live Mediakristin.stoller@fortune.com A round-up of the most important HR headlines.

December 01, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: MiningNewsWire MiningNewsWire This article has been disseminated on behalf of MAX Power Mining Corp. and may include a paid advertisement. AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MiningNewsWire Editorial Coverage: Global electricity demand is entering a historic inflection point. The International Energy Agency (IEA) now forecasts that worldwide data center electricity consumption will nearly double by 2030, with AI-driven centers multiplying their energy use more than four-fold over the same period, a pace that strains already overloaded grids across the United States, China, Europe, Southeast Asia and elsewhere. The constraint is no longer bandwidth or chip capability — it is electricity itself. Amid this tightening energy landscape, a compelling new frontier is emerging natural hydrogen, a geologic form of hydrogen being generated continuously within the Earth’s subsurface. Unlike manufactured hydrogen, geologic hydrogen can be produced without electrolysis and emits only water when used for energy production. It may represent the first scalable, low-carbon baseload power source for AI-era demand. That is why MAX Power Mining Corp. (OTC: MAXXF) (CSE: MAXX) (profile) has become the first publicly traded company in North America to advance a massive land package (1.3 million acres) permitted specifically for natural hydrogen exploration and development, including a commercial-scale natural hydrogen well, positioning itself at the forefront of a new energy class. MAX Power is working to establish itself as a leader among well-known companies that are innovating and leading in the AI space, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG).Disclosure: This does not represent material news, partnerships, or investment advice. Click here to view the custom infographic of the MAX Power Mining Corp. editorial. The Global Energy Crunch Meets a New ResourceArtificial intelligence is expanding at a pace that far exceeds the design capacity of existing electricity systems. In addition to IEA’s forecast, Bloomberg projections suggest that U.S. data centers alone could consume as much as 9% of all American electricity by 2035, a dramatic increase that underscores the shifting energy footprint of digital infrastructure. The IEA also reports that per-capita U.S. data-center usage could reach 1,200 kilowatt-hours per year, greatly surpassing consumption levels in most other countries and highlighting the intense energy requirements of emerging technologies. Hydrogen is often highlighted as a key decarbonization tool, yet nearly 99% of global hydrogen production comes from fossil fuels, resulting in significant emissions and high costs. Green hydrogen, while cleaner, requires large amounts of renewable electricity and is expensive to scale. This widening mismatch between electricity supply and clean-energy demand is prompting rapid scientific and commercial interest in geologic hydrogen. Unlike manufactured hydrogen, natural hydrogen arises from water–rock interactions, tectonic processes, and mineral reactions occurring deep underground. The U.S. Geological Survey and other research groups have noted that naturally occurring hydrogen may be far more abundant than previously understood, describing natural hydrogen as a possible near-limitless clean fuel generated by Earth itself. Investors are also taking notice. CNBC reports that Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have backed Koloma, one of the leading natural hydrogen exploration companies, calling the emerging field a gold hydrogen rush. Natural hydrogen offers logistical advantages as well. If sourced near industrial corridors or AI compute clusters, it can serve as a continuous, on-site baseload power source. This would reduce the need for extensive transmission infrastructure and enable operators to place computing power directly above their energy source. For the first time, a clean and potentially low-cost resource may be emerging that aligns with the unprecedented demands of modern computing and electrification. MAX Power Delivers a Historic Milestone As scientific interest grows, MAX Power has made a landmark contribution by delivering the most extensive subsurface indications of natural hydrogen ever recorded in Canada, and potentially the first large-scale commercial discovery globally. This achievement marks a significant step forward for natural hydrogen development globally and positions North America as the breakout leader for hydrogen-focused geological study. MAX Power controls approximately 1.3 million acres of permitted land in Saskatchewan. The region has been studied for its subsurface gas potential, including helium and hydrogen precursors that form in geological systems known to generate natural hydrogen. Through these holdings, the company has successfully drilled North America’s first commercial-scale well dedicated to evaluating natural hydrogen at depth. Saskatchewan’s geological environment, with its mix of sedimentary basins, fault systems, and reactive rock formations, provides a strong basis for exploration. Government and academic institutions have noted that these subsurface conditions may be conducive to hydrogen generation. MAX Power’s approach focuses on testing these zones directly rather than relying solely on geological modeling. This form of empirical measurement represents an important advance, as it provides real data that can be used to validate long-standing scientific theories. The company’s early findings highlight why the region may have significant potential and why global attention is turning toward places with large-scale land packages capable of hosting hydrogen systems. The Lawson Well: From Theory to Measured Evidence MAX Power’s Lawson well provides the first technical data set confirming the presence of natural hydrogen in the Canadian subsurface. The company reported natural hydrogen across multiple horizons, supported by gas sampling, chemical analysis and downhole logging tools capable of identifying trace hydrogen concentrations. These indicators are significant because they move natural hydrogen from theoretical potential to measurable evidence within the region. Prior to this work, much of the scientific understanding relied on surface seeps and global analogs. The Lawson results demonstrate that hydrogen may be present in multiple geological layers, broadening the scope for future exploration. The data sets collected from Lawson will be among the most comprehensive ever assembled for natural hydrogen anywhere in the world. This includes gas-geochemical measurements, core and cuttings analysis, and structural data that may help map hydrogen migration pathways. These findings will influence the design of future wells, including decisions about target depth, casing, and resource evaluation strategies. Independent analysis is currently underway by third-party scientific institutions. These assessments will help determine whether the hydrogen observed corresponds to deeper, potentially productive reservoirs. Confirmation of such systems would strengthen the case for developing a broader natural hydrogen industry in Saskatchewan. If follow-up wells exhibit similar results, Canada could become the first region in North America to establish a commercial natural hydrogen basin. The Genesis Trend: A Potential Basin-Scale System MAX Power’s exploration footprint includes the Genesis Trend, a minimum 300-mile geological corridor that extends from Saskatchewan into Montana and the Dakotas. The Genesis Trend contains structural features and rock types associated with hydrogen generation in other parts of the world, including deep crustal faults, reactive ultramafic rocks and pathways for fluid movement. MAX Power’s permitted acreage across the province spans 1.3 million acres, with an additional 5.7 million acres under review, creating the opportunity to evaluate whether the region hosts a large-scale hydrogen system. A second fully funded well, located approximately 200 miles from the Lawson site, is expected to soon test a different structural region. If drilling in this area reveals similar hydrogen signatures, it would greatly strengthen the interpretation that Saskatchewan may contain a basin-wide hydrogen system rather than isolated pockets. This kind of large-scale potential aligns with global research published in “Science Advances,” which describes how tectonically active geological settings can generate sustained hydrogen through ongoing rock-water reactions. Continuous hydrogen generation is considered one of the most compelling features of natural hydrogen systems. Unlike fossil fuels, which take millions of years to accumulate and are finite, geologic hydrogen may be produced continuously by Earth’s internal processes. If commercial flow rates are established, this could create a renewable-like energy resource with implications for grid baseload supply and industrial energy use. Leading Global Scientists Join the Effort MAX Power has attracted collaboration from respected scientific institutions as interest in natural hydrogen grows. According to company reports, experts from the Petroleum Technology Research Centre, the University of Regina, the Saskatchewan Geological Survey, and the Colorado School of Mines recently visited the Lawson site and are participating in data analysis. The involvement of these organizations lends credibility to MAX Power’s findings and strengthens the scientific understanding of natural hydrogen systems in Canada. These groups bring expertise in subsurface analysis, basin modeling, mineralogy, and gas characterization, all disciplines essential to determining whether hydrogen accumulations could become commercially viable. The Petroleum Technology Research Centre is well known for its work in subsurface resource evaluation, including carbon capture and geological storage. The University of Regina and Saskatchewan Geological Survey contribute regional geological knowledge and scientific rigor into the study of hydrogen-bearing formations. Specialists from the Colorado School of Mines add further insight from global research programs examining natural hydrogen potential. This multi-institution approach ensures that the data collected is interpreted using internationally recognized scientific standards. It also helps support Canada’s emergence as a research hub for geologic hydrogen, especially as global interest expands in response to the world’s increasing energy challenges. Leadership Aligns with Pivotal Moment MAX Power recently appointed Ran Narayanasamy as chief executive officer, bringing nearly two decades of experience from SaskPower and leadership at the Petroleum Technology Research Centre. His background in energy systems, subsurface research, and transition planning provides the company with expertise aligned to the technical and regulatory demands of natural hydrogen development. Narayanasamy’s long-standing relationships across energy, academic and government sectors may help accelerate the company’s progress as it advances Canada’s first dedicated natural hydrogen well. His leadership arrives at a critical moment, as the company transitions from early scientific confirmation toward testing commercial viability. As the first-mover public company in this space, MAX Power holds approximately 1.3 million permitted acres in Saskatchewan and has identified multiple high-priority targets. The company has drilled Canada’s first deep well specifically designed to evaluate natural hydrogen as a commercial resource. If these efforts confirm consistent flow rates, natural hydrogen could become a significant new source of clean baseload power positioned directly near industrial centers and agricultural corridors. The implications of such a discovery would be substantial. Natural hydrogen could complement or even replace some manufactured hydrogen pathways, offering cleaner production and potentially lower costs. The combination of scientific progress, expanding technical datasets, and strengthened executive leadership positions MAX Power at the forefront of an evolving clean-energy sector. With growing interest from policymakers, researchers and global investors alike, the company’s development timeline coincides with what may be the early stage of the next major energy transition.

Title: He predicted an automation crisis years ago. Now, Andrew Yang says AI may wipe out 40 million jobs over the next decade.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Andrew Yang has warned for several years that automation would upend the American workforce. In the run-up to his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he predicted that self-driving cars alone could displace a million mostly male truck drivers with limited education — a shift that could "destabilize society" and even trigger "riots in the street," he told The New York Times in 2018. Seven years later, Yang says the crisis he feared is no longer hypothetical. "It's aging very, very well, unfortunately," he told CNN's Michael Smerconish of his predictions in a recent interview. Recent analyses indicate that AI and automation are already capable of performing a significant share of US labor tasks and are reshaping employment. MIT's Iceberg Index, released last week, found that current AI systems can already technically perform skills representing 11.7% of the US labor market — roughly $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and professional services. The New York Times, citing internal Amazon strategy documents and interviews, reported in October that the company believes automation could allow it to avoid hiring more than 600,000 US workers over the next few years, and that its robotics team has an ultimate goal of automating 75% of its operations. Salesforce, Walmart, HP, IBM, and Fiverr have all cited AI in recent rounds of layoffs or announced layoffs tied to AI. "44% of American jobs are either repetitive manual or repetitive cognitive and thus could be subject to AI and automation," Yang said in the interview with CNN. "We're seeing that unfold right now." Yang's 44% estimate is broadly in line with some major studies on automation. An IMF analysis from 2024 suggested that around 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI, with half benefiting from the technology and the other being negatively impacted by it. A McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report released last month found that technologies could theoretically automate more than half of US work hours. Yang pushed back against Roman Yampolskiy, a computer science professor at the University of Louisville and an AI safety researcher, who in September predicted 99% unemployment within five years. "It's going to get bad. I certainly don't think 99% bad," Yang said. Using his 44% vulnerability benchmark, Yang offered a rough projection: if the US "churns through" even half of those jobs over the next decade, the country could see 30 to 40 million positions eliminated. "That would be devastating," he said. "That would be catastrophic for many, many communities." The rapid pace of AI-driven disruption has revived Yang's signature policy idea: a universal basic income that gives every American adult $1,000 a month, no strings attached. He said guaranteed cash would help workers survive the shockwaves of automation and maintain basic economic stability. To fund a nationwide program, Yang said the firms driving AI's explosive growth should bear the cost. He cited Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who floated to Axios in May the idea of a "token tax" that the government should levy on AI companies. With tech giants generating "hundreds of billions" in value — powered in part by data the public never knowingly provided — Yang said an AI tax or "compute tax" could raise "very big numbers very quickly." Given that the US produced roughly $85,000 in GDP per person in 2024, according to the World Bank, Yang said his $12,000 annual Freedom Dividend "seems pretty modest and reasonable." Yang said that a cash stipend isn't a cure-all — people also need purpose, structure, and a sense of community. But without financial stability, he said, millions risk being left behind and pushed toward radicalization. "We could be doing much, much more for the millions of Americans who are going to be displaced," Yang said. Jump to

Title: Here's why everyone's talking about a 'K-shaped' economy

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” In this June 15, 2018 file photo, twenty dollar bills are counted in North Andover, Mass. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, the Bank of America Institute found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” This photo combination shows, from Fairlife milk on display at an Indianapolis grocery store, Jan. 23, 2015, Coca-Cola cans displayed at a grocery store in Mount Prospect, Ill., July 17, 2025, and bottles of Lifewtr and Smartwater displayed in Philadelphia, March 16, 2017. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy, Nam Y. Huh, Matt Rourke) Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained ... between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” A security guard is seen next to a road block near the New York Stock exchange, Jan. 14, 2022, in the Financial District. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. ___ AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

Title: How Campbell’s leaked audio turned a pantry staple into a PR crisis
URL: https://fortune.com/article/campbell-leaked-audio-pr-crisis-comms-soup-meat/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T12:17:05Z
Full Content:
Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Just as families across the U.S. were heading into Thanksgiving weekend and stocking up on Campbell’s staples, a leaked audio recording landed online of a company vice president mocking Indian workers, calling customers “poor people,” and claiming its soups contained “bioengineered” or “3D” meat. The timing was combustible. A brand associated with holiday comfort was suddenly overshadowed by a senior leader’s contemptuous voice, directed at the very people who buy and make its products. Campbell confirmed the recording’s believed authenticity and removed the executive from his role. Several elements of the story emerged through a lawsuit filed by cybersecurity analyst Robert Garza, who alleges he told his manager about the comments in January, was discouraged from reporting them, and was later terminated. Campbell disputes that timeline, saying it first learned of the lawsuit months later and heard only “segments” of the audio on November 20. Regardless of how those details are adjudicated, once the recording went public, the question shifted from one executive’s conduct to the organization’s ability to confront issues before they escalate. These alleged events surfaced three essential truths about leadership that extend far beyond this single episode. The blowback was swift because Campbell is not merely a food manufacturer. Its products occupy a symbolic place on holiday tables, and the remarks felt like a direct insult to the households that rely on them. Consumers interpreted the comments as a reflection of how a leader with influence viewed the people who sustain the brand. Culture is judged in moments like this—not by corporate messaging but by private conduct that contradicts it. The allegations about internal handling reveal a more profound leadership truth: Trust within companies is fragile. Reporting systems work only when employees believe their concerns will be taken seriously rather than met with indifference or retaliation. When people think the organization is unwilling or unable to act, the crisis becomes bigger than the initial misconduct. The episode also highlights the modern fact that private comments are never entirely private. Power attracts scrutiny, and the tools to record unguarded moments are everywhere. The answer is to ensure that even one’s private behavior is consistent with the values the company claims to uphold. The final takeaway: What happened at Campbell ultimately reinforces why leadership is judged at its edges. The quiet moments and the offhand comments reveal far more about a leader’s integrity and C-suite readiness than any formal performance review ever could.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location. For more great discounts, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: HP to Lay Off 4,000 to 6,000 Employees Over the Next 3 Years

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. HP will cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs by 2028 as the company leans into AI adoption, CEO Enrique Lores said during a Q4 earnings call. This "company-wide initiative [aims to] drive customer satisfaction, product innovation, and productivity through artificial intelligence adoption and enablement," HP says. The layoffs will primarily affect those in product development, internal operations, and customer support roles, and are expected to be implemented by the end of fiscal year 2028. HP expects the job cuts to save nearly $1 billion by the end of 2028. "Structural cost savings represent gross reductions in costs driven by operational efficiency, digital transformation, and portfolio optimization," HP says. "These initiatives include but are not limited to workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation and productivity measures undertaken by HP, which HP expects to be sustainable in the longer-term." Lores promised to provide "the full plan on how AI is transforming HP" at the company's Investor Day on April 23. HP cut a similar number of jobs in 2022; it also laid off 9,000 people in 2019. As of October 2024, HP's headcount reportedly stood at 58,000, meaning the recently announced layoffs could reduce the workforce by about 7-10%. Notably, the company's PC business closed the fiscal year with a net revenue of $10.4 billion, an 8% year-over-year growth, while its printer business brought in $4.3 billion, down 4% year over year. HP now joins a long list of tech giants announcing layoffs due to AI-driven restructuring or cost cuts. Intel said it would reduce 15% of its workforce in June; Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs in July; Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October; and Verizon just cut 13,000 jobs last month.

Title: DoorDash CEO Tony Xu outmaneuvered meal delivery rivals by obsessing over his customer

Good morning. If Americans treated their post-Thanksgiving Day exhaustion with take-out this weekend, there’s a good chance they ordered from DoorDash. The meal delivery giant now controls 60% of the market in the U.S and is more than twice the size of its closest competitor, Uber Eats. It wasn’t always that way. In a new Fortune feature, tech correspondent Jason Del Rey rode along with DoorDash CEO Tony Xu on a delivery run and got a front-seat look at how Xu built the scrappy upstart into an unexpected powerhouse in the cutthroat meal delivery industry. The startup founded in 2013 by Xu and three fellow Stanford students once had less than $30,000 left in its bank account. Now, thanks to grit, ingenuity, and a heaping serving of luck, it’s on track to generate more than $13 billion this year. Here a few lessons other leaders can learn from DoorDash and CEO Xu:Zig when others zag: Early on, DoorDash distinguished itself in the crowded meal delivery space by enlisting gig workers to pick up—and sometimes even order—food, whereas then-rivals Grubhub and Seamless only partnered with restaurants that had their own delivery drivers. Obsess over your customer: Xu prides himself on sweating the small stuff to improve service. For instance, DoorDash now highlights desserts on orders because they are the most likely to be forgotten. Its app also advises “Dashers” on where to park and which building entrance to use. Stay in touch with the front-line experience: Every corporate DoorDash employee in the U.S. must do four delivery shifts a year. On Jason’s ride-along, CEO Xu attempted to deliver four orders in San Francisco. He managed to drop off three and earned $19 for the hour’s worth of work. (DoorDash would top up that amount.) Xu’s hands-on experience stands out in a world in which the ultra-wealthy are living increasingly private lives. Strike when there’s blood: When Uber Eats’ parent was rehabilitating its culture and imposing financial discipline in the late 2010s, DoorDash went on a spending blitz. It poached several UberEats executives and expanded from 1,500 locations to 6,000, including into mid-tier cities and suburban towns that rivals had neglected. Be ready when opportunity hits: DoorDash’s investment in the suburbs paid off when the COVID pandemic pushed convenience-obsessed consumers out of cities and turned sit-down restaurants on to delivery. DoorDash’s business more than tripled in 2020. Jason cautions that DoorDash’s lead isn’t safe. It could “be displaced by a competitor like Uber—or an AI-native company that may not yet even exist.” But for now it’s won the meal delivery wars and is moving into new markets, like grocery delivery, where the battle for dominance may be just as fierce. You can read the full feature here. —Claire ZillmanContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump to announce Fed chair pick U.S. President Donald Trump says he’s decided who will succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair. “We’ll be announcing it,” he said Sunday. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly the frontrunner for the job but declined to address whether he was the top candidate in an interview Sunday. Gen Z penny-pinching Gen Z shoppers, those in their teens to early 20s, plan on spending less this holiday season as economic uncertainty takes hold. A Deloitte survey shows they plan to cut spending 34% this year, steeper than any other cohort. Only Gen Xers, aged 45 to 60, plan to spend more. Frozen salaries Major consulting firms like McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group have frozen starting salaries for the third straight year as AI imposes more cautious hiring practices in the industry. AI is making junior employees more productive, putting downward pressure on their pay. Smartphone risks for kids A new study in the journal Pediatrics finds that children who had a smartphone by age 12 were at higher risk of depression, obesity, and inadequate sleep compared to their phoneless peers. The research included 10,500 kids in the U.S., making it the largest long-term look at children’s brain development in the country to date. AI job displacement An MIT study published last week found that nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce could already be replaced by AI systems. The report notably found that AI models can complete tasks in finance and health care, not just in technology or coding. Great Wealth Transfer won’t be a ‘big bang’ Northwestern Mutual CEO Tim Gerend told Fortune that the Great Wealth Transfer between Baby Boomers and younger generations won’t be a “big bang” like many expect but instead will come gradually. For young people who are “really anxious” about the economy, per Gerend, waiting for that inheritance only adds to their unease. S&P 500 futures are down 0.55% this morning. The last session closed up 0.54%. STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.44% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.03% in earning trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.89%. China’s CSI 300 was up 1.10%. The South Korea KOSPI was down 0.16%. India’s NIFTY 50 is down 0.10%. Bitcoin was down at $87K. Ford workers told their CEO ‘none of the young people want to work here.’ So Jim Farley took a page out of the founder’s playbook by Sasha Rogelberg Harvard professor says leaders have a responsibility to be happy at work because it can affect your stock price by Dave Smith From Martha Stewart to Dockers to Toys “R” Us, brand managers are raking in billions betting on classic American names by Amanda Gerut McDonald’s promoted its new $8 nugget combo meal, then got blasted online with complaints about affordability, quality and service by Nino Paoli CEO Daily is compiled and edited by Joey Abrams and Claire Zillman.

Title: Sources of America’s Hidden Inflation

Time Published: 2025-12-01T10:30:00Z

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Prices have been rising across the economy in ways that are both visible and opaque. There are short-term drivers of inflation due to President Trump’s mismanagement of the economy. But the deeper drivers result from the degradation of capitalism. For example, the lethal combination of digital technology and tech monopolies picks your pocket in countless ways. Instead of technical advances leading to greater convenience and lower cost, as they logically should, they create strategies for opportunistic price hikes. More from Robert Kuttner When Amazon uses its deep knowledge of consumer preferences to rig markets and undermine competitors, higher prices are passed along. When HP makes it illegal or impossible for consumers to use cheaper non-HP cartridges in their printers, it can charge exorbitant prices. If you are prohibited from repairing your own car or your own iPhone, or as a farmer, prohibited from saving seed for next year’s planting, that invites monopoly profits built on higher prices. Costs rise because the rules are rigged. It isn’t just the increasing cost of health insurance, but the tax on your time when a health system of byzantine complexity requires you to waste hours to get a simple referral or get a claim paid. Middlemen and algorithms, both in the business of denying claims, are a direct cost to the system and a source of rising out-of-pocket prices to patients. If insurance doesn’t pay, you do. These middlemen also function as a drain on doctor time and thus a tax on doctors’ incomes, as well as a debasement of medical services In this special issue of the Prospect, we take stock of several hidden drivers of rising costs. David Dayen explores all the ways that technology allows sellers of any product that uses the internet to take advantage of surveillance capitalism to personalize prices and charge more than the market price that would be produced by ordinary supply and demand. It’s another case of monopoly pricing power, facilitated by invasive technology. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. As Emma Janssen writes, plutocracy is a driver of the affordability crisis. The top 10 percent of income earners now do close to half of the spending, by some estimates. This has led to “premiumization,” where airline seats, concert tickets, and even staple goods are priced for wealthier people because they are the primary buyers. That in turn drives prices higher for everyone else, as anyone who buys a ticket to a concert or a sporting event appreciates. Antitrust policy has thus far failed to curb obvious abuses by middlemen ticket sellers. Paul Starr writes in a sidebar that these trends invert the 20th-century pattern of affordable culture, beginning with nickel movie tickets and cheap bleacher seats. As the concert ticket example shows, middlemen are drivers of the affordability crisis. As Whitney Curry Wimbish writes, across the economy, from pharmaceuticals to real estate to meatpacking and more, middlemen sit in between suppliers and customers and squeeze out a layer of profit for themselves, taking advantage of their knowledge of industries and typically concentrated control of the supply chain. Regulatory capture, as James Baratta points out, is another source of price increases. Baratta’s focus is on electricity rates, and the failure of state public utility commissions to protect ratepayers from extractive price hikes based on dubious economic models used by utility companies. There is an even more subtle and insidious version of regulatory capture, in which regulations themselves are used to enforce industry’s anti-competitive strategies. As Cory Doctorow observes in his indispensable book Enshittification (reviewed in our October issue), far more sinister than traditional regulatory capture is regulatory fusion, in which industry designs laws and rules to thwart competition and raise profits. Using provisions of the industry-written 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Apple makes it a copyright violation for technicians to use non-Apple parts for most repairs to Apple products. The preposterous doctrine is that if an inferior non-Apple part caused the product to fail, that could reduce consumer confidence in Apple’s brand. There is even a name for this doctrine: tarnishment. TRUMP’S CONTRIBUTION TO RISING PRICES adds to these long-term abuses. Eric Winograd, a senior vice president at AllianceBernstein, calculates that Trump’s tariffs have added about one percentage point to the core inflation rate, though other estimates that account for Trump’s numerous exemptions of various products and industries put the number at 0.6 to 0.7 percent. But tariffs are only the beginning of Trump’s impact on prices. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. Internet innovators grew from purveyors of ingenuity and user convenience into extractive monopolies largely because antitrust enforcement ceased to exist from late in the Carter administration until Joe Biden’s appointments of some of the smartest students of abuses and their remedies: Lina Khan at the FTC, Jonathan Kanter at the Justice Department, Rohit Chopra at the CFPB, and Tim Wu (whose latest book is reviewed in these pages) as competition policy chief at the White House. These agencies had just gotten serious about reversing four decades of corporate market power when the antitrust revolution was reversed by Trump. As antitrust enforcement has been aborted, private equity companies have been buying up traditionally local firms in order to use market power to raise prices, in sectors as diverse as pest control operations, HVAC companies, and veterinary practices In addition, Trump’s shutting down of Biden’s industrial policies has raised prices. Electric power costs have lately risen far faster than the general rate of inflation. Trump’s policy of killing renewable-energy projects, in order to raise profits for oil and gas companies, contributes to this price rise, by taking away power that might otherwise come onto the grid and alleviate demand. So does the failure to regulate the extensive use of electric power by data centers used by tech companies. There was a time when we needed to shift to solar and wind in order to help address climate change. But now that renewables are cheaper than most fossil fuels, we need to make that shift because it saves money. Instead, Trump promotes more costly oil and gas. It is hard to quantify precisely how much all of Trump’s policies taken together have added to price inflation, but a very conservative estimate would be about two percentage points. That may not sound like a lot, but it is the difference between a baseline inflation rate of 2.5 percent and a rate of 4.5 percent. And that difference is not just a hidden tax on consumers. It has knock-on effects. With inflation at 2.5 percent, the Federal Reserve is willing to reduce interest rates in order to reduce unemployment. But when price increases approach 4 percent, the Fed worries more about inflation. At a time when unemployment rates are rising, policies that raise prices tie the Fed’s hands. This paradoxically could make things more unaffordable for low-income workers, if a loose job market keeps wages from rising. It’s not clear whether there will be any more rate cuts in the near future, and there may even be rate increases. A Fed policy of tighter money means that people pay more for their mortgage loans, their credit card debt, their student loans, and consumers pay more when small businesses pay more for credit. Trump’s cuts in programs such as SNAP and Medicaid are another form of indirect price hikes; even worse, they are price hikes that hit the poor. If your food stamp allotment is reduced, you have to pay more out of pocket in order to eat. If your Medicaid is cut, you pay out of pocket or do without. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. The failure to address climate change, and Trump’s reversal of long-standing policies aimed at preserving the environment, also add to costs. As destructive storms become more severe and frequent, the costs of recovery and of homeowner insurance relentlessly rise, some borne by consumers directly and some by taxpayers. This natural-world aspect of hidden inflation is addressed in another of our special articles, by Gabrielle Gurley. SOME YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A DEBATE among economists and policymakers about whether the Consumer Price Index should be adjusted downward to reflect improvements in quality. A 2020 car was simply a better car than a 1980 car, so some of the nominal price inflation actually represented a superior product. Likewise coffee: In 1970, a cup of coffee only cost a dime, but the swill was undrinkable. Coffee today is a lot more expensive, but it is palatable. In practice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics did some minor revisions to adjust for quality improvements. Today, we might need to do the reverse. We are paying more money for products and services whose quality has deteriorated. And in many cases, the deterioration has been deliberate. Indeed, the business model of the tech giants is to systematically degrade the quality of products and services. Products are needlessly complex from the perspective of the consumer, but the complexity adds to the surveillance. Same with tech services. This is the essence of what Doctorow calls enshittification. Doctorow tells the story of how Google deliberately slowed down its search process in order to make more time for its system to festoon the search results with annoying ads that embody everything that Google knows about the user’s buying habits. In conventional economics, wages and prices are two different aspects of the economy. But whether people can afford to live decently is a function of what they earn applied to what they have to pay to live. The same technology that allows tech monopolists to gouge consumers enables them to treat workers like serfs and evade the protections of labor law. As Harold Meyerson writes in his piece, the cost of living is higher because earnings are lower. And earnings are lower because of both the weakening of the labor movement and the sidelining of the National Labor Relations Board. In addition, tech allows employers to double down on the old practice of denying that workers are payroll employees protected by labor laws. From Uber drivers and UPS contractors to chicken farmers and fast-food workers, the company controls and monitors every aspect of the work, but the employer pretends that the workers are independent contractors. This represents a toxic marriage of app technology and market power. The effect is to batter down earnings. And as Naomi Bethune writes, all of the predations tend to hit racial and ethnic minorities harder, because African Americans and Latinos are more economically vulnerable to begin with. Trump’s war on DEI only increases the vulnerability. EVEN APART FROM THE PREDATIONS of extractive and invasive capitalism, other sources of the relentless rise in prices are the result of policy failures that predate the abuses of surveillance capitalism and Donald Trump by decades. Housing is out of reach for so many Americans because America has failed to build enough houses. Houses were cheap after World War II mainly because cheap farmland was being converted to suburbia, with the help of federal highway and mortgage policies. The cheap land is gone, and homebuilder consolidation has distorted markets. Trump’s tariffs have caused a rise in building costs, and his proposal to privatize the secondary mortgage market would make financing more expensive. Housing tax breaks are tilted toward more expensive homes, and toward homeowners over renters. The sheer purchasing power of the oligarchy also bids up prices. Local regulatory barriers also raise costs, but many zoning restrictions also reflect the political power of oligarchs, who don’t want riffraff in their neighborhoods. The bipartisan failure to regulate new financial scams such as subprime mortgages added to the pressure on housing. Millions of homeowners, disproportionately Black and Hispanic, lost their homes in the wake of the subprime collapse. Congress passed legislation to allow for mortgage refinancing for duped homeowners, but the Obama administration failed to carry it out. You might think that scads of vacant and foreclosed houses would lead to lower prices via the law of supply and demand. But the same regulatory failure led private equity companies to swoop in, buy houses, and jack up prices and rents, while making homebuilders reluctant to build the additional units we need. Public policy has also failed to produce an adequate supply of affordable rental housing. The rental housing that we do subsidize is done in wildly inefficient ways, for the convenience and profit of landlords and developers. Our failure to have a true social-housing sector reflects power imbalances between oligarchs and ordinary citizens. The cost of higher education is out of sight because legislators, Republican and Democrat alike, permitted universities to inflate costs via the student loan program, and then piled debt onto generations of students and graduates. State legislatures compounded the damage by reducing direct appropriations to public universities that were free to state residents until a generation ago, substituting tuition and fees. It now costs more to attend a state university than what a private university cost when I was a student. Health care costs also keep rising because the United States has failed to adopt an efficient program of universal public health insurance, as every other major country has done. To compound the damage, policymakers have allowed a plague of for-profit middlemen to take over hospitals, nursing homes, and doctors’ practices. In many hospitals, people of means hire private nurses because the hospital’s own nursing staff is so stretched thin and overworked by cost-cutting aimed at siphoning profits. A hidden price hike, if you can afford it. If the U.S. had a universal nonprofit insurance system, it would save about 6 percent of GDP. That’s $1.2 trillion a year. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE ABUSES of capitalism were relatively straightforward and transparent. Large corporations sought to combine into monopolies. The remedy was enactment and enforcement of antitrust laws. Corporations tried to pay their workers as little as possible and to break their unions. The remedy was the Wagner Act, guaranteeing workers the right to organize and join unions. Bankers tried to swindle investors for their own enrichment. The remedy was tougher banking and securities laws, prohibiting conflicts of interest. Corporations tried to cheat consumers with tricky terms and shoddy products. The remedy was the pro-consumer legislation of the 1960s and 1970s. But today’s corporate and financial abuses are hidden in a web of algorithms and apps, reinforced by regulations that actually help tech companies cheat consumers rather than protect them. It takes a complex, deeply knowledgeable, and radical critique of capitalism as currently practiced to get serious about remedies. That does not describe about half of the current Democratic Party, which is on the take from these same industries. One of the many tragedies of Joe Biden was that he was a feeble spokesman for his own good policies. He hired the most knowledgeable people in the country to revive antitrust and apply it to new abuses. But Biden did poorly at narrating the significance of these policies to ordinary Americans coping with rising prices. As I’ve written elsewhere, many of these policies and people reflected the work of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was a superb narrator of what they meant and why we needed them. But we ended up with the soul of Elizabeth Warren in the feckless persona of Joe Biden. If we can make the heroic assumption that Trump will not be president forever, and that there will be an opportunity to pick up where Biden and Warren left off, America’s next leaders will need to be even more radical in their understanding and remediation of capitalism, which has become even more debased since Trump took office.

Just because Cyber Monday is over doesn't mean you missed out. We've spent the past several days (and nights!) tracking some of the best deals of the year, and while some of the best Cyber Monday sales ended promptly at midnight, we were pleased to see so many of them extending their discounts through this week. Some of the best ongoing deals we've spotted include 30% off a pair of Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, the best overall headphones we've tested, and 55% off the Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum. We're also still seeing multiple discounts on Apple smartwatches, including the brand-new Apple Watch SE 3, which is $50 off. And if you're starting to shop for the holidays and looking for something for the kids in your life, several giftable items are on sale, including up to 33% off the classic Razor scooter that you (and your ankles) might remember from your own childhood. Some stores share the details surrounding their promotional periods, while others don't have a specific publicized end date, so we recommend acting now if you see something you're interested in. Keep scrolling to explore some of the best deals still available, including offers on tech, streaming, home, kitchen, beauty, pets, and more. Our whole team has been working around the clock to cover all of this holiday's best deals, but as the editor who keeps a close eye on all categories year-round, I have a few favorite discounts. These are five sales that are especially rare or low, including some products that weren't even on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday. — Sarah Saril, Editor, Deals and How to Watch This massive 14-qt. air fryer is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. The Magnus Pro has incredibly thoughtful cable management and supportive add-ons that make it a great choice for gamers, streamers, and anyone who uses multiple monitors and accessories. The Switch 2 comes with a range of new features for Nintendo gamers, including enhanced Joy-Con designs, improved performance, and more. This bundle comes with Mario Kart World, one of the console's exclusive titles, so you can get started playing right away. With their celebrity creators, high production value, and intuitive app, MasterClass videos feel more like edutainment than traditional online courses. STARZ offers blockbuster movies and popular original series like Outlander, Party Down, and Power. This deal on the annual plan makes the service incredibly affordable, and even better, it comes with zero ads. There are five deals that I was pleased to see extend past Cyber Monday, ranging from can't-miss streaming service bundles to discounts on beloved hair dryers. A few of these offers will stick around until January, but others will most likely have a more limited lifespan. — Lillian Brown, Senior Associate Editor of Streaming This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price. This compact massage gun boasts a convenient, travel-friendly design that remains powerful enough to deliver effective results. We also love its heated head, which we've found to speed up recovery. Garmin's Forerunner 165 is a runner's best friend. It offers key features like performance monitoring, personalized training plans, and recovery details. This Nespresso model pairs the brand's centrifugal brewing technology with a small countertop footprint and an elegant profile. Pair it with the bundled Aeroccino frother, and you have a coffeehouse setup at home. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. We've logged several solid price drops over the past few days, including discounts on headphones, gaming consoles, and smart home tech. You can also still save on electronic services like VPNs (virtual private networks) or cellular providers. The WH-1000XM5 are one of Sony’s top over-ear headphones. They boast excellent noise-canceling performance along with great audio quality and a truckload of convenient features. JLab’s Go Air Pop are the most affordable wireless earbuds that are actually still worth buying. This simple two-channel soundbar is an affordable yet capable audio system. It delivers good stereo separation and Bluetooth support. However, though it's technically capable of Dolby Atmos playback, it lacks the ability to showcase that format properly. Bose’s oil can-sized Portable Smart Speaker offers big sound, wireless charging capability, and compatibility with both Amazon’s and Google’s virtual assistants. It also boasts versatile connectivity options and strong functionality. If you're new to smart lighting, then the Philips Hue Starter Kit is a great place to begin. The Philips Hue light bulbs are easy to use and set up. This kit includes four bulbs and a Hue Bridge, a wireless hub that connects to your router. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, now with no data caps. We recommend signing up for this option to maximize your savings, as it's typically the most expensive option in the lineup. Mint Mobile's annual unlimited plan offers unlimited talk and text and truly unlimited high-speed data on T-Mobile's network (subject to deprioritization) for an unrivaled value at $15/month with a limited-time discount. Surfshark's VPN deal is one of the most affordable around and comes with three months extra for free, with prices starting from $1.99 a month. Unlike much of the competition, you can use it on an unlimited number of devices at once. The starter tier is more than enough for most users as it features robust encryption and will unlock international streaming with ease. The middle tier is only a touch more expensive and has extra features like a private search engine, antivirus, breach alerts, and more. NordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs. This new VPN deal drops the per-month price as low as $2.99 on a two-year plan, and you get an additional three months extra for no charge. Looking for an alternative VPN still packed with useful features and servers in over 110 countries? Then ProtonVPN is well worth a look, and it has a sizable discount on its two-year plan. If you'd prefer a shorter-term deal, the one-year plan is great value too and only costs $3.99 a month with the current 60% discount. Both plans can be used across 10 devices at once and feature a great ad-blocker, split tunneling, and more security-conscious features. TVs can get pricey, but these deals can help cut down on some of the costs of enhancing your home theater. We've found sales for some notable models, including gorgeous OLED sets with incredible contrast, wallet-friendly QLED options that still deliver plenty of brightness, and even stylish Frame TVs that double as artwork when they're not in use. Though we think the larger versions of Amazon's Omni QLED TV are overpriced for what you get, the 50-inch model offers an excellent balance between cost and performance. It has handy Alexa features and is one of the only 50-inch TVs available with local dimming, which enables solid contrast performance. The Hisense U8QG impresses with one of the brightest pictures on the market, and pairs that searing luminance with excellent contrast for a dynamic, punchy picture. Samsung's Frame TV is designed to look like a piece of art on your wall thanks to its flush mount, matte screen, and magnetic frame bezels. Its image quality is mediocre, but its style makes it a great pick for design-focused buyers. Walmart's Onn TVs are entry-level displays sold at highly competitive prices. Although their image quality is lacking, they still offer reliable Roku streaming. Onn TVs are decent budget buys if you're looking for an inexpensive set for casual viewing or a secondary room. The Roku Plus Series is the brand's most affordable QLED TV model. This new 2025 edition uses a Mini LED backlight for improved local dimming but it still can't match the HDR brightness capabilities of the step-up Pro Series. If you're looking for a more affordable alternative to Samsung's Frame TV, Hisense's Canvas is a solid option. It has a similar matte screen, slim mount, and bezel system. That said, it lacks the Frame's One Connect Box, and its viewing angles aren't great. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. The QN90F is one of the few premium QLED TVs made in a 50-inch screen size. It offers a bright image and features Samsung's anti-reflective matte screen, which significantly reduces glare. The S90F is an impressive midrange OLED and one of our favorite new displays of 2025. It gets a bit brighter than last year's S90D and offers better color volume than similar LG OLED models. The 83-inch C5 is a standout midrange OLED TV in this size. It offers an infinite contrast ratio and inky black levels while providing a modest boost in brightness compared to last year's C4 model. Several streaming sales ended with Cyber Monday, but there are still a few stellar offers available. Services with ongoing deals span from family-friendly apps, such as Disney Plus, to more targeted streamers, like Starz. A few of these deals can help you save on up to 12 months of service, a great way to temporarily ward off potential price hikes. This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price.

Now that the day is done and dusted, remaining deals are starting to run dry, so time is running out to shop. Almost all major retailers offered discounts for Cyber Monday, including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as specialized retailers like B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can run out of stock quickly, so online shopping often gives you the best shot at grabbing what’s left. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and some extended them into Cyber Monday. While the official event is over, a handful of last‑minute bargains are still live today, but they won’t last much longer. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We've rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll continue to highlight the best lingering deals throughout this extended sale period. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive, the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

Cyber Monday 2025 officially took place on Dec. 1, but some deals are still available at Amazon today, giving shoppers extra time to snag savings. A Prime membership isn't required to shop Amazon's lingering Cyber Monday deals, but some discounts are exclusive to Prime members -- particularly on Amazon's own devices. If you're unsure whether Prime is worth it, consider the other benefits you get with a membership, like faster shipping and bundled perks. Like most major retailers, Amazon is offering huge discounts across a wide range of tech, including headphones, TVs, speakers, tablets and more. Outside of Prime Day, Cyber Monday is the best time of year to score big savings on Amazon's own devices like smart speakers, security cameras and streaming gear (though many of these deals are Prime‑exclusive). With many of the top Cyber Monday deals still live on Amazon, now is a great time to upgrade your tech or check off holiday gifts. It's also a great opportunity to pick up holiday decorations or grab outdoor gear for next year, as retailers clear out remaining seasonal inventory. Both events deliver superb offers across categories, but Prime Day leans heavily on Amazon products such as TVs, smart home devices and Prime membership perks. Members get access to far more exclusive discounts during Prime Day. Cyber Monday, on the other hand, casts a wider net. Virtually all product types from all brands see major markdowns, and while there are still Prime‑exclusive offers, they're fewer compared to Prime Day.

Title: FedEx to close Texas logistics hub, cutting 856 jobs as âforever layoffâ trend grows

FedEx is closing a Coppell, Texas facility and permanently laying off 856 employees. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider. This follows other recent FedEx job cuts across North Texas facilities. The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider.

The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The American worker is under siege again, this time in the heart of Texas. In a move that exposes the fragile state of our economy and the disposable view corporations often hold of their workforce, FedEx is shuttering a Coppell logistics facility and laying off 856 employees. The cuts, set to begin in January with the facility closing by April 2026, follow the loss of a major customer to a competitor. This isn't an isolated incident but part of an unsettling pattern of endless job cuts eroding the foundation of the American middle class. FedEx, in its filing with the Texas Workforce Commission, coldly stated the reason: âThis action is necessitated solely by our customerâs decision to transition its business to a new location that will be managed by a new third-party logistics provider.â With that bureaucratic language, nearly 900 livelihoods are deemed expendable. The company noted the closure is âexpected to be permanent.â A pattern of cuts across North Texas The Coppell disaster is merely the latest blow from FedEx in the region. This past spring, the company announced 305 layoffs at a Fort Worth facility and another 131 at sites in Garland and Plano. These repeated reductions paint a picture of a contracting operation, not a growing enterprise supporting robust communities. FedEx representative Adam Snyder offered a standard corporate script, saying, âTeam members at this facility were notified in advance, and some will be eligible for other roles within the company, including at other FedEx facilities in the area.â The company pledges âjob placement assistance, relocation aid, or severance, as applicable.â But for many long-term employees, this is cold comfort. It represents a forced uprooting and the stressful scramble for new work in an increasingly hostile job market, all because a faceless client chose a different provider. The rise of the "forever layoff" This FedEx news is a single symptom of a national economic sickness. We are witnessing the normalization of what analysts grimly call the âforever layoff.â Companies have shifted from rare, large-scale restructuring to a constant drip of smaller cuts, creating a perpetual state of anxiety for workers. Job review service Glassdoor notes this trend is expected to âstoke worker anxiety as it continues in 2026.â The data is alarming. Layoffs of fewer than 50 people, which made up just 38% of cuts in 2015, now account for 51%. Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray, & Christmas observed, âOver the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so itâs surprising to see so many in October.â The brutal timing of these announcements, often just before the holidays, shows an erosion of corporate conscience. The broader landscape is bleak. Major pillars of employment like Amazon, UPS, and Target have announced tens of thousands of job cuts recently. UPS alone has cut about 48,000 jobs this year. Nationally, we are on pace for a staggering 19.2 million layoffs annually, with 1.6 million workers handed pink slips each month. What does this say about the true state of the American economy? It speaks of a system where workers are the first and easiest cost to cut, where loyalty is a one-way street, and where the pursuit of efficiency and shareholder value trumps community stability and human dignity. The post-pandemic hiring boom has gone decisively bust, replaced by a cold, calculating corporate retrenchment. The FedEx layoffs in Coppell are a microcosm of this failure. A community will be impacted, local economies will feel the loss, and hundreds of families face an uncertain future. Itâs a harsh reminder that in todayâs economy, job security is an illusion for millions. As the "forever layoffs" continue to roll, one must question what kind of nation we are building when the engines of commerce so readily discard the very people who keep them running. The promise of stability that once defined American employment is being systematically broken, and the human cost is measured in thousands of notifications, just like the one filed in Texas.

Sources for this article include: FreightWaves.com Fox4News.com TheStreet.com The Coppell disaster is merely the latest blow from FedEx in the region. This past spring, the company announced 305 layoffs at a Fort Worth facility and another 131 at sites in Garland and Plano. These repeated reductions paint a picture of a contracting operation, not a growing enterprise supporting robust communities. FedEx representative Adam Snyder offered a standard corporate script, saying, âTeam members at this facility were notified in advance, and some will be eligible for other roles within the company, including at other FedEx facilities in the area.â The company pledges âjob placement assistance, relocation aid, or severance, as applicable.â But for many long-term employees, this is cold comfort. It represents a forced uprooting and the stressful scramble for new work in an increasingly hostile job market, all because a faceless client chose a different provider. The rise of the "forever layoff" This FedEx news is a single symptom of a national economic sickness. We are witnessing the normalization of what analysts grimly call the âforever layoff.â Companies have shifted from rare, large-scale restructuring to a constant drip of smaller cuts, creating a perpetual state of anxiety for workers.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location. For more great discounts, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

Title: PagerDuty Falls to ~$1B Market Cap on $500M ARR. Just 2x ARR. Profitable Isn’t Enough. You Have to Grow.

by Jason Lemkin | 5 Interesting Things, Blog Posts, Scale PagerDuty just reported earnings, and the numbers tell a sobering story. The Captain Obvious lesson and reminder: Growth Remains King. Even if you are profitable. You just have to grow. And for now at least — PagerDuty just isn’t growing anymore. Here’s where they are today: And yet the stock is down 75%+ from its 2021 highs. Down nearly 50% from its IPO price of $38.25 back in 2019. Profitable isn’t enough. You have to grow. PagerDuty has built something real. Almost $500M in ARR. Over 15,000 paying customers. One-third of the Fortune 500. Customers like Cisco, Zoom, Fox, Shopify, and the NYSE. A 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Nearly $550M in cash on the balance sheet. 83%+ gross margins. This is a real business. A profitable business. A business that serves mission-critical use cases — when systems go down at 2am, PagerDuty is the one waking up the right engineer. And the market values it at 2x ARR. Meanwhile, companies still growing 30%+ trade at 10-15x ARR or more or higher. That’s a 5-7x difference in multiple. The lesson: A dollar of ARR growing 30%+ is worth 5-7x more than a dollar of ARR growing 4%. PagerDuty was once a rocketship. At IPO in 2019, they had 139% NRR — truly elite expansion. In 2022, it was still 124-126%. Customers were landing and expanding aggressively. Today? 100% NRR. That single metric tells the whole story. At 100% NRR: Here’s what the metrics trajectory looks like: When your NRR drops from 130%+ to 100%, your growth engine fundamentally breaks. You go from a flywheel to a treadmill. PagerDuty has had roughly 15,000-16,000 paid customers for three years. Essentially flat. Yes, they’ve grown the number of $100K+ customers from 825 to 867. That’s good! But it’s only 5% growth. And the overall customer base isn’t expanding. When your customer count goes flat, it means one of two things: Either way, it signals that finding new customers has gotten very, very hard. Here’s what founders sometimes miss: Profitability is necessary but not sufficient. PagerDuty made all the “right” moves for the 2022-2024 efficiency era: The market shrugged. Why? Because investors aren’t just buying today’s profits — they’re buying future cash flows. And if your ARR is only growing 4%, your future cash flows are capped. The valuation math: The premium multiples go to companies that can compound. 20%+ growth with strong unit economics gets 8-12x ARR. 30%+ gets you 12-18x. 40%+ and you’re looking at 20x+. PagerDuty’s 4% growth puts them in a different category entirely. In July 2025, Reuters reported that PagerDuty is exploring a sale with Qatalyst Partners. This is actually the second time they’ve explored selling — a similar effort in late 2023 didn’t produce an acceptable offer. This tells you everything about where the board’s head is at: The good news? At 2-3x ARR, PagerDuty is actually cheap for what it is. A strategic buyer who could cut costs further, or bundle it with other products, might pay 3-4x+ ARR. That’s a 30-50% premium from here. But for a company that once traded at 15-20x ARR? That’s a painful outcome for long-term shareholders. Here’s what makes PagerDuty’s situation even harder: the competitive landscape has fundamentally shifted against them. Attack from Above: The Platform Giants Are Bundling The biggest threat isn’t another startup — it’s the observability platforms bundling incident management into their offerings. In June 2024, Datadog launched Datadog On-Call, bringing paging and incident management directly into their observability platform. Their pitch is devastating for PagerDuty: why switch between tools when you can have monitoring AND on-call in one platform with shared context? As one analyst noted, Datadog’s On-Call “could directly challenge PagerDuty and Atlassian Opsgenie” by reducing context switching for IT ops teams. ServiceNow is another threat — they generate more than 20x PagerDuty’s revenue and are expected to grow at 21% CAGR. For large enterprises already in the ServiceNow ecosystem for ITSM, adding incident management is a checkbox, not a new vendor decision. Cisco acquired Splunk. Atlassian has OpsGenie. The platform consolidation trend is real, and standalone point solutions like PagerDuty are caught in the squeeze. Attack from Below: Hungry Startups Eating Their Lunch Meanwhile, a new wave of Slack-native incident management startups has emerged: These startups are purpose-built for modern engineering teams. They’re Slack-native (where engineers actually live), more affordable, and laser-focused on the incident response workflow. As one industry survey noted, “PagerDuty and OpsGenie remain the most-used solutions, but young startups like incident.io, Rootly, and FireHydrant are challenging them.” The startups explicitly position against PagerDuty’s complexity and cost. Rootly’s marketing literally says “Migrate from PagerDuty faster than you can write fair pricing.” The Market Has Changed When PagerDuty went public in 2019, they were the clear category leader with 139% NRR. The “incident management” category was theirs. But the market fragmented: PagerDuty tried to expand into AIOps, automation, and business operations to grow the TAM. But as one analyst observed, they “operate in a crowded market filled with bigger competitors like Cisco’s Splunk and ServiceNow.” The result? A category leader that’s being squeezed from above by bundlers and from below by insurgents — while the core market matures. PagerDuty pioneered on-call incident management. They defined the category. And they won it. But here’s the problem: Categories have natural sizes. The “core” incident management market isn’t infinite. Most companies that need sophisticated on-call rotation and alerting already have a solution. PagerDuty got most of the big ones. They tried to expand the TAM with: But these adjacencies haven’t moved the needle enough. The $36B TAM they cite in investor decks isn’t converting to $36B of real demand for PagerDuty specifically. When you dominate a category but the category stops growing, you have three options: 1. NRR is destiny. When NRR drops below 110%, alarm bells should go off. Below 100%, you’re in serious trouble. Monitor this metric religiously. 2. Customer count growth matters. Flat customer counts for 3 years isn’t a plateau — it’s a warning sign that your market may be saturated or your GTM motion is broken. 3. Profitability buys you time, not valuation. Getting to profitability is essential for survival. But don’t expect the market to reward efficiency alone. You still need growth. 4. Category size is a ceiling. If you’re dominating a $500M category, you’re going to be a ~$500M ARR company. Expanding the category is possible but brutally hard. 5. The “rule of 40” isn’t a multiple accelerator at low growth. 4% growth + 28% margins = 32, which is below 40. But even if it were above 40, a 4% grower trades very differently than a 30% grower with similar efficiency. PagerDuty built a great product. They serve real customers with real pain. They’re profitable and have a fortress balance sheet. And the market values them at 2-3x ARR because growth has stalled. This is the new reality of B2B and SaaS. Profitability is table stakes now. Efficiency is expected. What commands premium multiples is durable growth. If you can’t grow, you can still build a great business. But you won’t build a great stock. And you may end up selling for far less than you once dreamed. Profitable is not enough. You have to grow. Digging into PagerDuty’s Q3 FY26 investor presentation reveals a few more fascinating data points: 1. The Quarter-by-Quarter NRR Collapse is Stark The presentation shows the sequential decline in painful detail: Five straight quarters of decline. That’s not noise — that’s a trend. And it’s not bottoming out; it’s hitting the floor. 2. They Slashed Sales & Marketing from 53% to 30% of Revenue This is the real story behind the margin expansion. In FY20, PagerDuty spent 53% of revenue on sales and marketing. Today? Just 30%. That’s 23 percentage points cut from GTM investment. Yes, it helped margins. But it also helps explain why growth collapsed. You can’t cut your way to growth. 3. R&D Spend Dropped from 26% to 16% Similarly, R&D went from 26% of revenue in FY20 to just 16% today. When you’re being attacked by nimble startups and platform giants, cutting R&D by 10 points feels dangerous. PagerDuty is leaner, but is it still innovating fast enough? 4. They Claim a $50B TAM with Only ~1% Penetration The investor deck cites 87 million potential users across developers (30M), infrastructure ops (23M), customer service (28M), and SecOps (6M) — and claims only ~1% penetration. If true, that’s massive upside. But if you’re only penetrating 1% of a $50B market after 15 years and you’re growing 5%… something doesn’t add up. Either the TAM is overstated or the go-to-market isn’t working. 5. They’ve Tried to Buy Growth — Rundeck (2020), Catalytic (2022), Jeli (2023) The innovation timeline reveals a string of acquisitions: Rundeck for automation in 2020, Catalytic for no-code workflows in 2022, and Jeli for post-incident learning in 2023. These were bets on expanding beyond core incident management. But three years later, growth is still stalling. Acquisitions alone can’t fix a slowing core business — they have to be integrated and monetized. The jury is still out.

More post-Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday fell on Dec. 1 this year, which means it’s officially over, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still deals to be found. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales went live across the biggest retailers. Now that the day is done and dusted, remaining deals are starting to run dry, so time is running out to shop. Almost all major retailers offered discounts for Cyber Monday, including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as specialized retailers like B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can run out of stock quickly, so online shopping often gives you the best shot at grabbing what’s left. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and some extended them into Cyber Monday. While the official event is over, a handful of last‑minute bargains are still live today, but they won’t last much longer. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We've rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll continue to highlight the best lingering deals throughout this extended sale period. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive, the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

Title: Advisors Are Watching These Tax Law Changes in 2026

New tax laws including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act present novel risks and opportunities when filing next year’s tax returns. Jeff Benjamin Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside The holiday season is full of traditions: travel, turkey and occasionally too much eggnog. But for advisors, there’s another (arguably less fun) annual ritual: year-end tax management. Even with about a month left in the calendar year, financial advisors say there are plenty of ways clients can and should prepare for the end of 2025 and the start of 2026. From new guidelines and tax laws related to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law in July, to standard tax-loss harvesting strategies, advisors say there is a lot to focus on during the final weeks of the year. “There are some new limitations … going into effect in 2026, which should be considered carefully before yearend,” said Kathy Buchs, Senior Tax Advisor at MAI Capital Management. The One Big Beautiful Bill, which comprehensively reshaped tax legislation and government spending, “created some additional complexities surrounding itemized deductions for 2025 and 2026,” Buchs said. For example, the law reduced deductible charitable contributions by 0.5% of adjusted gross income and reduced the charitable deduction of high-income taxpayers to 35 cents of tax benefit per dollar donated from 37 cents. “Because of these limitations, which go into effect in 2026, many clients are choosing to accelerate their charitable contributions into 2025 to fully benefit from their charitable giving,” Buchs said. “Many of them are also utilizing donor-advised funds to preserve flexibility for future grant-making.” Donor-advised funds act like a personal tax-advantaged investment account dedicated to supporting qualified charities. Patrick Sabol, Senior Lead Planner at Facet, describes charitable contributions as one of the most effective ways to reduce your tax liability. “You can do this by donating cash or appreciated securities directly to your charity of choice or potentially by using a Donor-Advised Fund,” he added. Sabol said one area that can sometimes be overlooked when focusing on more sophisticated strategies is simply maxing out contributions to pre-tax 401(k) and Health Savings Account plans. While charitable deductions will be capped starting next year at a 35% rate, taxpayers are getting some new relief in the area of state and local tax deductions, commonly referred to as SALT. In 2024, the SALT deduction was capped at $10,000, but that has been increased to $40,000 for the tax years 2025 through 2029. The full $40,000 deduction starts phasing out at modified adjusted gross incomes of $500,000 for joint filers, and the SALT deduction drops back to $10,000 when adjusted gross income reaches $600,000, according to John Patterson, Wealth Management Advisor at OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “When it comes to year-end planning, there are several key dos and don’ts to keep in mind,” Patterson said. “Any charitable gifts should be finalized before December 31, and if your income has changed significantly this year, review your withholding or make estimated payments now to prevent penalties or surprises at tax time.” Other tax deductions introduced in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act include up to $12,500 for qualified overtime pay, up to $6,000 for those 65 and older even if they are taking the standard deduction, and up to $10,000 for interest paid on auto loans for qualified vehicles purchased in 2025. Gabriel Shahin, founder and chief executive of Falcon Wealth, said tax-loss harvesting is among the areas he never overlooks this time of year. “Those losses should be used to offset your ordinary income, not just your capital gains,” he said. “Selling gains to offset losses defeats the whole point of tax-loss harvesting.” Shahin said one mistake he sometimes sees is investors ignoring their taxable brokerage accounts. “That’s where you’re getting hit with taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains,” he explained. “With strategic withdrawals and coordinated Roth contributions, you can shift money into tax-free growth instead of bleeding taxes every year for no reason.” Lance Elrod, co-owner of Next Step Financial Transitions, said tax-loss harvesting should be a focus throughout the year, but always revisited at yearend. “In years like 2025, when there has been strong market performance, especially in certain sectors like tech and international stocks, it’s worth revisiting your overall allocation to make sure you haven’t drifted too far away from where you want your allocation to be,” he said. Feeling Crypto. With a growing focus on cryptocurrency investing, Elrod said that can also be a good place to find tax management opportunities. “The crypto space has had a rough two-month stretch and if you purchased any cryptocurrencies recently, you are likely at a loss,” he said. “Since cryptocurrencies are seen as property in the US, you do not have to worry about the wash-sale rule like you would for other investments.” In essence, Elrod explained, “if you feel strongly about your crypto position, you can sell today to capture the loss for tax purposes and repurchase the same position five minutes later and not have to worry about the sale being disallowed for tax purposes.” Make It a Roth. Virtually across the board, advisors say consideration should be given to Roth conversions. “Failing to factor in potential tax-bracket shifts may also cause you to miss valuable opportunities for Roth conversions,” said Patterson of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “Consider Roth conversions to lock in future tax-free growth, but carefully manage conversion amounts to avoid tax-bracket creep,” he added. Sabol of Facet said a Roth conversion is not necessarily a tax minimization strategy in the short term, but it can be a major year-end opportunity that is often overlooked. “Towards the end of the year, we can better estimate what tax bracket we will end up in,” he added. “This is a great time to maximize the lower brackets and fill them up with a conversion if available.” Shahin of Falcon Wealth described Roth conversions as one of the best tools for people in their 70s. “You’re essentially prepaying taxes at today’s lower rates to avoid massive required minimum distributions later when rates go up,” he said. “With tax brackets scheduled to increase in 2026 and SALT relief expiring, real tax planning becomes essential, because you want to shrink that pre-tax balance now, not when your RMDs force the issue.” The world’s largest asset manager is caught in the crossfire between critics who say it’s pushing ESG too aggressively, and those who insist it’s not doing nearly enough. The company, which is still new to the category, sees the case for buffer and defined-outcome ETFs growing as more people near retirement. The CFP Board presented four possible scenarios on how AI will impact wealth managers in the year 2030. The way advisors communicate retirement outcomes can dramatically improve client optimism. PE will continue to dominate, but medium-sized sellers may fill in the gaps. Client risk aversion shifts constantly, and advisors must navigate those changes while technology becomes more prominent in investment management. Financial advisors learn to love the turnkey solutions with customizable options. The most significant benefits went to savers with bigger balances and higher contribution rates. Crypto’s exclusion further highlights the complete 180 Paul Atkins’s SEC has done on multiple issues from the previous administration. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Have you ever wondered how Amazon manages to deliver billions of packages a day across the globe? One center in the UK is already gearing up for the Christmas season, with a highly synchronized operation of moving robots, conveyor belts and storage towers. (AP Video: Mustakim Hasnath) Amazon’s generative AI-powered shopping assistant, Rufus, appears on a computer monitor, Dec. 1, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File) The OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a cell phone in front of an image on a computer screen generated by ChatGPT’s Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, file) NEW YORK (AP) — Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season’s most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock. San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce’s director of consumer insights. The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer’s website, Schwartz said. Despite the advancements, AI’s impact on holiday shopping will be “relatively limited” this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner. “The more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,” Jashinsky said. “But customer behavior takes a long time to change.” Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025: AI’s potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks. OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers’ guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user’s previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for “detail-heavy” items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said. Then there’s Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user’s browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations. Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans, Responses are pulled from Google’s 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed. “This is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,” Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Walmart’s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target’s app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient. Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal’s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops. This holiday season, shoppers have new options. Amazon launched a 90-day pricing history tracker this month for virtually everything it sells. Shoppers also now can set up alerts to receive notifications when prices on specific items fall within their budgets. Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment’s size and color. Microsoft’s Copilot also launched a price tracker this year. Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive. “A lot of consumers that weren’t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,” Goldberg predicted. Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer’s website to complete a purchase. OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx. OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart’s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time. A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app. New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, “agentic AI” is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say. Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an “auto buy” button while setting up price alerts. Once a product’s price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said. The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn’t carry a desired item in its store, a “Shop Direct” button will take them to the website of a place that does. Google’s AI Mode price tracker also includes a “buy for me” option that automatically makes a customer’s purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers. Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google’s program discloses to the store that it’s an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said. Google said it’s applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: Google’s surge shows how quickly AI narratives turn

Google is winning the AI race – isn’t it? Recent headlines – “Why Google is winning the AI race”, “5 reasons Google has never looked stronger”, “Google is suddenly beating its magnificent seven peers in the AI race” – suggest as much. So does the share price of Google parent Alphabet: the stock is now up some 70 per cent this year, more than twice as big as Nvidia’s gains. Indeed, Alphabet’s market capitalisation recently came within touching distance of $4 trillion (€3.45 trillion), not far behind Nvidia and Apple. Google’s reputation has shifted from playing catch-up in AI to the possibility that it’s now setting the pace. How quickly market narratives can change. In July, Nvidia was worth almost twice as much as Alphabet, which at that point sat below Amazon in the rankings and only narrowly ahead of Facebook parent Meta. Just last month, Nvidia was valued at $5 trillion, $2 trillion more than Alphabet. By late November, the gap had shrunk to “just” $300 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s near doubling over the last six months means it’s now worth more than twice as much as Meta. We see a similar dynamic with Apple. A year ago, it was the most valuable firm in the world and was the heavy favourite to become the world’s first $4 trillion company. The narrative changed abruptly; dismissed as an AI laggard, it was overtaken by Microsoft and then swept aside by Nvidia’s surge. [ No matter what AI tells today’s nostalgic teens, life in the 1990s wasn’t all betterOpens in new window ] Now the pendulum has swung again, with Apple recently climbing back to the point where it was within reach of Nvidia’s valuation. What looked like timidity and under-investment in AI now reads like capital discipline – for now anyway. Even with trillion-dollar stocks, stories matter as much as spreadsheets, and stories change all the time. Forecasts about who is ‘winning’ the AI race tend to age poorly.

Title: Google TPUv7: “perf per TCO advantage of TPUs is so strong that you already get the gains from adopting TPUs even before turning one on”

The two best models in the world, Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 Opus and Google’s Gemini 3 have the majority of their training and inference infrastructure on Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium. Now Google is selling TPUs physically to multiple firms. Is this the end of Nvidia’s dominance? The dawn of the AI era is here, and it is crucial to understand that the cost structure of AI-driven software deviates considerably from traditional software. Chip microarchitecture and system architecture play a vital role in the development and scalability of these innovative new forms of software. The hardware infrastructure on which AI software runs has a notably larger impact on Capex and Opex, and subsequently the gross margins, in contrast to earlier generations of software, where developer costs were relatively larger. Consequently, it is even more crucial to devote considerable attention to optimizing your AI infrastructure to be able to deploy AI software. Firms that have an advantage in infrastructure will also have an advantage in the ability to deploy and scale applications with AI. Google had peddled the idea of building AI-specific infrastructure as far back as 2006, but the problem came to a boiling point in 2013. They realized they needed to double the number of datacenters they had if they wanted to deploy AI at any scale. As such, they started laying the groundwork for their TPU chips which were put into production in 2016. It’s interesting to compare this to Amazon, who in the same year, realized they needed to build custom silicon too. In 2013, they started the Nitro Program, which was focused on developing silicon to optimize general-purpose CPU computing and storage. Two very different companies optimized their efforts for infrastructure for different eras of computing and software paradigms. We’ve long believed that the TPU is among the world’s best systems for AI training and inference, neck and neck with king of the jungle Nvidia. 2.5 years ago we wrote about TPU supremacy, and this thesis has proven to be very correct. TPU’s results speak for themselves: Gemini 3 is one of the best models in the world and was trained entirely on TPUs. In this report, we will talk about the huge changes in Google’s strategy to properly commercialize the TPU for external customers, becoming the newest and most threatening merchant silicon challenger to Nvidia. We plan to: (Re-)Educate our clients and new readers about the rapidly growing commercial success of external TPU customers, starting with Anthropic and extending to Meta, SSI, xAI and even potentially OpenAI... Show that: The more (TPU) you buy, the more (NVIDIA GPU capex) you save! OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPU yet and already increased perf per TCO by getting ~30% off their compute fleet due to competitive threats Explain the circular economy deals for AI Infrastructure. Revisit our original TPU deep dive with a refresher on the TPU hardware stack from silicon down to the software layer. Cover the positive developments on the open software ecosystem front as well as the critical missing ingredient for Google to make the TPU ecosystem a viable challenger to the CUDA moat: open source their XLA:TPU compiler, runtime, and multi-pod “MegaScaler” code. In the paywall, we will discuss the implications for Nvidia’s moat and compare Vera Rubin to the next gen TPUv8AX/8X (aka Sunfish/Zebrafish) Also cover the long term threat to Nvidia. First, let’s talk about the impact this news has had on the ecosystem. TPU performance has clearly caught the attention of its rivals. Sam Altman has acknowledged “rough vibes” ahead for OpenAI as Gemini has stolen the thunder from OpenAI. Nvidia even put out a reassuring PR telling everyone to keep calm and carry on — we are well ahead of the competition. We understand why. These past few months have been win after win for the Google Deepmind, GCP, and TPU complex. The huge upwards revisions to TPU production volumes, Anthropic’s >1GW TPU buildout, SOTA models Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 trained on TPU, and now an expanding list of clients being targeted (Meta, SSI, xAI, OAI) lining up for TPUs. This has driven a huge re-rating of the Google and TPU supply chain at the expense of the Nvidia GPU-focused supply chain. While the “sudden” emergence of Google and the TPU supply chain has caught many by surprise, SemiAnalysis institutional product subscribers have been anticipating this for the last year. Another reason Nvidia has been on the defensive is a growing chorus of skeptics who argue the company is propping up a “circular economy” by funding cash-burning AI startups, essentially moving money from one pocket to another with extra steps. We think this view is misplaced, but it has clearly struck a nerve inside Nvidia. The finance team issued a detailed response, reproduced below. We think a more realistic explanation is that Nvidia aims to protect its dominant position at the foundation labs by offering equity investment rather than cutting prices, which would lower Gross margins and cause widespread investor panic. Below, we outline the OpenAI and Anthropic arrangements to show how frontier labs can lower GPU TCO by buying, or threatening to buy TPUs. OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPUs yet and they’ve already saved ~30% on their entire lab wide NVIDIA fleet. This demonstrates how the perf per TCO advantage of TPUs is so strong that you already get the gains from adopting TPUs even before turning one on. Our Accelerator Industry Model, Datacenter Industry Model and Core Research subscribers saw the industry implications well before this was announced and became market consensus. In early August, we shared with our Accelerator Model clients that we saw massive upward revisions for Broadcom / Google TPU orders in the supply chain for 2026. We also revealed that the reason for these order increases was the fact that Google would begin selling systems externally to multiple customers. In early September, we revealed that one of the big external customers will be Anthropic, with demand of at least 1 million TPUs. This was officially confirmed by Anthropic and Google in October. We also called out Meta as a big TPU customer on the 7th of November, weeks before others. In addition we have discussed other customers as well. As a result, our institutional clients have had plenty of heads up on one of the largest performance dispersions in the AI Trade to date. SemiAnalysis was the first to break all these insights because no other research firm can connect the dots from the fabs to supply chain through the datacenters to the labs. To get access to these insights as and stay ahead of the curve: sales@semianalysis.com Onto the deal. The TPU stack has long rivaled Nvidia’s AI hardware, yet it has mostly supported Google’s internal workloads. In typical Google fashion, it never fully commercialized the TPU even after making it available to GCP customers in 2018. That is starting to change. Over the past few months, Google has mobilized efforts across the whole stack to bring TPUs to external customers through GCP or by selling complete TPU systems as a merchant vendor. The search giant is leveraging its strong in-house silicon design capabilities to become a truly differentiated cloud provider. Furthermore, it aligns with marquis customer Anthropic’s continued push to diversify away from its dependence on NVDA. The Anthropic deal marks a major milestone in this push. We understand that GCP CEO Thomas Kurian played a central role in the negotiations. Google committed early by investing aggressively in Anthropic’s funding rounds, even agreeing to no voting rights and a 15% cap on their ownership to expand the use of TPUs beyond internal Google. This strategy was eased by the presence of former DeepMind TPU talent within the foundation lab, resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs. Google has already built a substantial facility for Anthropic, as shown below as part of our building-by-building tracker of AI labs. Beyond renting capacity in Google datacenters through GCP, Anthropic will deploy TPUs in its own facilities, positioning Google to compete directly with Nvidia as a true merchant hardware vendor. In terms of the split of the 1M TPUs: The first phase of the deal covers 400k TPUv7 Ironwoods, worth ~$10 billion in finished racks that Broadcom will sell directly to Anthropic. Anthropic is the fourth customer referenced in Broadcom’s most recent earnings call. Fluidstack, a gold-rated ClusterMax Neocloud provider, will handle on-site setup, cabling, burn-in, acceptance testing, and remote hands work as Anthropic offloads managing physical servers. DC infrastructure will be supplied by TeraWulf (WULF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR). The remaining 600k TPUv7 units will be rented through GCP in a deal we estimate at $42 billion of RPO, accounting for most of the $49 billion increase in GCP’s backlog reported in the third quarter. We believe additional deals with Meta, OAI, SSI, and xAI could provide additional RPO + direct hardware sales for GCP in coming quarters. Despite heavy internal and external demand, Google has not been able to deploy TPUs at the pace it wants. Even though it has more control over its hardware supply than other hyperscalers that still need curry favor with Jensen, Google’s main bottleneck is power. While other hyperscalers have expanded their own sites and secured significant colocation capacity, Google has moved more slowly. We believe the core issue is contractual and administrative. Each new datacenter vendor requires a Master Services Agreement, and these are multibillion-dollar, multiyear commitments that naturally involve some bureaucracy. Yet Google’s process is especially slow, often taking up to three years from initial discussions to a signed MSA. Google’s workaround carries major implications for Neocloud providers and cryptominers looking to pivot to AI DC infrastructure. Instead of leasing directly, Google offers a credit backstop, an off-balance-sheet “IOU” to step in if Fluidstack cannot pay its datacenter rent. Neoclouds like Fluidstack are nimble and flexible, making it easier for them to deal with new datacenter vendors like reformed cryptominers. This mechanic has been key to our bullish views on the cryptomining industry – notably we were calling out numerous including IREN and Applied Digital at the beginning of the year when stock prices were materially lower. The opportunity for miners rests on a simple dynamic: the datacenter industry faces acute power constraints power, and cryptominers already control capacity through their PPAs and existing electrical infrastructure. We expect many more agreements to follow in the coming weeks and quarters. Prior to the Google/Fluidstack/TeraWulf deal, we had not seen any deal with a mere off-balance-sheet “IOU” in the Neocloud market. After the deal, we believe it has become the new de-facto standard financing template. This solves a key headache for Neoclouds looking to secure datacenter capacity and grow their business: A GPU cluster has a useful and economic life of 4-5years A large datacenter lease is typically 15+ years, with a typical payback period of ~8 years. This duration mismatch has made it very complicated for both Neoclouds and Datacenter vendors to secure financing for projects. But with the rise of the “hyperscaler backstop”, we believe the financing issues are solved. We expect a new wave of growth for the NeoCloud industry. Check out our Accelerator and Datacenter models to understand the key beneficiaries. These are the how’s and why’s behind the Anthropic deal, now let’s get into the hardware. Furthermore, Neoclouds who count Jensen as an investor such as CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, Together, Lambda, Firmus, and Nscale all have a notable incentive to not adopt any competing technology in their datacenter: TPUs, AMD GPUs, or even Arista switches are off limits! This leaves a gaping hole in the market for TPU hosting that is currently filled by a combination of crypto miners + Fluidstack. In the coming months, we expect to see more Neoclouds make the tough decision between pursuing a growing TPU hosting opportunity and securing allocations of the latest and greatest Nvidia Rubin systems. The answer is simple. It is a strong chip inside an excellent system, and that combination offers compelling performance and TCO for Anthropic. 2.5 years ago, we wrote about Google’s compute infrastructure advantage. Even with silicon that lagged Nvidia’s on paper, Google’s system-level engineering allowed the TPU stack to match Nvidia in both performance and cost efficiency. We argued then that “systems matter more than microarchitecture,” and the past two years have reinforced that view. Anthropic’s massive TPU orders are a direct validation of the platform’s technical strength. The GPU ecosystem has shifted forward as well. Nvidia’s GB200 represents a major leap forward, pushing Nvidia toward becoming a true systems company that designs full servers rather than only the chip package inside. While we are on the topic of the GB200’s huge innovation in rack-scale interconnect, one underappreciated point is that Google has been scaling up TPUs within and across racks since TPU v2 back in 2017! Further down in the report, we feature a deep dive on Google’s ICI scale-up networking, the only real rival to Nvidia’s NVLink. Google’s recent Gemini 3 model is now viewed as the state of the art frontier LLM. Like all earlier versions of Gemini, it was trained entirely on TPUs. That result offers concrete proof of both TPU capability and Google’s broader infrastructure advantage. Today’s attention often centers on hardware for inference and post-training, yet pre-training a frontier model remains the hardest and most resource-intensive challenge in AI hardware. The TPU platform has passed that test decisively. This stands in sharp contrast to rivals: OpenAI’s leading researchers have not completed a successful full-scale pre-training run that was broadly deployed for a new frontier model since GPT-4o in May 2024, highlighting the significant technical hurdle that Google’s TPU fleet has managed to overcome. One of the key highlights of the new model include noticeable gains in tool calling and agentic capability, especially on longer-horizon tasks for economically valuable tasks. Vending Bench is an evaluation that aims to measure how well models would run a business over a long period of time by placing them as the owner of a simulated vending machine business and Gemini 3 destroyed the competition. This launch brought not just improved capabilities but new products. Antigravity, a product born from the acqui-hire of former Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan and team, is Google’s answer to OpenAI’s Codex, officially entering Gemini into the vibe coding token guzzling wars. For Google to quietly muscle in and establish a performance lead in one of the most challenging hardware problems is a truly impressive feat for a company whose core business isn’t, or should we say, wasn’t in hardware business. The corollary to “Systems matter more than Microarchitecture”, is that while Google has been pushing the boundary on system and networking design, TPU silicon itself wasn’t too ground-breaking. Since then, TPU silicon has made massive strides with the latest generations. From the outset, Google’s design philosophy has been more conservative on silicon relative to Nvidia. Historically, TPUs have shipped with significantly fewer peak theoretical FLOPs, and lower memory specs than corresponding Nvidia GPUs. There are 3 reasons for this. First, Google places a high internal emphasis on ‘RAS’ (Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) for their infrastructure. Google prefers to sacrifice absolute performance in exchange for greater hardware uptime. Running things to the limit means higher instances of hardware mortality which has a real TCO impact in terms of system downtime and hot spares. After all, the hardware you cannot use has infinite TCO relative to performance. The second reason is that up until 2023, Google’s primary AI workload was recommendation system models to power their core Search and Ad properties. RecSys workloads carry much lower arithmetic intensity compared to LLM workloads which means fewer FLOPs are required relative to every bit of data that is transferred. The third comes down to the utility of “peak theoretical FLOPs” numbers that are marketed and how they can be manipulated. Merchant GPU providers like Nvidia and AMD want to market the best performance specifications possible for their chips. This incentivizes them to stretch marketed FLOPs to the highest number possible. In practice, these numbers are unable to be sustained. On the other hand, the TPU has primarily been internal facing, with much less pressure to inflate these specifications externally. This has important implications that we’ll discuss further. The generous way to look at it would be Nvidia is better at DVFS therefore happy to report peak specs only. After we ushered in the LLM era, there has been a clear shift in Google’s TPU design philosophy. We can see that with the 2 most recent TPU generations that were designed-post LLM: TPUv6 Trillium (Ghostlite) and TPUv7 Ironwood (Ghostfish) reflect that change. We can see in the chart below that for TPUv4 and v5, compute throughput was much lower than the Nvidia flagship at the time. TPUv6 came very close to the H100/H200 on FLOPs, but it came 2 years later than the H100. With TPU v7, the gap narrows further with servers available only a few quarters later, while delivering almost the same level of peak theoretical FLOPs. What drove these performance gains? Partially it’s that Google started announcing TPUs as they ramp into production rather then after the next generation was being deployed. Furthermore, TPU v6 Trillium is manufactured on the same N5 node as TPU v5p with similar silicon area but was able to deliver a whopping 2x increase in peak theoretical FLOPs with significantly less power! For Trillium, Google quadrupled the size of each systolic array to 256 x 256 tiles from 128 x 128, and this increase in array size is what has delivered the increase in compute. Trillium was also the last of the “E” (lite) SKUs which meant it was equipped with only 2 sites of HBM3. While Trillium closed the gap to Hopper on compute, it fell far short of the H100/H200 on memory capacity and bandwidth, with only 2 stacks of HBM3 vs 5 and 6 stacks of HBM3 and HBM3E respectively. This made it painful to use for novices, but the performance TCO achieved for Trillium is unbeatable if you get shard your model properly and utilize all those cheap FLOPS. TPU v7 Ironwood is the next iteration where Google nearly completely closes the gap to the corresponding Nvidia flagship GPU on FLOPs, memory, and bandwidth albeit with general availability 1 year later than Blackwell. Compared to the GB200, FLOPs and memory bandwidth only have a slight shortfall, with capacity being the same with 8-Hi HBM3E, which is of course a significant shortfall to GB300 which has 288GB of 12-Hi HBM3E. Theoretical absolute performance is one thing but what matters is real world performance per Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While Google procures TPUs through Broadcom and pays a hefty margin, it is significantly less than the margin Nvidia earns on not only the GPUs they sell but entire the whole system including CPUs, Switches, NICs, system memory, cabling and connectors. From Google’s perspective this results in the all-in TCO per Ironwood chip for the full 3D Torus configuration being ~44% lower than the TCO of a GB200 server. This more than makes up for the ~10% shortfall on peak FLOPs and peak memory bandwidth. This is from the perspective of Google and the price they procure TPU servers at. What about Google’s external customers when Google adds their margin on top? We assume that in the case where Google earns a margin on leasing TPU 7 to external customers that the TCO per hour can still be up to ~30% lower than the cost of the GB200 and ~41% lower than the cost of the GB300. This is what we believe is reflective of Anthropic’s pricing via GCP. Comparing theoretical FLOPs tells only part of the story. What matters is effective FLOPs, since peak numbers are almost never reached in real-world workloads. In practice, Nvidia GPUs typically achieve only about a small portion of their theoretical peak once communication overhead, memory stalls, power limits, and other system effects are factored in. A good rule of thumb for training is 30%, but utilization also varies heavily by workload. A large share of the gap comes down to software and compiler efficiency. Nvidia’s advantage here stems from the CUDA moat and the wide set of open source libraries that come out of the box, helping workloads run efficiently with high realized FLOPs and memory bandwidth. The TPU software stack is not as easy to use, though this is beginning to change. Inside Google, TPUs benefit from excellent internal tooling that is not exposed to external customers, which makes out of the box performance weaker. However, this only applies to small and/or lazy users, and Anthropic is neither of those. Anthropic has strong engineering resources and ex-Google compiler experts who know both the TPU stack and understand their own model architecture well. They can invest in custom kernels to drive high TPU efficiency. As a result, they can reach substantially higher MFU and much better $/PFLOP performance. We believe that despite lower marketed peak FLOPs, TPUs can reach higher realized Model FLOP Utilization (MFU) than Blackwell, which translates into higher effective FLOPs for Ironwood. A major reason is that marketed GPU FLOPs from Nvidia and AMD are significantly inflated. Even in tests designed to maximize throughput through GEMMs shaped far from real workloads, Hopper only reached about ~80% of peak, Blackwell landed in the 70s, and AMD’s MI300 series in the 50s-60s. The limiting factor is power delivery. These chips cannot sustain the clock speeds used in the peak math. Nvidia and AMD implement Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling which means that the chip’s clock frequency is dynamically adjusted based on power consumption and thermals rather than a stable clock frequency that can actually be sustained. Nvidia and AMD then select the highest clock frequency that could possibly be delivered, even if very intermittently, to be used in the calculation of peak theoretical FLOPs (operations per cycle per ALU x number of ALUs x cycles per second i.e. clock frequency). There are other tricks that are employed, like running GEMMs on tensors filled with zeroes, as 0x0=0, the transistors don’t need to switch state from 0 to 1, therefore reducing the power draw of each operation. Of course, in the real world, zero-filled tensors are not multiplied together. When we put together much lower TCO and higher effective FLOPs utilization, from the perspective of Google the $ per effective FLOP becomes much cheaper, with ~15% MFU being the breakeven with GB300 at 30% MFU. This means if Google (or Anthropic) manages to hit half the FLOPs utilization of GB300, they still come out even. Of course, with Google’s elite compiler engineer team and deep understanding of their own models, the MFU they can realize on TPUs could be 40% potentially. That would be a whopping ~62% reduction in cost per effective training FLOP! However, when looking at the 600K rented TPUs, when we incorporate the higher TCO that Anthropic pays (ie inclusive of Google’s margin stacking) into this analysis, we estimate the cost to Anthropic to be $1.60 per TPU-hour from GCP, narrowing the TCO advantage. We believe that Anthropic can realize 40% MFU on TPUs due to both their focus on performance optimization as well as the TPU’s marketed FLOPs inherently being more realistic. This provides Anthropic with a staggering ~52% lower TCO per effective PFLOP compared to GB300 NVL72. The equilibrium where TCO per effective FLOP compared to the GB300 baseline is the same is at a much lower 19% extracted MFU for Anthropic. This means that Anthropic can suffer a sizeable performance shortfall relative to the baseline GB300 and the perf/TCO for training FLOPs still ends up being the same as the baseline Nvidia system. FLOPs are not the end all and be all for performance, memory bandwidth is super important for inference, especially on the bandwidth intensive decode step. It should be no surprise that $ per memory bandwidth for the TPU also ends up being much cheaper than GB300. There is significant evidence that at small message sizes such as 16MB to 64MB (loading an expert of a single layer), TPU’s even achieve higher memory bandwidth utilization then GPUs. All of this translates into more efficient compute to train and serve a model. Anthropic’s release of Opus 4.5 continued the usual focus on coding, setting a new SWE-Bench record. The main surprise was a ~67% price cut on the API. This price cut paired with the lower verbosity and higher token efficiency of the model compared to Sonnet (76% fewer tokens to match Sonnet’s best score, and 45% fewer to exceed it by 4 points) means Opus 4.5 is the best model for coding use cases and could effectively raise Anthropic’s realized token pricing as Sonnet is over 90% of token mix today. When it comes to pricing for external customers, Google needs to thread the needle to balance their own profitability whilst offering customers a competitive proposition. Our estimate for Anthropic pricing is on the lower end of ranges we’ve heard for external pricing. For a flagship customer such as Anthropic, who will provide valuable input into both the software and hardware roadmap whilst ordering a huge amount of volumes, we’d expect sweetheart pricing. While Nvidia’s eye-watering 4x markup (~75% gross margin) offers a lot of room for pricing flexibility, a good amount of oxygen is sucked away by Broadcom. Broadcom, as the TPU’s co-designer, earns a high margin on the silicon which is the largest component of system BOM. Still, this leaves a lot of room for Google to earn very good acceptable margins. We can see this from comparing the GCP Anthropic deal to other large GPU-based cloud deals. Note that this is looking at the 600k TPUs that is being rented with the remaining 400k TPU v7 chips being bought upfront by Anthropic. Under these assumptions, the TPU v7 economics show superior EBIT margins than the other large GPU-based cloud deals we have observed, with only OCI-OpenAI coming close. Even with Broadcom’s margin stack on the chip-level BOM, Google can still eke out far superior margins and returns than much more commoditized GPU deals. This is where the TPU stack allows GCP to be a truly differentiated CSP. Meanwhile someone like Microsoft Azure, whose ASIC program is struggling, is confined to earning more mediocre returns in the mere business of leasing merchant hardware. We’ve so far discussed how TPUs compare to Nvidia GPUs, focusing on per chip specs and the shortcomings. Now, let’s get back to the system discussion which is where TPU’s capabilities really start to diverge. One of the most distinctive features of the TPU is its extremely large scale up world size through the ICI protocol. The world size of a TPU pod reaches 9216 Ironwood TPUs, with large pod sizes being a feature of TPUs as early as TPUv2 back in 2017 scaling up to a full 256 1024-chip cluster size. Let’s start at the rack level, the basic building block of each TPU superpod. The TPU rack has a similar design over the last couple of generations. Each rack consists of 16 TPU Trays, 16 or 8 Host CPU Trays depending on the cooling configuration, a ToR Switch, power supply units, and BBUs. Each TPU tray consists of 1 TPU board with 4 TPU chip packages mounted. Each Ironwood TPU will have 4 OSFP cages for ICI connections and 1 CDFP PCIe cage for the connection to the Host CPU. Google has been implementing liquid cooled TPU racks since TPU v3 in 2018, but there are still some TPU generations in between that were designed to be air-cooled. The main difference between the liquid cooled and the air-cooled rack is that the air-cooled rack has 2 TPU trays to 1 host CPU tray ratio while the liquid cooled rack has a 1 to 1 ratio instead. An innovative design of TPU’s liquid cooling is that the flow rate of the coolant is actively controlled by the valves. This enables much more efficient cooling as the flow can be adjusted depending on the amount of workload that each chip has at any given time. Google’s TPU has also long adopted vertical power delivery, in which the VRM modules of the TPUs are on the other side of the PCB board. These VRM modules also require a cold plate for cooling. Overall, the TPU rack design is much simpler than that of the Nvidia Oberon NVL72 design, which has a much higher density and utilizes a backplane to connect GPUs to scale up switches. The scale up connections between the TPU trays are all over external copper cables or optics, which will be explained in the ICI section below. The connection between the TPU tray and the CPU tray is also over PCIe DAC cable. The building block of Google’s ICI scale-up network for TPUv7 is a 4x4x4 3D torus consisting of 64 TPUs. Each 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs maps to one physical rack of 64 TPUs. This is an ideal dimension as all 64 TPUs can be connected electrically to each other and still fit in a physical rack. The TPUs are connected to each other in a 3D torus configuration, with each TPU connecting to 6 neighbors total – 2 logically adjacent neighboring TPUs for each of the X, Y and Z axes. Each TPU is always connected to 2 other TPUs via PCB traces within the compute tray but depending on where the TPU is located within the 4x4x4 cube, it will connect to 4 other neighbors either via Direct Attach Copper (DAC) cables or via an Optical Transceiver. Connections within the interior of the 4x4x4 cube happen over copper, while connections outside of the 4x4x4 cube (including wrap-around connections back to the other side of the cube as well as connections to neighboring 4x4x4 cubes) will use optical transceivers and OCSs. In the below diagram, we see that as this is a 3D Torus network: TPU 2,3,4 (on the Z+ face) has a wraparound connection back to the opposite Z-axis face to TPU 2,3,1 (on the Z- face) using an 800G optical transceiver and routing through an OCS. As mentioned above, in addition to the 2 neighboring TPUs that are always connected via PCB traces, TPUs will connect to 4 other neighbors using DACs, transceivers or a mix of both depending on where in the 4x4x4 cube they are. TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube will connect to the 4 other neighbors exclusively using DACs, TPUs on the face of the cube will connect via 3 DACs and 1 optical transceiver, TPUs on the edge of the cube will connect via 2 optical transceivers and 2 DACs, while TPUs on the corners will connect via 1 DAC and 3 optical transceivers. You can remember how many transceivers a given TPU will use by looking at how many of the TPU’s sides are facing the “outside” of the cube. The diagram above, as well as the table below, summarizes the number of respective location types for TPUs and can be used to derive the attach ratio of 1.5 Optical Transceivers per TPU v7. These transceivers connect to Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs) which enable connections between 4x4x4 cubes – more on that in the next section. Google adopts a software-defined networking approach to manage network routes through Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs). An NxN OCS is basically a massive train station with N tracks in and N tracks out. Any train coming in can be transferred to any train coming out, but this has to be reconfigured at the station. Trains cannot be “looped back” or sent back on another N track in, they must be routed only to one of the N tracks out. The benefit of this approach is that the network can assemble smaller logical TPU slices – for different workloads from the theoretical maximum of 9,216 chips in the ICI network layer. By rerouting ICI paths around faults in the network through slicing a larger cluster, cluster availability improves. Unlike Electronic Packet Switching (EPS) switches such as an Arista Tomahawk 5 where there is a fixed total bandwidth that is further split into several ports of smaller bandwidth sizes, OCSs allow any bandwidth of optical fiber to be connected to its ports. OCSs is also low latency compared to EPSs because optical signals entering an OCS simply bounce from the input port to the output port. For EPSs, optical signals must be converted to electrical signals when entering the switch – one key reason why an OCS is typically more power efficient than an EPS. An EPS also allows routing of packets from any port to any port, while an OCS only allows you to route an “in” port to any other “out” port only. OCS ports only route individual fiber strands. This becomes a challenge for standard duplex transceivers because bandwidth is transmitted over multiple fiber strands, which reduces the effective radix and bandwidth of the OCS. To solve this problem, an FR optical transceiver is used to consolidate all wavelengths onto a single fiber strand to be connected to 1 OCS port. The Apollo Project innovatively achieved this in two steps. First, the 8 wavelengths – 1 wavelength for each 100G lane – are multiplexed through Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM8) to transmit 800G over a single fiber pair, instead of 8 fiber pairs. Second, an optical circulator is integrated on the wave division multiplexing (WDM) transceiver to enable full duplex data flow, reducing requirements from 1 fiber pair to only 1 fiber strand. The circulator forms a bi-directional link by combining the Tx and Rx fiber strands at the transceiver onto a single fiber strand that is sent to the OCS switch. Google’s ICI scale-up network is unique in that it allows the connection of multiple 64 TPU 4x4x4 Cubes together in a 3D torus configuration to create massive world sizes. The TPUv7 has a stated maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs but today, Google supports the configuration of TPUs into multiple different slice sizes of between 4 TPUs all the way up to 2,048 TPUs. While Google can innovatively achieve an impressive scale-up cluster of 9,216 TPUs, the benefit of running training workloads on incrementally larger block sizes of up to approximately 8,000 TPUs at any point in time decreases. This is because larger block sizes are more prone to failures and disruption, therefore decreasing slice availability, which is defined by the fraction of time in which the ICI cluster is able to form a contiguous 3D torus slice. For slices that can fit entirely within a 4x4x4 Cube, we can simply carve these slices out of that cube using the copper interconnects within the rack as well as the optical transceivers on the face/edge/corner of the cube to wrap around and complete the 3D Torus if needed.To see how wraparound and inter-cube connections are made, let’s start by looking at how we would create a 64 TPU slice in a 4x4x4 topography. We can use the unit 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs corresponding to one physical 64 TPU rack to build up this topography. All 8 TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube can fully connect to all 6 neighbors using copper. If a TPU does not have an interior neighbor along a given axis, it will wrap around and connect to a TPU on the opposite side of the cube. For example, TPU 4,1,4 has no interior neighbor in the Z+ direction, so it will use one 800G optical transceiver to connect to an OCS assigned to the Z-axis, with the OCS configured to direct this connection to the Z- side of the cube, connecting to TPU 4,1,1. In the Y- direction, TPU 1,1,1 will use an optical transceiver to connect to a Y-axis OCS to link to the Y+ side of TPU 1,4,1 and so on. Each face of the 4x4x4 cube will connect via 16 different OCSs – one OCS for each TPU on each face. For example, in the diagram below, on the X+ face, TPU 4,3,2 connects to the input side of OCS X,3,2. OCS X,3,2’s input side will also connect to the same TPU Index (4,3,2) on the X+ face of all 144 4x4x4 Cubes in the 9,216 TPU cluster. OCS X,3,2’s output side will then connect to the same TPU Index for every single cube in the cluster except this time on the X- face – so it will connect to TPU 1,3,2 on all 144 cubes of the cluster. The diagram below illustrates how all 16 TPUs on the X+ face of Cube A connect via 16 OCSs to 16 TPUs on the X- of Cube B. These connections allow any “+” face of any cube to connect to the “-“ face of any other cube, enabling complete fungibility of cubes when forming slices. There are two constraints to briefly point out. First, TPUs of one Index on a given face can never connect directly to a different index – so TPU 4,3,2 could never be configured to connect to TPU 1,2,3. Second, as the OCS essentially acts as a patch panel – TPUs connected on the input side cannot “loop back” to connect to any other TPU that is also connected on the input side of the OCS - as an example, TPU 4,3,2 can never connect to TPU 4,3,3. So – any TPU on the “+” face can never connect to the “+” face of any other cube, and any TPU on the “-” face can never connect to the “-” face of any other cube. Let’s go larger and see how a 4x4x8 Topography could be set up. In this configuration, we extend the slice by connecting two 64 TPU 4x4x4 cubes along the Z-axis. In this case, the OCS will reconfigure the optical port that TPU 4,1,4 is connected to so that it now connects to TPU 4,1,5 instead of wrapping around back to TPU 4,1,1 as was the case for a standalone 4x4x4 topography. Extending this, we will have 16 optical connections extending from the Z- and Z+ faces of each of the two 4x4x4 TPU cubes, for a total of 64 Fiber strands connected into 16 Z-Axis OCSs. It is important to remind readers that Cube A and Cube B depicted below are not necessarily physically located next to each other. Instead, they are connected via OCSs and they could each be in completely different locations in the datacenter. We will now move to a much larger topology – the 16x16x16 topology, which brings us up to 4,096 TPUs. In this topology, we use a total of 48 OCSs to connect 64 Cubes of 64 TPUs each. In the diagram below, each multi-colored cube represents one 64 TPU 4x4x4 cube. Taking the bottom right 4x4x4 cube as an example – this cube is connected to adjacent cubes along the Y-axis via OCSs. The maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs is built up using 144 4x4x4 cubes requiring 96 optical connections each amounting to a total requirement of 13,824 ports. Dividing this total port requirement by 288 (144 input and 144 output ports on each OCS) means we need 48 144x144 OCSs to support this maximum world size. But what is so great about Google’s unique ICI scale-up network – other than all the fancy cube diagrams one can spend countless hours drawing? World Size: The most obvious benefit is the very large 9,216 TPU maximum world size that the TPUv7 Ironwood supports. Even though the maximum slice size of 9,216 may rarely be used due to the drawback of diminished goodput, slices of thousands of TPUs can and are commonly used. This is far larger than the 64 or 72 GPU world size that is common in the merchant accelerator market and for other custom silicon providers. Reconfigurable and Fungibility: The use of OCSs mean that the network topology inherently supports the reconfiguration of network connections to support a high number of different topologies – in theory thousands of topologies. Google’s documentation site lists out 10 different combinations (image earlier in this section), but these are only the most common 3D slice shapes – there are many more available. Even slices of the same size can be reconfigured differently. In the simple example of a Twisted 2D Torus diagrammed below, we see how looping across to an index of a different X coordinate instead of an index of the same X coordinate can reduce the worst-case number of hops and the worst-case bisection bandwidth. This can help improve all to all collective throughput. A TPUv7 cluster will twist at the 4x4x4 cube level. Reconfigurability also opens the door to a broad diversity of parallelisms. In a 64 or 72 GPU world size, different parallelism combinations are generally limited to the factors of 64. When it comes to the ICI scale-up network, the possibilities for implementing topologies to precisely match the combination of data parallelism, tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism desired are plentiful. The fact that OCSs allow one to connect any “+” face of any cube to the “-“ face of any other cube means that there is complete fungibility of cubes. Slices can be formed out of any set of cubes. So if there are any faults or change in user demands or usage, this will not obstruct the formation of new topology slices. Lower Cost: Google’s ICI network has a lower cost than most switched scale-up networks. Though the FR optics used can be slightly expensive due to the use of circulators, the mesh network reduces the overall number of switches and ports that are needed and eliminates cost arising from connections between switches. Low Latency and Better Locality: The use of direct links between TPUs means that it is possible to achieve much lower latency for TPUs that are physically located close to one another or are reconfigured to connect directly to each other. TPUs that are close to each other also have better data locality. The Datacenter Network (DCN) is a network separate to ICI that serves the role of both a typical backend and front-end network. It connects across an even larger domain – 147k TPUs in the case of TPUv7 clusters. As discussed in our earlier post on Mission Apollo, where Google proposed replacing the Electronic Packet Switch (EPS)-containing spine layer of the traditional “Clos” architecture with Paloma Optical Circuit Switches (OCS), Google’s DCN consists of an optically switched Datacenter Network Interconnect (DCNI) layer that combines several aggregation blocks, each of which connects several 9,216 TPU ICI clusters. In 2022, Google’s Apollo project proposed a DCN architecture that described using 136x136 OCS switches for TPUv4 pods with a pod size of 4,096 TPUs. OCS switches at the DCNI layer were organized into 4 Apollo zones, each containing a maximum of 8 racks of 8 OCS switches for a total of 256 OCS switches. When it comes to Ironwood, to support up to 147k TPUv7s on the same network, we hypothesize that the number of ports on the OCS will nearly double as opposed to increasing the maximum number of OCS switches.The diagram below illustrates what an Ironwood DCN network using 32 racks holding 256 300x300 OCS switches could look like. Assuming that there is no oversubscription between the spine layers of each aggregation block, a maximum of 16 ICI pods can be connected in the DCN with 4 aggregation blocks connecting 4 ICI pods each – a total of 147,456 TPUs. The DCNI layer connects the 4 aggregation blocks – depicted as the top layer in the diagram below. As with ICI, FR Optics are used to connect to the OCSs in order to maximize bandwidth per port on each OCS. While existing Ironwood clusters may only have 1 or 2 aggregation blocks, Google DCN’s unique architecture allows for new aggregation blocks of TPUs to be added to the network without significant rewiring. By using OCSs for the DCNI layer, the size of the DCN fabric can be incrementally expanded and the network can be re-striped to support new aggregation blocks. Furthermore, the bandwidth of aggregation blocks can be upgraded without having to change the make-up of the DCN layer. This allows the link speeds of existing aggregation blocks to be refreshed without changing the fundamental architecture of the network itself. The process of fabric expansion cannot go on indefinitely – at significant scale, it becomes unmanageable to rewire the network. Traditionally, TPU software and hardware teams have been internal-facing. This comes with advantages such as the absence of pressure by marketing teams to inflate stated theoretical FLOPs. Another advantage of being only internal facing is that the TPU teams heavily prioritized internal feature requests & optimizing internal workloads. The disadvantage is that they did not care much about external customers or workloads. The number of external developers in the TPU ecosystem is way lower than in the CUDA ecosystem. This is one of the main weaknesses of the TPU as it is with all non-Nvidia accelerators. Google has since revised their software strategy for externally-facing customers and has already made major changes to their TPU team’s KPIs and how they approach contributing to the AI/ML ecosystem. There are 2 major changes that we will discuss: Massive engineering effort on PyTorch TPU “native” support Massive engineering effort on vLLM/SGLang TPU support The externalization strategy is clear to see by looking at the number of contributions from various TPU software repos by Google. We can see a noticeable increase in vLLM contributions starting from March. Then from May, the “tpu-inference” repo was created which is the official vLLM TPU unified back-end, and since then there has been a flurry of activity. Traditionally, Google only had first class support on the Jax/XLA:TPU stack (and TensorFlow/TF-Mesh RIP), but treated PyTorch on TPU as second class citizen. It relied on lazy tensor graph capture through PyTorch/XLA instead of having a first-class eager execution mode. Furthermore, it did not support PyTorch native distributed APIs (torch.distributed.*) or support PyTorch native parallelism APIs (DTensor, FSDP2, DDP, etc), but relied on weird out of tree XLA SPMD APIs (torch_xla.experimental.spmd_fsdp, torch_xla.distributed.spmd, etc.). This has led to a subpar non-native experience for external users that are used to the native PyTorch CUDA backend on GPUs and trying to switch to TPUs. In October, Google’s “Captain Awesome” Robert Hundt quietly announced in the XLA repo that they will be moving away from a non-native lazy tensor backend towards a “native” TPU PyTorch backend that will support eager execution by default & integration with torch.compile & DTensor & torch.distributed APIs, etc. They will be doing this through the use of PrivateUse1 TorchDispatch key. This will mainly be done for Meta who has renewed interest in buying TPUs & does not want to move to JAX. It will also make it for people that enjoy PyTorch and do not like JAX to use TPUs too. Previously from 2020 to 2023, heavily used by a couple of teams at Meta FAIR used PyTorch XLA on TPUs but it was not widely adopted thus Meta leadership ended up cancelling the contracts in 2023. PyTorch XLA on TPUs is not a fun experience. The Meta FAIR GCP TPUs back then were even run using SLURM and not anything typical you would find on TPU stack like GKE/Xmanager/borg/etc. This new PyTorch <> TPU will create a smoother transition for ML scientists that are used to PyTorch on GPUs to switch to PyTorch on TPUs and take advantage of the higher performance per TCO on TPUs. Pallas is the kernel authoring language for writing custom kernels for TPU (similar to cuTile or Triton or CuTe-DSL). Meta & Google have also started work on supporting Pallas kernels as a codegen target for the Torch Dynamo/Inductor compile stack. This will allow for native TPU integration with PyTorch’s native torch.compile API & allow for end users to register custom pallas ops into PyTorch. In addition to the core in tree PyTorch native APIs, there is also work behind the scenes on integrating TPU pallas kernel language as a codegen target for Helion. You can think of Helion as a higher-level language for writing decently performing kernels in a high level language. Users can think about Helion as a low level Aten operators rather than as high level Triton/Pallas due to its similarity matching much closer to the Native PyTorch Aten ops. Another area where the CUDA ecosystem is supreme is for open ecosystem inference. Historically, vLLM & SGLang support CUDA as first class (as ROCm as 2nd class citizen). Now Google wants in to the vLLM & SGlang open inference ecosystem and have announced beta TPU v5p/v6e support for vLLM & SGLang through a very “unique” integration. vLLM& SGLang currently does this by lowering the PyTorch modelling code into JAX and taking advantage of the existing mature JAX TPU compilation flow. In the future once PyTorch XLA RFC #9684 (aka native TPU PyTorch backend) gets implemented, vLLM & SGLang plan on evaluating whether to switch to using that instead of translating modelling from PyTorch to JAX through TorchAX. Google & vLLM claim that this lowering to jax path does not require any changes to the PyTorch modelling code but given how few models vLLM TPU supports so far, we doubt this is true. Furthermore, Google has open-sourced & integrated some of their TPU kernels into vLLM such as a TPU optimized paged attention kernels, compute-comms overlapped GEMM kernels & a couple other quantized matmul kernels. They do not yet have MLA-friendly TPU kernels. It would be interesting to see once Inductor Pallas TPU codegen integration is more mature, whether it is possible to integrate kernel fusion & pattern matching into the existing vLLM PassManager. SGLang is also looking into implementing an torch.compile PassManager to make managing kernel fusions for many models more maintainable. For Ragged Paged Attention v3, TPU handles it quite differently from vLLM GPU. vLLM manages KV cache with a technique similar to virtual memory and paging. However, this technique requires fetching dynamic addresses and performing scatter operations, something TPUs don’t support well. As a result, TPU kernels leverage fine-grained operation pipelining. Specifically, TPU’s page attention kernel prefetches query and KV blocks for the next sequence, so the memory loading is overlapped with computation. In the existing vLLM MoE kernel, we sort tokens by expert ID, dispatch tokens to the devices with the corresponding experts, perform group matrix multiplication, and combine tokens from experts back to original devices. However, the kernel performs poorly for two reasons: TPUs are slow at performing sorting operations, and the kernel is unable to overlap communication with computation. To work around this issue, Google developers designed all-fused MoE. All-fused MoE dispatches tokens for one expert per device at a time while overlapping MoE dispatch & MoE combine communications & avoiding sorting tokens by expert ID. With all-fused MoE, the Google engineer reported 3 - 4x speedup over existing kernels. Furthermore, another hardware unit in TPUs is the SparseCore (SC) used to accelerate embedding lookups and updates. SC comes with a scalar subcore SparseCore Sequencer (SCS) and multiple vector subcores SparseCore Tiles (SCT). SCT supports local and remote direct memory access at a more fine-grained 4-byte or 32-byte granularity, compared to TPU TensorCore’s 512-byte loads. This enables SC to perform gather/scatter operations and ICI communications while overlapping with TensorCore operations. At JAX DevLabs, we learned that programmability of SparseCore is a work in progress. We can expect Mosaic, the TPU custom kernel compiler, to compile in an MPMD fashion, where SCS and SCT executes different kernels, and different SparseCores can run different programs. We suspect once the programmability catches up, TPU MoE kernels would be able to perform dispatch and combine operations in a similar way as GPUs, instead of dispatching by expert IDs. In terms of disaggregated prefill decode, which we described in depth in our AMD 2.0 post, Google has experimental support on vLLM for single host disagg PD, not they do not support multi-host wideEP disagg prefill or MTP yet. These inference optimizations are critical to lower the TCO per million tokens and increase the perf per dollar and perf per watt. Furthermore, they have not yet integrated TPU vLLM inference support into popular RL frameworks like VERL, etc. Google is slowly moving in the correct direction in terms of how they approach the open AI/ML ecosystem especially for their “native” TPU backend. This week, there was an new inference benchmark on TPUv6e that dropped claiming that TPUv6e has 5x worst performance per dollar than NVIDIA GPUs. We disagree mainly due to 2 reasons. First of all, this is benchmark is on vLLM on TPUs which was only released an couple month ago thus does not yet have optimized performance. Google internal Gemini workloads & Anthropic workloads work on an internal custom inference stack that has better perf per TCO than NVIDIA GPUs. Secondly, Aritifical Analysis’s cost per million tokens is using the list price of $2.7/hr/chip for TPUv6e. No major customers of TPUs is paying anywhere close to that much for TPUv6e given the BOM is a tiny fraction of the H100. As everyone knows, most clouds have an high ball list price such that their account sales executives can do “car salesman” tactics and give massive discounts so that the customer thinks they are getting a good deal. The SemiAnalysis AI TCO Model tracks the acutal market rental price of TPUs across all the various contract lengths (1 month, 1 year, 3 years, etc). One part where Google is still approaching their software strategy incorrectly is with their XLA graph compiler & networking libraries & TPU runtime is still not open sourced nor well documented. This has led to frustrated users across the spectrum from advanced users to the average user of not being able to debug what is going wrong with their code. Furthermore their MegaScale codebase for multi-pod training is not open source either. We strongly believe that in order to accelerate the adoption, Google should open source it and the increased user adoption will outweigh all the software IP they will make public & free. Just like how PyTorch or Linux being open sourced rapidly increased adoption, open sourcing XLA:TPU & TPU runtime & networking libs will rapidly accelerated this too. Now that Google has gotten their act together on TPU and is selling them externally for people to put in their own datacenters, what are the implications on Nvidia’s business? Does Nvidia finally have a legitimate competitor that will put its market share and margins at threat? Behind the paywall, we will share our thoughts on what this means for Nvidia as well as reveal more about the TPU roadmap.

Title: Wildly Violent (and Profitable)
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/wildly-violent-and-profitable/
Time Published: 2025-11-29T23:00:03Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 29, 2025 The story of the world’s first IPO is a wild one. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in Amsterdam in 1602. Over the next hundred years, the VOC would dominate trade with Asia, wage multiple wars, commit genocide, and build monopolies. Along the way they sold gobs of spices, silks, and opium. But before all of that could happen, the VOC’s founders needed to raise money. So in 1602 the Dutch East India Company conducted the first initial public offering, giving all Dutchmen the chance to invest in this new venture. VOC Co-Founder Dirck Van Os | Source: Wikipedia The VOC IPO was unique because it was open to anyone, not just wealthy merchants and royalty. In total, 1,143 investors participated. Co-founder Dirck Van Os’ maid, Neeltgen Cornelis, was the second-to-last investor on the registry, having subscribed 100 guilders, which was likely her life’s savings. If Mrs. Cornelis the maid held onto her shares for the long run, she did quite well. In some years, VOC investors received a dividend equivalent to 75% of the capital they initially committed. Now, that dividend occasionally came in the form of spices (cloves and mace in particular). But hey, profit is profit… Dutch historian Lodewijk Petram has calculated the return of VOC shares (with dividends reinvested), and from its founding in 1602 through 1698, each 100 guilders invested turned into about 65,000. Source: The World’s First Stock Exchange VOC shares were groundbreaking because they were tradable on what would become the world’s first stock exchange. In addition, the Dutch East India Company introduced the concept of limited liability for shareholders. In other words, investors could only lose the amount they invested. They wouldn’t be responsible for the company’s debts or losses if the venture failed. The VOC set a new standard for how companies could raise capital and distribute profits. But the business model was downright diabolical… The VOC quickly became a publicly-traded empire. By 1637 it was worth the equivalent of around $6.9 trillion in today’s money. That’s double the value of the largest modern companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The Dutch East India Company maintained its own navy with around 40 warships and 200 trading vessels at any given time. It fought wars against Spain, Portugal, Britain, and various Asian powers. These great powers clashed over lucrative trade routes and assets in Asia. They fought over territories such as the Spice Islands and the Philippines, and sold opium to China. In one notorious incident, the VOC invaded the Banda Islands, the world’s only source of nutmeg and mace at the time. Back then these spices were more valuable than gold. Using mercenaries which included Japanese samurai, VOC Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen brutally massacred the Bandanese, publicly executing its leaders. Of around 15,000 natives, only a few hundred are believed to have survived. The VOC brought in slaves and other workers to take over Banda’s nutmeg and mace operations. These newly-acquired plantations were wildly profitable for shareholders. The company now had a total monopoly on two of the most valuable spices, which they sold into European markets at 1,000% markups. The Dutch East India Company was basically a publicly-traded evil empire. But for many years it did succeed in its mission of rewarding shareholders. Over time, however, the company lost its monopoly on spices and trade with Asia. Nutmeg and mace were smuggled out of Banda and cultivated elsewhere. Eventually the price of these once-rare goods collapsed. Artificial monopolies can only last so long. The VOC became increasingly corrupt and bureaucratic. It took on too much debt, and in time it essentially became a ponzi scheme. Ever-increasing debt loads were required to pay dividends. That’s a classic sign of the end approaching. The British East India Company eventually became a fierce competitor and seized many of the VOC’s prime territories. In 1799 the Dutch government dissolved the VOC and absorbed its assets and debts. The company had lasted almost 200 years. Despite the evil deeds committed by the Dutch East India Company, the firm played a critical role in the history of finance. It set a new standard for how companies could raise money and distribute profits to shareholders.

Title: Update: Coping With Inflation–Strategies for Investing, Bartering, Dickering, and Survival
URL: https://survivalblog.com/2025/11/30/update-coping-with-inflation-strategies-for-investing-bartering-dickering-and-survival/
Time Published: 2025-11-29T20:00:33Z
Full Content:
JWR’s Introductory Note: This is an update to an article that I wrote for SurvivalBlog back in December, 2007. It is part of a series of SurvivalBlog 20th Anniversary update re-posts, in recognition of the fact that the majority of readers did not join us until recent years. — As of September, 2025, statistics released by the Federal government claim that the current inflation rate is 3.0 percent. That is utter hogwash. Their statistics cunningly omit “volatile” food and energy prices. It is apparent that something is seriously out of whack. Meanwhile, the buying power of the US Dollar has fallen versus most other currencies. Both under Biden’s administration and now under Trump’s second term, economic growth has slowed substantially. Ironically, even though credit squeezes are considered deflationary for assets, the next recession (or perhaps depression) will probably turn out to be inflationary at the consumer level. With out-of-control Federal deficit spending and a massive, compounding National Debt, I expect to see inflation continue and accelerate in the coming years. Here at the Rawles Ranch, our four largest expenses each month are fuel, groceries, livestock feed, and insurance. Our health insurance costs have nearly doubled in the past two years. The average new car now costs $50,000. I’m sure that you have seen what has happened to food and feed prices in the past two years. Driven by higher fuel and fertilizer costs, some food costs have gone up by 25%. Beef prices, for example, recently spiked to near record highs. With all of the preceding in mind, we can realistically conclude that the “real world” consumer price inflation rate is somewhere around 12%. As I’ve written many times before, inflation is a form of robbery, albeit in slow motion. Since there is effectively only one currency in our country, it is the only way to do business. It may prove difficult, but you need to discard your traditional mindset about the currency and realize that we are riding a down escalator. An inflationary environment stands traditional logic on its head, since “Saving” becomes losing, and “Investing” is almost like throwing coins into a pond if the rate of return of any investment is lower than the real world inflation rate. The only noteworthy exception is investing in tangibles, which I’ve discussed at length in many SurvivalBlog articles and columns. Obviously, you can’t invest in anything perishable. But there are lots of practical things–like tools, common caliber ammunition and full capacity magazines–that have storage lives that can span decades or even centuries. With every passing day, your savings are gradually eroded. With an effective inflation rate of 12% per annum, applying the Rule of 72 we can see how much the purchasing power of every “saved” dollar is reduced over time. The following are some of my suggestions on how to protect yourself from the ravages of inflation: A.) Buy in Bulk Buy most of your staple foods and groceries at a discount or “warehouse” type stores such as Costco or Sam’s Club. Don’t overlook the “close-out” and “dented can” stores. (But, of course, avoid buying any bulged cans, or cans with dented rims.) Stock up on non-perishable items whenever they are on sale: thing like light bulbs, paper products, bar soap, house cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, lubricants, and so forth. As long as you protect these supplies from theft, moisture and vermin, they are better than money in the bank. (Again, money in the bank is being eroded by inflation.) These are tangibles bought at today’s prices, that you can use for many years to come. Here at the Rawles Ranch, we recently used up some spices, light bulbs, and aluminum foil that I bought at a military commissary in the 1980s–at what now seem like absurdly low prices. My only regret is that I didn’t buy more of them! This approach to stockpiling was described in the modern-day classic book “The Alpha Strategy” by John Pugsley. (Download this free book and read it!) If your local zoning and fire regulations allow it, buy your own gas and diesel fuel tanks. Also consider installing oversize propane or home heating oil tanks. Always ask about the availability of used tanks or ‘trade-in” tanks. Who cares if they are in some odd color? Re-paint them a nice neutral tan color. Wait and have your extra-large tanks re-filled each time there is a price dip. (Sadly, this only happens rarely, these days.) When getting competitive bids from tank suppliers, be sure to ask them to lock in the price per gallon for the initial fill for each new tank. To win your business, the tank salesman might be willing to commit to a price that is a few pennies per gallon below current market. (This adds up on a 2,000+ gallon tank!) B.) Learn to Barter Barter, by its very nature, shields you from inflation. Instead of using depreciating paper tokens as a means of exchange, you are directly exchanging a tangible for another tangible, or a service for a tangible, or a service for a service. As I’ve written previously in SurvivalBlog on several occasions, I do advocate stocking up on extra items for barter. However, it is with the proviso that you do not embark on buying goods dedicated for barter until after you have your family’s essential beans, bullets and band-aids squared away, following a well-balanced logistics plan. Dickering is a skill that can take years to develop. For some details on dickering skills, dee my updated SurvivalBlog article: The Savvy Barterer: References, Skills, and Tools for TEOTWAWKI Barter. Here in The Un-named Western State (TUWS), there is a lot of bartering that goes on, quite informally. I see it all the time: Cartridge Reloading for Snow Plowing, Eggs for Honey, Firewood for Horse Training, and Zucchini for just a smile and a thank-you. To be useful in barter, choose items that have most or all of the following seven attributes 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. 3.) Have longevity. 4.) Be easily divisible. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at reasonable cost. 6.) Have consistent quality. 7.) Have limited availability. Let’s discuss each of those briefly, in turn. 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. Nearly every family uses soap, but just a few need #7 Singer sewing machine needles. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. Name brands need no introduction. All others are suspect. 3.) Have longevity. Keep shelf lives in mind. If you cannot barter it all away before it goes bad, then you are buying too much. Even coal has a shelf life. 4.) Be easily divisible. Boxes of matches, boxes of cartridges, coils of rope, balls of twine, and cans of kerosene are perfect examples. OBTW, if you plan on dividing a commodity in barter transactions, then be sure to have the containers needed for parceling it out. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at a reasonable cost. Toilet paper has great appeal, but just $500 worth would completely fill the JASBORR. 6.) Have consistent quality. (For example, precious metals coins of known purity, or ammunition from a major manufacturer such as Winchester, Remington, or Federal.) 7.) Have limited availability. I mentioned zucchini earlier, for good reason. In North America, jars of freeze-dried instant coffee would be ideal, but in Central America, they would probably be laughed at. For some extensive lists of potential barter items suggested by readers, see the SurvivalBlog Archives for October 2005 and November 2005 (scroll down to November 1st and 2nd.) For a good rationale on selecting barter goods, see this November, 2006 SurvivalBlog article by OSOM. C.) Learn Several Valuable (Barterable) Skills Every family should have at least one home-based business that they can fall back on, on the event of an economic recession or depression. Concentrate on skills rather than goods for barter. The beauty of having skills to barter, is that most of them don’t require much raw material. So, unlike barter goods, you will never “run out”. By extension, it is best to have a skill that requires very little raw material. A profession or skill that also requires a specialized tool set is fine. However, if the skill also requires delivering a factory-made device to complete each transaction, then you might consider doing something else. (For example, installing burglar alarms might be profitable as long as you have a source of resupply, and as long as the power and telephone networks are functioning. But in a grid-down TEOTWAWKI how long could you continue running such a business?) Avoid developing a skill that appeals only to wealthy customers for discretionary spending. Those are the purchases that will be delayed or skipped altogether in an economic depression, Hence, shotgun checkering and engraving are poor choices, but septic tank pumping is a good one. Concentrate on a business that can be operated without the need for grid power. It is notewothy that most of the businesses in this category existed in the 19th Century. Who knows? Maybe buggy whip makers will make a comeback in the Second Great Depression. Ideally, you should have two or even three supplementary income businesses that you can fall back on to pay your mortgage and to buy necessities, if you lose your salaried job. Depending on the severity of the coming recession or depression, some home-based business may thrive, while others won’t. It is hard to predict which businesses will do well (although we have some clues based on the experience of the 1930s,) so there is safety in redundancy. D.) Learn How to Pinch a Penny Here are some suggestions (in no particular order), some of which I’ve borrowed from “The Encyclopedia of Country Living” by Carla Emery. (We highly recommend this book.) Distinguish your needs from your wants. Research and do some comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $10. Do extensive comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $100. Never buy on impulse. Plan your purchases well in advance, do your homework, and be patient. Refer to back issues of Consumer Reports magazine (at your local library) before making a purchase of a major appliance Develop the habit of dropping by thrift stores, second-hand stores, used book stores, and pawn shops. Find out on which days particular items are discounted at thrift stores. (Often by a system of colored price tags.) For big-ticket items, do lots of comparison pricing via the Internet. If you decide to buy locally, then bring the price print-outs with you, to use as “ammunition” when you dicker. Buy off-season. Buy winter clothes in summer, and vice versa. Buy livestock in October and November, when owners are facing expensive hay purchases if they “winter-over” their livestock. Use a clothesline instead of an electric clothes dryer. Use online tools like GasBuddy to find the best local gas and diesel prices. This is particularly important when you re-fill your gasoline and diesel storage cans and drums. Heat with wood. Cut, haul, split, and stack the wood yourself. Buy your guns and ammo at gun shows, not at gun shops. Learn how to dicker for the best prices. Buy at farm auctions, but beware of impulse purchases and run-away bidding. Make a list of your maximum bids during the preview and then stick to it religiously. Never bid emotionally, and never jump in on the bidding for an article unless you planned to bid on it before the auction began. Build/make/sew things for yourself rather than buying them factory-made. If you use any national brands, then clip coupons. Keep your coupons well organized (many folks like to use an accordion folder and they keep it handy in their car), and don’t lose track of coupon expiration dates. Buy most items used, rather than new. Never buy a new “big ticket” item like a car or truck “factory new”. Be sure to refer to Edmunds.com before making any vehicle purchase, to make sure you aren’t getting a “lemon” model or model-year. If you are buying a used vehicle worth $5,000 or more, then get the car’s VIN and pay for a CARFAX vehicle history report. These reports show a car’s crash history and even flood damage history. That research is well worth the expense. Negotiate prices with merchants. It is amazing who is willing to negotiate. (But I’ve had no luck in talking down bridge toll fees. I’ll keep trying.) Spend some of your Saturday mornings at garage sales and yard sales. Dress down when you go, and don’t be afraid to negotiate for better prices. Check Craig’sList, Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and your local “penny” or “nickel” classified ad papers for bargain items or even free items. Avoid fashion trends. Dress and drive modestly. Find out when there is a curb-side “free hauling” day offered by your local waste disposal contractor. If allowable by local law, cruise through the neighborhoods the night before the scheduled collection with your pickup or trailer. This is the way we found the majority of our small livestock cages. When buying things from private parties or small businesses, offer other items or your skills in barter. Watch for free tours at educational places like factories and museums. If your community has a well-established local currency, then utilize it to the utmost. Plant a large vegetable garden. Get plant starts for berries and other perennials from neighbors Cancel your newspaper subscriptions and carefully limit your magazine subscriptions. These days, there is so much news and information available on the Internet free of charge (you are looking at some of it right now) that hardcopy newspapers are now mostly expensive dinosaurs. But there are two notable exceptions: 1.) If you are a consistent and well-organized coupon clipper. If that is the case, then you might want to get a “Sunday paper only” subscription.), and 2.) Subscribing to small-town weekly newspapers in your retreat locale. Reading one of these papers regularly is important for developing local intelligence and for “fitting in” by being knowledgeable about local geography, personalities, events, politics, and lore. Change your own car crankcase oil and make most of your own car repairs. Buy a food dehydrator. It will pay for itself many times over. Home Freeze-Dryers are also now available, but before buying one, carefully consider how much you will use it. It takes a long time for these expensive units to pay for themselves. Learn how to do your own water bath and pressure canning. Once you have, you’ll have no excuse to ever buy another store-bought jar of jam, jelly, or applesauce. Buy a few dairy sheep or a cow. Sell or barter the excess milk, or feed the excess to your chickens and/or hogs Cut out needless expenses. (Like those $4 lattes at Starbucks and $20 trips to the movie theater.) If you have a mortgage at a rate that is more than 1 percent higher than the prevailing rate, then consider refinancing. Just beware of any hidden costs and, of course, avoid Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs.) Swap CDs and DVDs with friends and relatives or check them out from your local library rather than buying new ones. Keep your online video subscriptions to a minimum. Develop a budget, and stick to it. If you have a credit card, then pay it off in full every month. No exceptions! Don’t fall into the easy credit trap. Remember, the card is only in your wallet for convenience, emergency expenses (such as car repairs when travelling), and as a means to gain frequent flier miles or points for programs like gasoline purchase rebates. If you recognize that you don’t have sufficient self-control, then leave your credit card(s) at home–or cut them up. Make detailed lists of all of your expenses, and scrutinize them weekly. Look for ways to reduce expenses. Shop around for the lowest car/health/home/life insurance rates. A few hours of research on the Internet could easily save you $1,000+ per year. Unless you know for certain that you want a book as a permanent reference, then use the public library or try to find it online. Don’t overlook the inter-library loan system. Take advantage of free or low-cost training available from organizations like the American Red Cross and FEMA. (Just beware of any socialist/statist nonsense that they try to feed you along with the training.) Learn how to repair small appliances and engines. Don’t buy store-bought meat. Hunt for or raise your own. Handload your own ammunition. Get out of debt and stay out of debt. Paying interest is throwing money away. Forestall making purchases to avoid indebtedness. Instant gratification creates decades of debt. Proviso #1: Do not attempt to save money by foregoing carrying insurance, or by forestalling any expenses that have an impact on health, hygiene, or safety. For example, if your windshield gets cracked beyond repair, then replace it. If your chimney needs cleaning, then don’t delay cleaning it. (But of course buy your own brush and rod sections and learn how to do the job yourself.) If you have a toothache, don’t delay in seeing your dentist. (But ask about possibly paying in barter when you do!) Proviso# 2: Don’t be “Penny-wise and Pound-foolish.” If you are a highly-paid professional, then take into account the value of your time. For example, if you are an anesthesiologist, you should probably find a few more billable cases rather than taking up cartridge handloading. Proviso# 3: Don’t skimp on education. That is an expense that will make you money in the long run.

Title: Threat To Jobs, Democracy: Why Over 1,000 Amazon Employees Are Pushing Back Against Its AI Policy
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/threat-to-jobs-democracy-why-over-1000-amazon-employees-are-pushing-back-against-its-ai-policy
Time Published: 2025-11-29T14:38:32Z
Full Content:
In what is being seen as one of the largest internal protest at a tech firm, more than 1,000 employees have signed an open letter warning against the impact of the company's strong AI push. The letter, reviewed by The Guardian, points out AI's triple threat to employment, democracy and climate. Staff from across tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft have backed the letter and engineers, product managers and warehouse workers from Amazon are among the signatories. The letter comes in the backdrop of layoffs made by Amazon as part of its AI expansion plan through scaling up the use of artificial intelligence tools across operations; in turn, prompting questions around crucial topics like job security, workplace surveillance and environmental impact. The layoff announcements in recent period have been seen through the prism of multibillion-dollar commitments for new AI-linked data centres in the US along with rapid AI automations. This is something which has compounded fears of further job cuts, on top of an already mounting pressures related to higher productivity quotas. A senior software engineer was quoted by The Guardian as saying that employees are feeling the pressure to use AI tools for coding and writing, and underscored that management now expects "twice as much work because of AI tools". Another worker highlighted that the use of AI tools is being used as a justification for random productivity quotas despite the tools not bridging the gap. The worker-led initiative also calls upon Amazon to ensure that its data centres run on clean energy so as not to deteriorate the climate situation further. Moreover, it also demands restricting AI products that could encourage and enable "violence, surveillance and mass deportation", and creation of worker-led bodies to oversee how AI is deployed internally. The protest at one of the world’s largest technology companies has become a symbol of growing internal distress among workers along with their resistance to generative AI is reshaping workflows and power dynamics.

It can serve as an apt gift for ones who love seasonal flavors but don’t want a big machine. More post-Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday fell on Dec. 1 this year, which means it’s officially over, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still deals to be found. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales went live across the biggest retailers. Now that the day is done and dusted, remaining deals are starting to run dry, so time is running out to shop. Almost all major retailers offered discounts for Cyber Monday, including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as specialized retailers like B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can run out of stock quickly, so online shopping often gives you the best shot at grabbing what’s left. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and some extended them into Cyber Monday. While the official event is over, a handful of last‑minute bargains are still live today, but they won’t last much longer. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We've rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll continue to highlight the best lingering deals throughout this extended sale period. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive, the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: If you were laid off, you could 'boomerang' back to your old company. Here's who's more likely to be asked back.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sometimes a layoff isn't a farewell forever. Rehires of people who were laid off could become more popular in a shaky job market. Visier, a people analytics firm, looked at how many people were rehired at their previous employers within 15 months of being terminated. Visier found about 5.3% of laid-off employees were rehired, based on global data from 2018 to 2024 covering 142 large organizations with over 2 million employee records. Andrea Derler, principal researcher at Visier, expects boomerang hires of people who were previously laid off to increase as companies figure out how to handle "AI-induced pressures" and economic uncertainty. "In times of extreme turmoil, where workforce planning is made even more difficult due to rapid, unexpected, and unpredictable changes, layoff boomerangs seem to be more prevalent," Derler said. Separately, ADP Research found that the share of new hires who were boomerang employees increased from 26% in March 2022 to 35% this past March. "In an era where the outlook on the jobs market is fuzzy or uncertain, it makes sense for both employers and employees to stick with what they know," Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, previously told Business Insider. The US is in a mostly frozen job market marked by low layoffs, but also low hiring. Job growth slowed from a monthly average of 111,000 between January and March to about 62,000 between July and September. Layoffs in the US are low, but announcements are adding up. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that there have been over 1 million job cuts announced from US-based employers this year as of October. Verizon, Amazon, government agencies, and others have made headlines for their decisions. Derler said Visier's data doesn't show a surge in manager layoffs, but they are also more likely to be rehired. "Organizations realize that it's really hard to find a good manager because the manager is responsible for a lot of things: performance, productivity, but also engagement of other employees," she said. Among the handful of industries Visier looked at, finance and retail had the highest rates of laid-off employees that were rehired at 7.5% each. Derler said retail has a lot of turnover, so it makes sense that workers may go back and forth. She suspects the rate for the finance industry is because the work duties involve certain skills and expertise. Instead of tapping into a new talent pool, businesses may turn to people previously on their payroll and who have already demonstrated their capabilities. Meanwhile, Derler said tech's rate of 4.3%, below the average rate and the lowest among the five industries looked at, could be because desired skills and knowledge quickly evolve. So, unlike finance, firms may want to look at a new talent pool. "Prompt engineers a year ago was the big job — nobody talks about prompt engineering anymore," Derler said. "Skills are changing so fast, so that's why I can assume that they'll be looking for new people with new skills rather than those who they know." Derler said all parties need to have good "layoff hygiene," where both sides are respectful. She said workers should also try not to internalize their layoff or think it's something they did wrong. She also emphasized the importance of always keeping up your skills, so that if you are laid off, you can confidently add your knowledge to your résumé or talk about it in an interview. Derler also suggested staying connected with people you worked well with in case you do rejoin — not just so it's pleasant to return, but because they might know about an opening. Derler said she interviewed some boomerangs and found some were still in touch with their old boss. "When their manager then realized they actually needed somebody again, they would be the first that they would call," she said. "Makes sense, right? Because you know the person, you get on well with them." Have you gone back to your previous job? Are you a hiring manager who has made boomerang hires?

Title: Want to work from home? Here's how 7 people got their managers on board — or secured flexibility themselves

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of battling LA traffic, Leslie Snipes decided it was time to talk to her manager. For the first few months of her job as a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency, she drove 60 to 90 minutes to the office a few days a week — but the commute eventually began to take a toll. "I was wasting hours just sitting in traffic," said the 34-year-old. In April of last year, Snipes decided to ask her manager whether she could work remotely almost exclusively. She explained that she'd be more productive working from home and that her team's strongest bonding often happened during business trips and off-site projects. Snipes said she received verbal approval in less than a day — and that she now typically works from the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," she said. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." While some workers are more than happy to return to the office for camaraderie and a change of scenery, Business Insider spoke to seven people who have found ways to secure flexible work arrangements — whether or not they're officially sanctioned. Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work, said work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years, despite companies' implementing stricter return-to-office mandates. He believes that's offset by other employers — many of them smaller companies and startups — offering more flexibility. He also hypothesizes that employees are securing exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. Bloom pointed out a possible motivating factor for allowing these exceptions: Managers are generally judged on how their teams perform, and they don't want to risk their best talent quitting or becoming less productive if they're forced back to the office. For this reason, some managers may choose not to enforce office attendance policies too strictly. "Managers ultimately care about their team performance," he said. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers about how they've responded to corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and return-to-office mandates.

Read more on the topic: Childcare responsibilities are a common factor pushing workers to secure work-from-home flexibility. In November 2024, Georg Loewen began working as a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency with a three-day-a-week in-office policy, which required him to make a roughly one-hour commute from New Jersey to Manhattan. But that commute proved challenging. Loewen was responsible for dropping off his one-year-old daughter at day care most mornings, and the 8 a.m. drop-off often made it difficult to catch the ideal 8:20 train that would get him to the office just before 9 — the next one wouldn't get him in until after 10. Even when he was on time, finding a parking spot at the station wasn't guaranteed. Early this year, Loewen's manager initiated a conversation about his challenges getting into the office. Eventually, they came to an agreement. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said the 34-year-old. Loewen said he typically works from the office once or twice a week. His current routine involves dropping off his daughter, heading home to park his car, and then riding a foldable bike 1.5 miles to the station, which allows him to avoid the hassle of finding a parking spot. He said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but added that he's consistently felt supported. He may need to work from the office more frequently as his team grows, he said, but for now, he's grateful for the leeway he's been given. A Wisconsin-based mother of three is similarly thankful for the flexible understanding she came to with her manager. In 2023, she'd considered leaving her corporate manufacturing role after the company announced a five-day-a-week office policy. She worried she couldn't meet her childcare responsibilities with a two-hour round-trip commute. Instead, she had an "off the record" conversation with her manager about how much remote work she could get away with. She said they told her to "be here as much as you can." As long as she was in the office a few days a week — especially on days with key in-person meetings — they wouldn't stand in her way. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Some workers have found creative ways to spend less time at the office. When Elysa Ellis began looking for a new role last year, she was hesitant to give up the remote work flexibility she'd grown used to. After landing an interview with a local nonprofit that required employees to work from the office five days a week, she came with a prepared request: a 9-to-3 schedule, instead of the typical 9-to-5. Ellis said it was important for her to be able to pick up her two children from school around 3 p.m. and spend time with them until her husband finished work. "My children are young, so I knew that stepping into an in-office role would impact them a lot," she said, adding, "I felt like I had nothing to lose." By the time Ellis was offered the job, her request had been granted. She would work from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. — and still receive her full salary. In 2022, when a millennial IT professional heard rumors that his employer might implement a stricter return-to-office policy, he began searching for a new role. Shortly after, he landed an offer for a remote position similar to his current role. However, he was hesitant to resign while his company's official policy still allowed remote work, so he decided to secretly juggle both roles — earning $250,000 annually, roughly double his previous income. And if his initial employer ever adopted a stricter in-office policy, he figured he had a backup plan. "I ultimately decided to try it since I could easily just drop one if it was too much," he said. For a millennial finance manager at Amazon, maximizing his work-from-home time meant doing the bare minimum at the office. When Amazon announced in 2023 that it would require corporate employees to work from the office three days a week, he began going in the required number of days — but only worked between nine and 12 hours total across all three days. He said it was feasible because he was the only member of his team based at that office. "I would go into the office for a few hours, avoid rush hour, and fulfill my badging requirement," he said. For some, the simplest way to secure work-from-home flexibility is to find a job that offers it from day one. After being laid off from a remote job, a New Jersey-based e-commerce professional landed an offer last year for a role at JPMorgan — one that would require him to commute to a Manhattan office three days a week. As he considered the offer, he estimated that commuting would take nine hours a week and cost him more than $7,000 a year. Around the same time, he received another offer — this one for a remote role with a salary about $5,000 lower than the JPMorgan position. When he compared the two jobs in terms of what he'd earn for every hour he'd have to "invest" in them — factoring in both commuting time and related costs — he said the decision was easy. "JPMorgan just could not compete," he said, adding: "A 40-hour week plus nine commute hours is basically a 50-hour week for the salary that they were offering." Jump to
