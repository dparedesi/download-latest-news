Title: Ethereum TVL Set For Explosive Growth: Sharplink CEO Foresees Tenfold Surge In 2026

Joseph Chalom, the CEO of Sharplink, has outlined an optimistic forecast for Ethereum’s (ETH) future, emphasizing a significant increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the network in the coming year. According to a report from CoinMarketCap, Chalom anticipates that the stablecoin market will soar to $500 billion by December 2026. Currently, the total market capitalization for stablecoins stands at approximately $308.46 billion, suggesting a 62% growth from current figures. Given that Ethereum is responsible for processing over half of all stablecoin transactions across various blockchain networks, the projected expansion in stablecoin issuance and transaction volume is set to significantly elevate the network’s TVL. Chalom further predicts that the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will also witness substantial growth, potentially reaching a total value of $300 billion next year. This is expected to move beyond tokenizing individual securities and funds to encompass complete fund complexes, thereby increasing Ethereum’s relevance in the financial ecosystem. Key to this expected growth is the increasing involvement of major financial institutions from traditional finance such as BlackRock, which has shown heightened interest in blockchain technologies over the past year. Chalom predicts that it could serve as a catalyst for moving significant assets onto Ethereum’s infrastructure. The rise in total value locked usually indicates increased network utilization, which can bolster market sentiment and may influence Ethereum price dynamics. Currently, data shows ETH’s TVL at approximately $68.20 billion. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently expressed skepticism about Ethereum reaching new price highs in 2026, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s (BTC) market conditions. However, Chalom anticipates that sovereign wealth fund holdings and tokenization efforts on Ethereum could grow five- to tenfold in the coming year. This potential increase is attributed to competitive pressures that may encourage institutional investors, who have previously been hesitant about cryptocurrency exposure, to reconsider their strategies as peer adoption accelerates. Moreover, Chalom believes that the integration of on-chain artificial intelligence (AI) agents and prediction markets will gain mainstream traction in 2026, further driving activity and adding value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately, Sharplink’s CEO stressed that the convergence of institutional interest from traditional finance firms, expanded applications, and the involvement of sovereign funds could significantly position Ethereum for impressive TVL growth in the near future. Currently, Ethereum is trading at around $2,930, marking a 13% year-to-date decline for the leading altcoin. Compared to its all-time high of $4,964 reached earlier this year, the cryptocurrency is currently trading 40% below this level.

Title: Top 10 Stories of 2025

Time Published: 2025-12-30T06:00:55Z

Each year, our most-read stories offer a snapshot of where the programmatic industry is at this moment. This year, programmatic companies faced tough decisions about privacy, awkward acquisitions and the cookie die-off that never quite happened. Programmatic is an industry that’s long past its youthful growth spurt and immaturity. Now it’s dealing with the discomfort of regulation and attention from lawmakers. While the programmatic web faced these tough decisions, connected TV felt the warm, golden glow of programmatic transformation. CTV represents an opportunity for programmatic natives and for streamers that haven’t fully embraced how data and automation can sweeten the revenue from their subscribers. Our top 10 stories highlighted programmatic growing pains, CTV’s evolution, how closely watched The Trade Desk continues to be and more. Here they are, starting at the top: 1. Google Is Found Guilty Of Operating An Ad Tech Monopoly (!) (April) Our top story of the year should come as no surprise to our readers. What happens to Google’s sell-side ads business affects everyone in the programmatic industry. The remedies to Google’s monopoly will have particular resonance among publishers and SSPs. The guilty verdict found that Google unlawfully tied its publisher ad server with its ad exchange, setting the stage for the remedies phase in the fall, when the judge decided what punishment to mete out to Google. 2. Microsoft Is Shutting Down Invest, The One-Time AppNexus DSP Business (May) Over the years, stories about AppNexus (later renamed Xandr, then Microsoft Invest) always ranked among the most popular AdExchanger stories – both because of its independent stance as a foil to Google and its attention-grabbing moves as a company. So it makes sense that the AppNexus DSP did not go quietly into the night. Industry leaders paid attention to what this shutdown means for the broader DSP and SSP space as well as Microsoft’s strategy. 3. The Trade Desk Is Acquiring Advertising Metadata Startup Sincera (January) The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk …. made an acquisition. TTD reversed its historically un-acquisitive approach this year and bought Sincera, known for gathering advertising metadata to stamp out fraud and help advertisers improve their decision-making. In the months since, Sincera’s co-founder Mike O’Sullivan has become a public-facing decision-maker and representative for the DSP, and Sincera’s tech has woven itself into the Trade Desk’s seller strategy. 4. The Record CCPA Fine Against Healthline Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Publishers (July) The specter of CCPA enforcement has loomed over the programmatic industry for years. And Healthline’s fine, the first one to hit a publisher, offered a concrete example of what media companies have to worry about it. Tracking pixels and cookies on the health publisher’s site, a common addition to publishers’ sites, could telegraph a person’s health status. For publishers that have long gathered behavioral data about users based on the type of articles they read, this fine signaled the types of behaviors being tracked – as well as tracking, period – are no longer in compliance with the law. 5, The Trade Desk Promises Big Changes After Missing Its Q4 Guidance (February) The Trade Desk has long been a darling of Wall Street. But when it missed its Q4 guidance at the beginning of this year, investors started to worry not just about The Trade Desk but publicly traded ad tech companies. The earnings miss kicked off a year of change and challenges at The Trade Desk, as it sought to get back on track and push the industry on issues like transparency and labeling resellers. Even so, it ended the year with layoffs. 6. As CTV Blooms, It’s Knives Out For The Trade Desk’s Take Rate (April) The Trade Desk also faced more competition this year. Amazon’s DSP is breaking out beyond its endemic commerce advertisers. And like Google and YouTube, Amazon is paired up with Prime Video, the AVOD-by-default platform brimming with scale and inventory. But that’s not the only CTV DSP in the mix. With a rundown on the competitive landscape of CTV DSPs, this story underlined the challenge of bringing programmatic tech to CTV. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. 7. Meet The Netflix Ads Suite, Introduced By Ads VP Nicolle Pangis (March) After years of rumors, Netflix finally added an ad-supported subscription option. And the CTV industry wanted to know more. When Ads VP Nicolle Pangis appeared at CTV Connect this year, she revealed details about Netflix’s product road map and the product acronym, NAS, that will house the streamer’s ad tech ambitions. 8. Lawmakers Demand Answers From Ad Tech Vendors Allegedly Monetizing CSAM (February) The lack of transparency in ad tech has long meant advertisers buy ads in places where they don’t want them. But putting ads in illegal places, such as on CSAM, moves the conversation of “brand safety” into a different realm. When Adalytics discovered ads placed on illegal content earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to multiple ad tech companies demanding answers. 9. Google Isn’t Launching A User Choice Prompt For Third-Party Cookies In Chrome (April) For years, Google Chrome plotted a replacement to third-party cookies. Then it walked back that decision, validating the long-held industry skepticism around Google actually going through with that plan. Instead, Chrome was going to build its version of Apple ATT, the user choice prompt that asked users if they really, truly wanted cookies. Just kidding. Google wasn’t going to do that, either – a new story that was both a bombshell and the latest industry I-told-you-so. 10. The Ad Context Protocol Aims To Make Sense Of Agentic Ad Demand (October) How will ad tech change once agents enter the scene? It’s possible agents will negotiate campaign deals on behalf of clients. And AdCP, or Ad Context Protocol, is a new protocol that will standardize those interactions. The steady hum of traffic to this article post-publication speaks to the many minds figuring out the future of AI in digital ad transactions.

You’re gonna love it. If you have any issues signing up for premium, please email me at ez@betteroffline.com. One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

Title: I was wrong about Elon. But he was wrong too

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. I was wrong, as it turns out, about Elon Musk. At least on this occasion. A year ago, I’d predicted that Musk would quit Tesla. It was a bold prediction but one backed with evidence: Sales of Tesla’s electric cars fell in 2025, the first annual decline in more than a decade, and for the billionaire to be juggling roles leading X, Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, the Boring Company and Neuralink seemed unsustainable. I thought that the incessant tweeting, the controversies and constant outrages, the demanding role in Donald Trump’s incoming administration, and a decline in vehicle sales would all collectively catch up to Musk. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board, with “Tesla’s stock sinking and some investors irritated Musk’s White House focus”, had gotten serious about looking for Musk’s successor. Credit: Bloomberg “After constant controversies and distractions, it will all come to a head in 2025, and Musk will be forced to hand over the reins at Tesla, a company many mistakenly think he founded,” I wrote. Musk hit back. “I predict that the Sydney Morning Herald will continue to lose readership in 2025 for relentlessly lying to their audience and boring them to death,” he wrote in response to a screenshot of my article posted by one of his followers. Elon Musk’s tweet predicting a difficult year for the Sydney Morning Herald.Credit: Twitter Elon was wrong. Statistics from Roy Morgan show the Sydney Morning Herald grew its total readership by 11 per cent in 2025. I too, was wrong. But I was oh so close to being right. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board, with “Tesla’s stock sinking and some investors irritated Musk’s White House focus”, had gotten serious about looking for his successor. “Board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla’s next chief executive, according to people familiar with the discussions,” the newspaper reported. Tesla’s eight-person board, which is chaired by Australian businesswoman Robyn Denholm, denied the accuracy of that report and ultimately went the other way. They issued Musk the largest CEO pay deal ever - a stock-based compensation plan that could be worth close to $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) over roughly a decade - a move designed to keep Musk focused on Tesla rather than shifting his attention elsewhere. Tesla’s chairperson Robyn Denholm said Elon Musk was a “generational leader” and the right CEO during this “transformative period of time.”Credit: Bloomberg So, I maintain that I was on the money with my prediction that Elon’s controversies, distractions and workload were unsustainable. But he didn’t quit Tesla. What about my other predictions? Virtual reality having another year of unfulfilled promise, seems largely accurate. By Apple’s usual standards, sales of its $5999 Vision Pro VR headsets have clearly fallen short of expectations, with the company reportedly selling hundreds of thousands fewer than it had anticipated. Tick. I predicted crypto would soar and bitcoin would surpass $US200,000 - wrong there - and my prediction of an ‘AI winter’ beginning was also off, with AI stocks like Nvidia and others staying hot. Flying cars have also not taken off. They remain decidedly grounded. Some of my other stray predictions seem spot on. It’s early days, but Australia’s teen social media ban has indeed been largely successful so far, with other countries taking notice, and Trump’s tariffs have hit electronics prices. There was no major AI deepfake reported in Australia’s federal election, however. Here are seven predictions for 2026. I’ll probably get half of them wrong. But the fun is in the guessing. The ingredients are all there. Government agencies are rushing to deploy AI for “efficiency.” Corporations are automating decisions about loans, insurance, hiring, and welfare. And Australia’s track record on algorithmic accountability - Robodebt, anyone? - suggests the guardrails aren’t up to the task. The scandal could take several forms: a Services Australia AI that wrongly denies benefits to thousands of vulnerable people; a major employer’s hiring algorithm found to systematically discriminate; a health insurer using AI to deny claims based on race or income ... AI will inevitably stuff up somewhere, the only question is which sector gets caught first. Remember how everyone mocked Google Glass? Meta’s smart glasses are proving that the tech industry’s first instinct - wear a computer on your face - wasn’t wrong, just premature. The difference is in form factor and social acceptability. These actually look like normal sunglasses. You don’t look like a tech bro uberdork wearing them to the pub. And with AI features built in, they’re genuinely useful: real-time translation, object identification (ask them: ‘What am I looking at?’), hands-free messaging, and navigation that doesn’t require you to stare at your phone while walking into traffic. Meta Platforms is seeking to turn its burgeoning smart glasses into a must-have product.Credit: Bloomberg The 2026 iteration will likely add a subtle heads-up display, and that’s when things get interesting. Apple is reportedly working on its own version, which will legitimise the category further. This won’t be VR-style hype, it’ll be more of a slow burn. But by year’s end, smart glasses will be the wearable that actually sticks, succeeding where VR flopped. BYD already outsells Tesla in Australia in some months, and that’s just the beginning. The Chinese manufacturer - along with MG, GWM, and newcomers like Zeekr and Xiaomi - are flooding the market with competent, affordable EVs that legacy carmakers simply can’t match on price. BYD electric vehicles parked in a private storage yard in Kilsyth in Melbourne’s east.Credit: Aaron Francis Australia seems uniquely vulnerable to some of these dynamics: we have no local car manufacturing left, and consumers are historically happy to buy whatever’s cheapest. Tesla’s brand remains politically toxic to some buyers thanks to Musk’s antics, and Ford and Toyota are still playing catch-up when it comes to EVs at scale. By the end of 2026, Chinese manufacturers will command between 30 and 40 per cent of Australia’s EV market, and nobody in Canberra will quite know what to do about it. Nvidia has been the undisputed king of the AI boom. Its processors are the pickaxes in a gold rush that sent its market cap past $US3 trillion. But 2026 is when gravity reasserts itself. Giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are all developing custom AI chips to reduce their dependency on Nvidia, whose sky-high share price has long seemed almost impossible to justify. Critically, the AI infrastructure spending spree can’t continue at this rate forever. At some point, companies need to see returns. This doesn’t mean that Nvidia becomes irrelevant. It just means that its era of unquestioned dominance - and its title as the Most Important Company In The World - ends in 2026. Quantum computing is - maybe - set for a breakout year.Credit: PsiQuantum Quantum computing has been ‘five years away’ for every year I’ve been reporting on the industry. But Google’s Willow chip and IBM’s steady progress on error correction suggest we’re approaching a genuine inflection point. The breakthrough won’t be quantum computers replacing your laptop. It’ll be a clear demonstration of quantum advantage on a problem that actually matters: think simulating a molecule for drug discovery, or cracking an encryption protocol (which will terrify everyone). When it happens, every CEO will suddenly need a ‘quantum strategy’ and start-ups will raise billions on pitch decks that don’t make sense. Most of the hype will be largely premature, just as it was with AI in 2023, but the narrative will shift permanently. Quantum will go from ‘interesting science experiment’ to ‘inevitable technology disruption’ next year. After Optus, Medibank, Latitude, and a parade of smaller breaches, the statistical reality is grim: Australia’s big four banks are operating on borrowed time. They’re attractive targets: massive repositories of sensitive financial data, legacy systems that are barely held together and complex supply chains with countless potential entry points. Australia’s banks have invested heavily in security, but so have every other company that’s been breached. It only takes one missed patch, one phished employee, or one compromised vendor for the worst to happen. And when it does happen, the fallout will be nuclear. Banking data is more sensitive than telco records. The political response will be severe, potentially including personal liability for executives and board members who failed to prioritise security, and regulators like APRA may come into the firing line. The silver lining is that it might be the shock that forces an overhaul of Australia’s approach to cybersecurity, from mandatory breach disclosure timelines to more severe penalties for negligence. The Melanie Perkins-led company times its listing perfectly, riding renewed appetite for profitable tech. Its AI design tools are a moat rather than a commodity, and enterprise adoption accelerates as marketing teams ditch expensive Adobe subscriptions. Canva co-founders Cliff Obrecht and Melanie Perkins, pictured with fellow co-founder Cameron Adams.Credit: Canva The blockbuster public listing on New York’s Nasdaq becomes Australia’s biggest tech success story in history, finally putting Sydney and Australia on the map as a serious global tech hub. Hundreds of new millionaires - many of whom are the company’s early employees - are minted in the process, unlocking a tidal wave of capital. An AI-written song tops the charts; a prominent Australian influencer is exposed as largely AI-generated; Google’s search dominance faces its first real threat in decades. Copyright © 2025

Title: New BioShock 4 leak details Casino location, ‘Flushers’ enemies amid troubled development rumors
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-BioShock-4-leak-details-Casino-location-Flushers-enemies-amid-troubled-development-rumors.1193908.0.html

BioShock, released in 2007, was developed and published by 2K Boston and 2K Australia; the former would later become Irrational Games. The game was set in the city of Rapture, an underwater city built in the 1940s by a wealthy businessman who sought to create a utopia for the elite, free from the control and limitations of governments. To protect Rapture from outside influence, all contact with the outside world is banned. As the city prospered, the wealth disparity grew larger and larger, leaving the top few with more than they needed and the rest to survive on mere crumbs. It was in this poverty-stricken environment that certain events would lead to an all-out war between the city’s wealthy and the downtrodden. The game received universal acclaim, being praised for its narrative themes, visual designs, and gameplay. It is also considered to be one of the best games ever made. It was followed by two sequels, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite. Back in December 2019, BioShock 4 was finally announced by 2K Games, along with a new developer, Cloud Chamber, though there was no official release date. Speculation has suggested a 2027-2028 release date. The last time the public had heard of the project was not good news. Leaks told a tale of development hell over the studio, granted, the daunting task of making a sequel to what has been labeled one of the greatest games of all time. A Bloomberg article, following the leaks, suggested that the company was experiencing another shakeup after failing an internal review at 2K Games. According to Bloomberg, 2K said, "working hard to set Bioshock up for the best possible future." It continued, "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path." Recently, an online publication, MP1st, has claimed that leaks shared directly with the publication reveal a Casino that will serve as a prominent setting in the series. It also speaks about two potential vital characters. Flushers, or as the leak calls them, are the standard enemy players might face in the new world of BioShock 4. While the leaks may intrigue players and keep them craving more, it's worth noting that the game was once again delayed due to the 2025 layoffs at Cloud Chamber. BioShock 4 has yet to receive an official release date, but it might be closer to 2027 or 2028 than 2026, even given the leaks reported so far. With Netflix also working on a movie adaptation of the original title, plenty is happening in the BioShock universe, even if gamers will fully experience most of it after a significant time gap.

Title: Dedrone by Axon’s 10th Annual Airspace Security Report 2026
URL: https://soldiersystems.net/2025/12/29/dedrone-by-axons-10th-annual-airspace-security-report-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-29T23:00:00Z
Full Content:
As the global leader in airspace security, Dedrone by Axon is at the cutting edge of how drone technology is reshaping public safety, enterprise operations, and defense. The sky is becoming one of the most dynamic and contested domains in modern life, that now demands continuous awareness and coordination. The coming years will redefine who protects our airspace and how, as drones become inseparable from daily operations and security missions. The line between “drone use” and “drone defense” is disappearing. This 10th Annual Report includes Dedrone by Axon’s predictions for how this new era of airspace will evolve — and how agencies, enterprises, and nations will adapt to a world where awareness and control of the sky defines safety and security. Airspace is the new front line. We have examined both counter-drone (AKA counter uncrewed aircraft systems or CUAS) trends as well as positive drone usage across public safety and defense sectors. Public Safety & Enterprise CUAS Prediction 1: Exponential Increase in CUAS Adoption Across Public Safety Agencies From stadiums to state fairs: airspace defense becomes part of every security plan. Counter-drone systems will expand far beyond airports and stadiums into every major public venue—from outdoor concerts to parades, sports arenas, and civic gatherings. The World Cup in 2026 and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will be the catalysts that normalize counter-drone as part of every large-scale security posture. Expect state and local agencies to begin mandating airspace security audits for any event over a specified attendance threshold. Prediction 2: Airspace Security Becomes an Enterprise Compliance Standard In 2026, airspace security will move from emerging technology to corporate requirement. Major facilities—especially those related to energy, logistics, and technology—will begin including drone detection and tracking in routine physical security audits. Insurance providers and risk assessors will start requiring proof of airspace monitoring, just as they do for cybersecurity today. Airspace intelligence will become a built-in layer of enterprise security infrastructure. Counter-drone sensors will integrate into real-time awareness systems that unify land, air, and perimeter data into a single operational picture. Building automation, access control, and video analytics platforms will all ingest airspace telemetry as a standard data stream, giving enterprises continuous visibility from the ground to the sky. What changes inside the enterprise: • Airspace security added to compliance checklists for insurance and risk audits. • Integration into real-time awareness systems connecting land, air, and perimeter monitoring. • APIs and interoperability standards emerging across physical security, building automation, and video analytics platforms. Prediction 3: The Great Convergence of Positive and Protective Airspace Public safety agencies and enterprises will no longer separate “drone use” from “drone defense.” DFR fleets, delivery operators, and counter-UAS systems will operate within a shared airspace layer where detection, authorization, and deconfliction happen automatically. Airspace awareness will evolve into a common operating picture, connecting public safety, commercial, and enterprise users through shared data and trust protocols. This will blur the line between response and protection—enabling legitimate missions while automatically isolating unknown or unsafe flights. Prediction 4: The Sky Gets Low Altitude Highways Governments and industry will begin establishing structured drone corridors — fixed routes in the low-altitude airspace that function like highways for autonomous flight. The first versions will appear near major metro areas and logistics hubs, coordinated between the FAA, state authorities, and major operators like Amazon, Wing, and Zipline. Each corridor will rely on integrated UTM and counter-UAS technology to manage traffic and prevent incursions. Over time, these drone highways will form a national low-altitude transportation grid, complete with right-of-way rules, altitude tiers, and enforcement mechanisms — the foundation for safe, scalable drone operations in shared airspace. Drone Usage: Drone as First Responder, Delivery, Inspection and More Prediction 5: Drones Become Standard Equipment for Law Enforcement Drones will evolve from a specialized resource into standard patrol gear. Every officer or patrol vehicle will have a small, easily deployable drone for close-quarters and indoor operations—giving officers immediate eyes on a scene during building searches and other confined-space incidents. At the same time, dock-based patrol drones will handle the majority of calls for service and situational awareness. These highly automated systems will launch, recharge, and redeploy on their own, providing continuous overwatch and rapid response across an agency’s coverage area. Together, they will deliver layered aerial support that shortens response times and extends visibility without adding personnel. Prediction 6: Shared Air Support Across Agencies Public safety agencies will begin pooling Drone as First Responder (DFR) resources into local airspace networks. Cloud-based tasking, shared flight zones, and unified command dashboards will let police, fire, and EMS access the same docked drone fleets across neighboring jurisdictions. AI-based flight management will enable one operator to supervise multiple drones simultaneously across active incidents, extending real-time coverage citywide without adding staff. Expect the first public-private DFR consortiums to emerge, delivering local mutual-aid coverage for emergencies, pursuits, and natural disasters. Prediction 7: Part 108 Opens the Skies and Drives the Need for Integrated Airspace Management In 2026, the US FAA will finalize Part 108, unlocking routine BVLOS operations and fuelling mass drone adoption across delivery, inspection, and DFR programs. The rule will clarify right-of-way responsibilities and legitimize autonomous flight at scale. Yet as more authorized drones take flight, airspace deconfliction and counter-UAS will become more critical than ever. Part 108 will expand the need for integrated airspace management, blending drone operations, UTM, and counter-UAS into one connected ecosystem. Additionally, these new standards in the US will encourage other countries to follow suit. The EU, UK, and Australia will begin harmonizing around similar right-of-way and BVLOS standards to enable commercial drone corridors. Global companies like Amazon, UPS, and Zipline will demand consistent counter-UAS frameworks at the same time, creating new opportunities for exportable airspace-security tech. Defense CUAS Prediction 8: UAS Types & Usage Shifts In 2026, the concept of “airspace defense” will expand into multi-domain defense of uncrewed systems, transforming how militaries and public safety agencies think about threat detection and response. Expect increased operational use of Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs), all of which are capable of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and payload delivery missions within their respective operational environments. Micro-sized drones, including insect-like “cybugs” and bio-hybrid platforms, will move from prototype to field testing, offering near-undetectable capabilities for espionage, sabotage, or facility infiltration. Simultaneously, nations will accelerate investment in autonomous or semi-autonomous interceptor drones designed to disable or capture hostile drones in midair, bridging the gap between electronic warfare that disrupts signals and traditional kinetic countermeasures. These will include net-based, kinetic, and energy-based systems, purpose-built to operate safely over populated or sensitive areas. As RF-based defenses become ubiquitous, adversaries will shift toward RF-silent and fully autonomous drones, rendering legacy RF-controlled systems obsolete. Prediction 9: Defense Primes Will Begin to Operate with More of a Startup Mindset Long development timelines and proprietary hardware / software will become increasingly unacceptable to defense customers. With speed to field becoming a procurement requirement, traditional defense primes will begin to operate more like startups, leveraging open architecture designs and making decisions to buy versus build more often. Prediction 10: Shift from CUAS “Air Walls” to Fully Networked & Integrated CUAS Systems Air walls which exist only at the border are no longer sufficient. We have seen that drones can be smuggled into a country while powered off and then take off once they are well past the air wall – in depth – conducting devastatingly effective missions. These incidents will not only push nations to expand their internal detection networks but also to form multi-country CUAS collaborations, beginning in Europe and later extending through NATO and Indo-Pacific partnerships. These networks will expand on the initial air wall concept by establishing comprehensive networked CUAS systems which exist not only at the border, but also deep within each country. These CUAS coalitions will leverage shared airspace intelligence protocols, enabling the exchange of drone signatures, RF telemetry, and incident data in real time. Prediction 11: AI-Mediated Engagement Decisions The next evolution of counter-UAS systems will pair AI decision-support with human oversight, mirroring missile-defense frameworks. Automated sensors and targeting algorithms will evaluate speed, flight path, and threat behavior to generate real-time “shoot/no-shoot” recommendations, placing humans on the loop rather than fully in control. This model will enable faster, safer responses in complex airspace and reduce the cognitive burden on operators managing multiple threats at once. Ethical and policy debates will intensify as militaries test the balance between automation and accountability in kinetic engagements. This year’s predictions highlight the rapid convergence of drone operations and airspace security. Public safety agencies are integrating drones into daily response. Enterprises are expanding their use of aerial data. Governments are redefining airspace policy while preparing for new classes of threats. Drones now serve every mission — and challenge every boundary. The next phase of airspace security is about managing coexistence and countering threats across defense, public safety, and enterprise domains. Boneyard Prediction 8: Airspace Defense Becomes Multi-Domain Defense The counter-drone mission will no longer be isolated to the air. In 2026, we’ll see increased use of underwater, surface, ground-based and micro-sized uncrewed systems, requiring integrated command and sensor layers across domains. • Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) used to surveil or conduct attacks on maritime vessels or infrastructure. • Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs) adapted for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and payload delivery missions. • Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) used for surveillance or to conduct attacks on maritime vessels or critical infrastructure. • Micro Uncrewed Vehicles such as Insect-sized “cybugs” and bio-hybrid drones will move from experimental to operational testing. Their small size, low heat output, and biological camouflage will make them nearly undetectable to conventional sensors, enabling new forms of espionage, sabotage, and infiltration inside secure facilities Prediction 9: Rise of ‘Drone-on-Drone’ Interceptors Expect an explosion of interceptor drone programs — autonomous or semi-autonomous UAS designed to physically disable or capture hostile drones midair. They will bridge the gap between “soft kill” electronic measures and conventional firepower. Methods will include net-based, kinetic, and energy-based interceptors that can operate safely over populated areas. Prediction 10: Radio Frequency (RF) Controlled Drones Will Become Obsolete on the Battlefield As RF-based counter-drone technology is fully integrated at the tactical edge, adversaries will all but abandon traditional RF controlled drones, instead focusing on RF-silent, autonomous technology.

Title: AI Stands for Accidental Innovation

LAST UPDATED: December 29, 2025 at 12:49 PM GUEST POST from Art Inteligencia In the world of corporate strategy, we love to manufacture myths of inevitable visionary genius. We look at the behemoths of today and assume their current dominance was etched in stone a decade ago by a leader who could see through the fog of time. But as someone who has spent a career studying Human-Centered Innovation and the mechanics of innovation, I can tell you that the reality is often much messier. And this is no different when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), so much so that it could be said that AI stands for Accidental Innovation. Take, for instance, the meteoric rise of Nvidia. Today, they are the undisputed architects of the intelligence age, a company whose hardware powers the Large Language Models (LLMs) reshaping our world. Yet, if we pull back the curtain, we find a story of survival, near-acquisitions, and a heavy dose of serendipity. Nvidia didn’t build their current empire because they predicted the exact nuances of the generative AI explosion; they built it because they were lucky enough to have developed technology for a completely different purpose that happened to be the perfect fuel for the AI fire. — Braden Kelley It is difficult to imagine now, but there was a point in the Future Present where Nvidia was seen as a vulnerable hardware player. In the mid-2010s, as the Virtual Reality (VR) hype began to peak, Nvidia’s focus was heavily tethered to the gaming market. Internal histories and industry whispers suggest that the Oculus division of Meta (then Facebook) explored the idea of acquiring or deeply merging with Nvidia’s core graphics capabilities to secure their own hardware vertical. At the time, Nvidia’s valuation was a fraction of what it is today. Had that acquisition occurred, the “Corporate Antibodies” of a social media giant would likely have stifled the very modularity that makes Nvidia great today. Instead of becoming the generic compute engine for the world, Nvidia might have been optimized—and narrowed—into a specialized silicon shop for VR headsets. It was a sliding doors moment for the entire tech industry. By not being acquired, Nvidia maintained the autonomy to follow the scent of demand wherever it led next. Before the “Magnificent Seven” era, Nvidia was struggling to find its next big act beyond PC gaming. When Meta acquired Oculus, there was a desperate need for low-latency, high-performance GPUs to make VR viable. The relationship between the two companies was so symbiotic that some analysts argued a vertical integration was the only logical step. Had Mark Zuckerberg moved more aggressively to bring Nvidia under the Meta umbrella, the GPU might have become a proprietary tool for the Metaverse. Because this deal failed to materialize, Nvidia remained an open ecosystem, allowing researchers at Google and OpenAI to eventually use that same hardware for a little thing called a Transformer model. The second major “accident” in Nvidia’s journey was the Cryptocurrency boom. For years, Nvidia’s stock and production cycles were whipped around by the price of Ethereum. To the outside world, this looked like a distraction—a volatile market that Nvidia was chasing to satisfy shareholders. However, the crypto miners demanded exactly what AI would later require: massive, parallel processing power and specialized chips (ASICs and high-end GPUs) that could perform simple calculations millions of times per second. Nvidia leaned into this demand, refining their CUDA platform and their manufacturing scale. They weren’t building for LLMs yet; they were building for miners. But in doing so, they solved the scalability problem of parallel computing. When the “AI Winter” ended and the industry realized that Deep Learning was the path forward, Nvidia didn’t have to invent a new chip. They just had to rebrand the one they had already perfected for the blockchain. Preparation met opportunity, but the opportunity wasn’t the one they had initially invited to the dance. In 2021, Nvidia’s primary concern was “Lite Hash Rate” (LHR) cards to deter crypto miners so gamers could finally buy GPUs. This era of forced scaling forced Nvidia to master the art of data-center-grade reliability. When ChatGPT arrived, the transition was seamless. The “Accidental Innovation” here was that the mathematical operations required to verify a block on a chain are fundamentally similar to the vector mathematics required to predict the next word in a sentence. Nvidia had built the world’s best token-prediction machine while thinking they were building the world’s best ledger-validation machine. While Nvidia currently sits on the throne of Accidental Innovation, the next wave of change-makers is already emerging by attempting to turn that accident into a deliberate architecture. Cerebras Systems is building “wafer-scale” engines that dwarf traditional GPUs, aiming to eliminate the networking bottlenecks that Nvidia’s “accidental” legacy still carries. Groq (not to be confused with the AI model) is focusing on LPU (Language Processing Units) that prioritize the inference speed necessary for real-time human interaction. In the software layer, Modular is working to decouple the AI software stack from specific hardware, potentially neutralizing Nvidia’s CUDA moat. Finally, keep an eye on CoreWeave, which has pivoted from crypto mining to become a specialized “AI cloud,” proving that Nvidia’s accidental path is a blueprint others can follow by design. We must stop teaching innovation as a series of deliberate masterstrokes. When we do that, we discourage leaders from experimenting. If you believe you must see the entire future before you act, you will stay paralyzed. Nvidia’s success is a testament to Agile Resilience. They built a powerful, flexible tool, stayed independent during a crucial acquisition window, and were humble enough to let the market show them what their technology was actually good for. As we move into this next phase of the Future Present, the lesson is clear: don’t just build for the world you see today. Build for the accidents of tomorrow. Because in the end, the most impactful innovations are rarely the ones we planned; they are the ones we were ready for.

Title: Silver’s Sharp Plunge: Bitcoin-Style Flash Crash or Healthy Pullback Before $100?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Basius77 / Shutterstock.com In 2025, silver surged to record highs, topping $80 per ounce and briefly reaching $84 before retreating. Starting the year around $29 per ounce, the metal has delivered gains of over 160%, outperforming gold, stocks, and most asset classes. This rally has drawn parallels to Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), which earlier surged past $126,000 amid predictions of $200,000 or more, fueling a buying frenzy. However, Bitcoin suffered a flash crash on Oct. 10, triggered by leverage deleveraging and broader market stress, leading to over $19 billion in liquidations and a more than 30% drop from highs. Silver followed a similar path, with traders eyeing momentum to carry it past $100 per ounce. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV), the largest silver ETF, closed at a high of $71.12 per share on Dec 26 while silver peaked at $83.62 — just before profit-taking and margin hikes sent it down over 11% to around $73 per ounce this morning. Investors now question if silver will mirror Bitcoin’s plunge. Bitcoin’s flash crash stemmed from high leverage in a thin market, amplified by political shocks like tariff threats that created a risk-off environment. Over $19 billion in positions were liquidated in hours, driven by overleveraged traders and whale panic-selling near highs. Unlike prior cycles with retail dominance, 2025 saw institutional participation, yet its correlation with equities strengthened, exposing crypto to broader risk-off moves. Bitcoin could face further downside if macroeconomic pressures persist, such as delayed rate cuts or trade tensions rising again. Its value relies heavily on sentiment and adoption expectations, lacking the tangible utility backing other assets and even other cryptocurrencies. While long-term potential exists from institutional and potential government interest, short-term volatility remains high without any physical demand to anchor it. Silver’s recent 11% drop echoes Bitcoin’s volatility, raising fears of a deeper correction. Profit-taking after record highs, margin hikes on the Comex Metals Exchange (CME), and year-end positioning contributed to the pullback. However, silver’s fundamentals differ markedly from Bitcoin’s speculative base. Silver’s primary driver is industrial use, which accounts for over half of demand. Applications in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, and AI infrastructure continue growing. Solar alone consumes a significant share, with global installations pushing consumption higher despite efficiency improvements. U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 enhanced silver’s appeal, as they made buying less risky in a rate-easing environment. That offered support for the rally alongside ETF inflows and central bank buying. Most critical is silver’s structural deficit. The market has faced consecutive annual shortfalls, with 2025 estimates around 115 million to 120 million ounces unmet by mine production. Supply remains inelastic — silver is largely a byproduct of other mining — and recycling covers only a portion. Inventories in major vaults have shrunk, tightening physical availability. Unlike Bitcoin, whose supply is algorithmic and based on perceptions of its value, silver has intrinsic industrial utility. This physical backing provides support that is absent in crypto, limiting downside risk even during dips. Further pullbacks are possible — even likely — en route to higher levels, as volatility persists and the speculative froth surrounding the white metal unwinds. Yet the supply-demand imbalance favors sustained upside beyond current records. The iShares Silver Trust offers investors the most efficient way to gain silver exposure. Backed by physical bullion held in vaults, it avoids the storage, insurance, and assay costs of owning coins or bars. As the largest silver ETF managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), it provides liquidity and direct price tracking. Surface parallels to Bitcoin’s crash may spark caution, but silver’s structural support — rooted in irreplaceable industrial demand and ongoing deficits — sets it apart. The 2025 run-up included more than a dash of irrational exuberance, yet silver’s underlying fundamentals point to further gains and higher highs ahead.

BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund has distributed $100 million from Treasury yields, offering a real-world test of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s first tokenized money market fund has paid out $100 million in cumulative dividends since its launch, highlighting the growing real-world use of tokenized securities amid rising institutional adoption. The milestone for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) was announced Monday by Securitize, which serves as the fund’s issuer and tokenization partner, overseeing onchain issuance and investor onboarding. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL was initially issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The fund invests in short-term, US dollar–denominated assets, including US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and cash equivalents, offering institutional investors a blockchain-based vehicle to earn yield while maintaining liquidity. Investors purchase BUIDL tokens pegged to the US dollar and receive dividend distributions directly onchain, reflecting income generated from the underlying assets. Since its debut on Ethereum, BUIDL has expanded to additional blockchains, including Solana, Aptos, Avalanche and Optimism. The $100 million milestone is notable because it represents lifetime payouts derived from actual Treasury yields distributed to holders of onchain fund tokens. It demonstrates that tokenized securities can operate at scale while mirroring the core functions of traditional financial products. The development also underscores the operational efficiencies enabled by blockchain technology, including faster settlement, transparent ownership records and programmable distributions, features that are increasingly drawing interest from large asset managers and institutional investors exploring tokenized real-world assets. BUIDL, in particular, has seen strong adoption, with the value of the tokenized fund surpassing $2 billion earlier this year. Related: Fragmentation drains up to $1.3B a year from tokenized assets: Report Tokenized money market funds have quickly emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the onchain RWA market, and for good reason. Their appeal lies in their ability to deliver money market–style returns with greater operational efficiency, a dynamic that has begun to draw attention from traditional financial institutions. Some market participants view these products as a potential counterweight to the anticipated growth of stablecoins. In July, JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho said tokenized money market funds preserve the longstanding appeal of “cash as an asset,” even as regulatory developments such as the approval of the GENIUS Act were expected to accelerate stablecoin adoption and potentially erode the role of cash-like instruments. Despite their rapid growth, tokenized money market funds have also attracted industry scrutiny. The Bank for International Settlements recently warned that such products could introduce operational and liquidity risks, particularly as they become an increasingly important source of collateral within the digital asset ecosystem.

Title: The dollar has been the weakest major currency in 2025. Here's what that means for everyday Americans.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a weak run for the buck. The US dollar has declined against all of its main global peers in 2025, and the Dollar Index — which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — is down 10% this year. There have been multiple catalysts for the decrease, none more prevalent than the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates multiple times. Generally speaking, when a central bank lowers rates, holding a currency becomes less attractive. There's also the matter of President Trump's proposed tariff policies, which particularly roiled markets in the first half of 2025. Investors viewed his potential levies as negative for growth and a source of uncertainty, both of which were dollar-negative. But let's not get too doom-and-gloom about a weak dollar. There are positives too. Detailed below are the two pros and two cons of a depreciating currency: A weaker US currency offers other countries more purchasing power, which can boost exports and economic growth. It can also support US industries that depend heavily on exports, like manufacturing and agriculture. The US exported $125 billion more goods and services in the nine months leading up to September than it did the same period last year, the Census Bureau said this month, an increase of 5%. President Donald Trump pointed out the benefits of a weaker dollar when speaking to the press in July, suggesting that the US could "make a hell of a lot more money" when the greenback was weak. "When we have a strong dollar, one thing happens: It sounds good. But you don't do any tourism. You can't sell tractors, you can't sell trucks, you can't sell anything," he said at the White House. "Pushing down the dollar's value has been a policy priority for the administration as it sought in part to make exports more attractive," Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, wrote in a note on Monday. There are also positive implications for the labor market. If export-heavy industries like manufacturing and agriculture are thriving, that can create more jobs. A boost to international sales is inherently good news for US firms that sell goods abroad. That applies to most of the S&P 500, where foreign sales are significant for at least half of the index's companies, Hogan said. "I would say the pros and cons for corporate America are more tailwinds than headwinds," he added. After the US dollar recorded its worst first half of the year in nearly half a century, Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, said the bank believed a weaker greenback was an underappreciated "tailwind" from an earnings perspective. "There's no doubt that a weaker dollar is part of the story for why revision factors have continued to move — even faster recovery than we had expected," he said, speaking to CNBC earlier in the year. A cheaper dollar could also be a boon for unhedged international equities, or shares of international stocks in local currencies, BlackRock said in a recent client note. That's partly because foreign firms are gaining purchasing power as their local currencies strengthen against the greenback. On the other hand, a weaker currency in the US can translate to higher prices for US consumers of imported goods, or goods with imported parts. That adds to inflationary pressures that already hang in the background with Trump's tariffs. Consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November — below what economists expected, but still above the Fed's long-run 2% inflation target. "For everyday Americans, the story is a bit opposite," Hogan said. "The buying power of your dollar goes down as the value of the dollar goes down against the basket of other currencies. So it does make it harder to keep up with higher cost of goods." Americans on vacation could also facing higher costs, as a weaker dollar has less purchasing power abroad, Hogan added. On the flip side, it also makes the US more attractive as a tourist destination for foreigners, who have gained purchasing power. "There's puts and takes," he said. "If you're planning that European vacation, it's going to cost you a bit more in that currency translation." Jump to

Title: If You Invested $10,000 in Nvidia 10 Years Ago, Here’s How Much You Would Have Today

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, powering much of the infrastructure behind generative AI and data centers. This demand propelled its market capitalization to $4.5 trillion, supported by a roughly 39% year-to-date gain in its stock price. Yet concerns persist about increasing competition from rivals and a potential slowdown in AI spending, raising fears of an AI bubble burst. While the stock’s performance may feel disappointing to some investors after explosive gains in prior years, a near-40% return would have been phenomenal for Nvidia 10 years ago. But had you had the foresight to invest $10,000 in the stock in early January 2016 and hold through today, the results tell a remarkable story of transformation. It is important to see where Nvidia came from over the past decade to understand where it stands today. In early 2016, Nvidia primarily focused on graphics processing units for PC gaming. Its GeForce lineup dominated the market for video game graphics accelerators, delivering high-performance visuals for gamers. The company generated record annual revenue in fiscal 2016, largely from its gaming segment, which accounted for about three quarters of the total. At the time, AI applications remained in their infancy and had not yet entered the public consciousness as a viable technology for changing industry and the world around us. Back then, Nvidia’s data center business was small, generating only $339 million for all of 2015. The stock traded at split-adjusted prices around $0.80 per share as the new year began, accounting for subsequent splits, including the 4-for-1 split in 2021 and the 10-for-1 split in 2024. Nvidia’s evolution accelerated in the late 2010s. The metaverse was a thing for 15 minutes until cryptocurrency mining surged between 2017 and 2018, with miners using Nvidia GPUs for proof-of-work algorithms in coins like Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). This drove unexpected demand, boosting gaming segment revenue despite volatility — Nvidia noted crypto’s contributions but maintained its focus on its core gaming GPUs. As crypto mining waned after several market crashes, Nvidia shifted toward AI and deep learning. Researchers had used its GPUs for machine learning since the early 2010s, and the company released products like the DGX-1 in 2016 for AI training. Explosive growth in generative AI after 2022 — ChatGPT was released in late November that year the public began to take notice — cemented Nvidia as the premier AI chipmaker, with its data center segment now dominating. Nvidia’s revenue transformation has been just as dramatic. Where 2016 annual revenue stood at $5 billion, Nvidia reported $57 billion in revenue for just the third quarter of fiscal 2026 — exceeding the entire 2016 yearly figure tenfold in just three months. Its stock price growth mirrored this shift. From those penny-per-share split-adjusted levels near January 2016, Nvidia is currently trading above $187 per share today. This represents a price appreciation of over 23,600%. Considering Nvidia’s entire market cap was about $17 billion a decade ago, it’s not surprising to learn you would be sitting on a not-so-small fortune with it priced at $4.5 trillion. But how big is big? Over the last 10 years, Nvidia’s total return — yes, the chipmaker pays a nominal dividend yielding 0.02% — would have turned a $10,000 investment in early January 2016 into more than $2.37 million. This performance underscores Nvidia’s successful pivot from gaming to AI leadership, turning early investors into millionaires despite the occasional downturn. It’s why you should buy stocks with the idea of never selling them, and holding on through periods of volatility. It’s not necessary that all your stocks perform like Nvidia, as just one monster homerun swing can set you up for life. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

UPDATED 11:05 EST / DECEMBER 29 2025 by Kyt Dotson Seoul-based financial firm Mirae Asset Financial Group is considering buying Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit Inc., the Korea Times reported today. The Korean cryptocurrency market is dominated by Upbit and Bithumb, which represent over 95% of the exchange volume in the country. As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Korbit serves as an entry point for Mirae into the cryptocurrency industry, which has traditionally focused on traditional finance since its founding in the late 1990s. Founded in 2013, Korbit, also known as 코빗 (Ko-bit) in Korean, began as Korea’s first cryptocurrency exchange, pioneering bitcoin trading in Korean won. Although it opened the market to the local population and paved the way for early trading infrastructure, it was quickly surpassed by the larger exchanges. Today, it still remains a key player in the market. Officials at Mirae said the company is in talks to acquire a 60.5% stake in Kobit from its parent company, NXC Corp., the exchange’s largest shareholder, and a 31.5% from SK Planet. NXC is the family holding group that owns a controlling stake in major South Korea-based global video game giant Nexon Co. Ltd., a developer and publisher known for games like MapleStory and Dungeon Fighter Online. The deal is estimated at up to 140 billion won, around $97.5 million total. The purchase would be led by Mirae Asset Consulting, the group’s real estate and consulting affiliate controlled by founder Park Hyeon-joo and his wife. Mirae offers asset management, wealth management, investment banking and insurance. Since its founding, it established itself as a prominent leader in traditional finance. An unnamed industry official quoted by the Korea Times noted that Park, now global strategy officer, previously emphasized exploring business opportunities that interconnect traditional finance to digital assets. “Korbit has historically had a limited presence, but Mirae Asset Financial Group’s decades of expertise could allow it to pursue a differentiated strategy,” he added. The purchase could shift the current nature of Korea’s cryptocurrency and digital asset landscape. Kobit maintains a large number of regulatory licenses in the country. The acquisition news follows increasing outreach throughout the global market by major financial firms, including MasterCard Inc., multinational investment management firm BlackRock Inc. and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc.

December 29, 2025 10:38 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA News Group News Commentary – The counter-unmanned aircraft system market is projected to reach $20.31 billion by 2030, growing from $6.64 billion in 2025 at a 25.1% compound annual growth rate, driven by accelerating threats from hostile drones across military and critical infrastructure domains[1]. The Space Development Agency awarded $3.5 billion in contracts this month for 72 missile tracking satellites designed to detect hypersonic threats from low Earth orbit, signaling the Pentagon's pivot toward integrated deterrence architectures that prioritize space-based sensing and autonomous response systems[2]. This convergence of orbital surveillance and tactical edge protection drives the investment thesis for VisionWave Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV), and BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI). The military unmanned systems market is projected to reach $76.05 billion by 2035 from $28.02 billion in 2025, reflecting a 10.5% annual growth rate fueled by Department of Defense mandates for multi-domain autonomous platforms[3]. The AI in defense sector is expected to surge from $12.55 billion in 2024 to $178.14 billion by 2034 at a 30.38% compound annual growth rate[4], as battlefield commanders demand machine-speed decision frameworks capable of countering hypersonic missiles, drone swarms, and contested space environments. VisionWave Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV) recently completed the acquisition of Solar Drone Ltd., an autonomous robotics company and subsidiary of BladeRanger, marking the defense technology developer's first acquisition since its July 2025 public listing. The transaction closed through a Share Purchase Agreement involving 1,800,000 shares of common stock, positioning VisionWave to address defense applications alongside the solar operations and maintenance robotics market. “The completion of the Solar Drone acquisition marks an important inflection point for VisionWave,” said Douglas Davis, Executive Chairman of VisionWave. “This is not a standalone asset, but a platform capability that strengthens our autonomous robotics roadmap across defense, security, and critical infrastructure. We believe Solar Drone may accelerate our ability to deploy intelligent, mission-ready systems at scale.” The acquisition provides VisionWave with access to autonomous systems designed for critical infrastructure monitoring across more than 165 GW of installed U.S. utility-scale solar capacity and over 260 GW in Europe. Solar Drone completed a 100-day Proof of Concept with DB InfraGO AG through DB mindbox, with DB InfraGO AG recommending advancement to discussions with Sky Operations, DB Services, and DB Energie departments. The company's autonomous robotics capabilities complement VisionWave's development of Unmanned Ground Vehicle platforms and counter-drone systems designed for defense and security applications. The integration of Solar Drone's technologies supports VisionWave's strategy to deliver autonomous solutions across multiple operational domains. VisionWave initiated the patent application process for a planned series of patents covering key technologies underlying Argus, the company's space-enabled, AI-driven counter-unmanned aircraft system developed in collaboration with BladeRanger. The intellectual property strategy targets Argus's core architecture including the SkyWeave high-frequency communications backbone, space and ground-based drone detection methods, and end-to-end decision frameworks for detection, classification, tracking, and engagement. Additional filings are expected to address HF-enabled sensor fusion, multi-layer control logic, and secure encryption mechanisms optimized for contested environments. VisionWave announced a non-binding letter of intent with Evie Autonomous Limited to explore a £500,000 Proof-of-Concept program integrating autonomous vehicle technology into VisionWave's Unmanned Ground Vehicle platforms. The POC program targets advanced navigation and multi-sensor fusion capabilities for the Varan UGV platform unveiled in November 2025, with discussions anticipated to continue into 2026 pending definitive agreements. The partnership discussions align with VisionWave's expansion of its London-based UGV research and development engineering team. VisionWave's acquisition strategy and technology development initiatives position the company to address defense, security, and commercial markets through a multi-domain autonomy approach spanning counter-UAS systems, autonomous ground vehicles, and industrial robotics applications.

The platform-agnostic directed-energy systems integrate seamlessly with Army command-and-control architectures across fixed-site base defense and multiple maneuverable platforms. AeroVironment continues scaling manufacturing to meet growing demand for counter-UAS capabilities across defense applications. BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI) has announced a strategic partnership with C Speed, LLC, integrating its ConductorOS AI platform with C Speed's LightWave Radar system to deliver autonomous threat detection for border security and defense applications. The collaboration targets multiple Department of Homeland Security, Department of War, and international partner missions, with C Speed's American-made radars currently deployed across both aerostat-based and tower-based solutions. BigBear.ai expects to leverage its expanding presence across global markets, including the Middle East from its new Abu Dhabi office, to support deployment of the integrated system. "Securing complex borders and high-consequence environments requires intelligent systems that can sense, understand, and respond at machine speed," said Kevin McAleenan, CEO of BigBear.ai. "Our partnership with C Speed brings more secure, mission-ready AI directly to the edge, advancing situational awareness, automation, and officer support for the most demanding national security missions." The integrated solution enables AI-driven sensor fusion for counter-UAS operations and real-time autonomous mode switching between airborne, ground, and maritime threats. Both companies are targeting growth across U.S. Customs and Border Protection, national security, and critical defense missions.

Title: Can You Really Grow in 2026 if You Aren’t Tapping into AI Budget?

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai, Scale Can you really grow in B2B in 2026 if you aren’t tapping into AI budget? The short answer: Probably not. Here’s the real data. It may in fact be your last, best change to tap into it. Something fundamentally different happened in 2025. AI budgets stopped being “innovation fund” line items and became core IT spending. And in 2026? They’re becoming the only growth budget that matters. AI is the growth engine not just of software, but the entire U.S. (and beyond) economy. Let discuss what’s actually happening—with real numbers from the companies winning right now. Here’s the eye-opening stat from Andreessen Horowitz’s survey of 100 enterprise CIOs: Enterprise leaders expect an average of ~75% growth in LLM budgets over the next year. And as one CIO put it: “What I spent in 2023 I now spend in a week.” But here’s what really matters for B2B founders: Last year, innovation budgets made up 25% of LLM spending. That’s now dropped to just 7%. AI has graduated from experiment to core operating expense. What does that mean practically? According to ISG’s research, while overall IT budgets are rising just 1.8% (basically inflation), AI spending is increasing 5.7%—with nearly a quarter of enterprises planning 10%+ increases. AI is now capturing 30% of the total IT budget increase despite being a fraction of overall spend. Gartner forecasts global AI spending will approach $1.5 trillion in 2025, with enterprise software and infrastructure alone hitting nearly $500 billion in 2026. Meanwhile, worldwide IT spending will grow 9.8% to exceed $6 trillion for the first time—but software specifically is projected to grow 15.2% year-over-year. Here’s the brutal math for B2B companies: So where do they find budget for AI initiatives? They steal it from somewhere else. The question is: Are you going to be stealing budget? Or getting stolen from? Your Job In AI + B2B in 2026: Grab The Tailwinds, For Real. It’s Not Too Late. But It’s Different. Want to see what happens when you tap into AI budget vs. when you don’t? Just look at the public markets this year. The Winners (AI-Native or AI Infrastructure): The Losers (Traditional SaaS, SMB-Focused, or “Added AI”): That’s a 4.7x difference in valuation multiple between high-growth AI companies and slow-growth traditional SaaS. The market is telling us something. The Great B2B Bifurcation of 2025: Why Some SaaS Stocks Are Up 142% While Others Are Down 51% Palantir’s story is remarkable. Revenue growth bottomed at 12.7% in Q2 2023—the exact quarter they launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform). By H1 2025, revenue was up 44% year-over-year, with $541 million in net income (up 125%). The company’s Q3 showed what AI-native means financially: 63% revenue growth with 51% operating margins.Their Rule of 68 score (growth rate plus operating margin) is exceptional. Free cash flow crossed $1 billion trailing twelve months. Palantir’s CTO Shyam Sankar captures the thesis: “The models are converging while pricing for inference is dropping significantly. This only strengthens our conviction that the value is in the application and workflow layer.” The lesson? Don’t add AI to existing products. Build AI operating systems from scratch. ServiceNow’s Q3 2025 shattered expectations with $3.41 billion in revenue, up 22% year-over-year. Their AI-related Annual Contract Value is approaching $500 million, and they’re targeting $1 billion in AI-specific revenue in 2026. What’s working? They’re not just adding chatbots. They’re shipping autonomous AI agents that resolve complex IT outages and HR requests without human intervention. The “Xanadu” and “Yokohama” platform releases introduced agents that execute tasks, not just suggest answers. CEO Bill McDermott calls it the “enterprise nerve center.” The TAM for ServiceNow is expanding to $275 billion by 2026 as they move beyond IT into AI-powered customer service, HR, and cross-enterprise workflows. MongoDB was left for dead in August 2025, trading at $214 with sentiment at rock bottom. Then came Q3: Atlas growth accelerated to 30% YoY, FCF jumped 306% to $140 million, and guidance was raised to $2.43-2.44 billion. Why the turnaround? AI applications deal with messy, unstructured data—exactly what document databases handle well. As Menlo Ventures noted: “The companies winning in 2025 are infrastructure plays (Palantir, MongoDB, Cloudflare, Snowflake) rather than application plays.” Infrastructure benefits from AI. Applications get disrupted by it. MongoDB: The Great(est) AI Turnaround Story of 2025 Marc Benioff went all-in on agents, and Q3 showed signs it’s working. Agentforce now serves 18,500 enterprise customers (up from 12,500 last quarter), running more than 3 billion automated workflows monthly and pushing past $540 million in ARR from agentic products. They added 6,000 new enterprise customers in one quarter for Agentforce—while everyone else was talking about an AI bubble. Current remaining performance obligations are up 15% (versus 10% estimates). The Futurum Group placed Salesforce at the top of its agentic AI platform rankings, slightly ahead of Microsoft. That matters for 2026. CrowdStrike is up 51% YTD despite a major outage in July 2024. Why? Security spending is non-discretionary. CIOs told Morgan Stanley they expect cybersecurity spending to grow 50% faster than overall software spending. Their Falcon platform now includes endpoint, cloud workload, identity, and SIEM. 49% of customers use 6+ modules.Q3 showed subscription revenue up 21% to $1.17 billion, with net new ARR of $265 million (up 73% YoY). Their AI SIEM business grew 95% in 2025. The ambitious target: $20 billion ARR by fiscal year 2036. HubSpot fell from $880 to $370—a 51% decline—making it the worst-performing major B2B stock of 2025. The irony? The business is actually performing fine: Q2 revenue hit $760.9 million (up 19.4%), and they raised full-year guidance to $3.08 billion. The problem is perception. The market is pricing in maximum AI disruption risk for SMB-focused horizontal SaaS. When AI can potentially reduce the need for human marketing and sales users, seat-based pricing becomes a liability. HubSpot launched Breeze AI in September 2024, including customer agents, prospecting agents, and content agents. But as Benioff acknowledged about Salesforce, agents could be “a victim of their own success”—if agents reduce the need for human users, you sell fewer seats. The challenge for 2026: How do you monetize AI when your customers expect AI features without paying extra? Look at the broader pattern: HubSpot (-51%), Monday.com (-36%), Atlassian (-34%), Asana (struggling). These are all horizontal tools for broad use cases. Meanwhile, vertical solutions with deep domain expertise are defensible: Veeva for life sciences, Guidewire for insurance, Procore for construction. The lesson: Horizontal tools are under pressure. Vertical solutions with domain expertise have moats. According to Market Clarity’s analysis of Gartner data: The PwC survey of 308 US senior executives found: This isn’t tech companies only. It’s across all industries. Gartner: Enterprise Software Spend Will Grow a Stunning 15.2% Next Year. But Most Of That Will Go to Price Increases and AI Apps The winners in 2025—Palantir, Cursor, Gamma—didn’t “add AI.” They are AI companies that solve specific problems. The architecture is different. The economics are different. The customer expectation is different. Gamma reached $100M ARR profitably with just 50 people. That’s $2M ARR per employee. They’re competing against PowerPoint, which was invented before the first website existed. AI enables you to compete in markets that seemed settled—but you need to be 10x better, not 10% better. According to Iconiq Capital, AI-native companies show superior burn efficiency: For companies under $100M ARR, AI-native burns 0.4x their net new ARR, while median burns 2.0x. This advantage compounds over time. Rule #3: Some / Most Consumption-Based or Outcome-Based Pricing Really Helps Seat-based pricing made sense when software helped humans do their jobs better. Consumption-based or outcome-based pricing makes sense when AI does the job instead. HubSpot is moving toward credits-based pricing for Breeze Customer Agent. This transition will define who survives the next phase. Leaders like Cursor, Replit, etc. have per seat pricing at their core. But the majority of their revenue in many cases, or a large portion of it, comes from usage beyond the monthly fee. That’s not practical for pre-AI SaaS applications. But if you add so much value with your AI Agent, it just might make sense there. Every winner solves problems that enterprises literally cannot deprioritize: Let me give you the honest answer based on all this data: If you’re infrastructure: You’ll likely grow regardless, but AI workloads are accelerating that growth significantly. If you’re mission-critical (security, data, compliance): AI is adding to your growth, not replacing it. Budget is flowing your direction. If you’re horizontal SaaS with seat-based pricing: You’re fighting headwinds. Every customer expects AI features but doesn’t want to pay more. Meanwhile, AI-native startups are attacking your TAM with 6x your efficiency. If you’re vertical SaaS with domain expertise: AI is an opportunity to deepen your moat. Domain-specific AI is defensible in ways horizontal AI is not. If you’re SMB-focused: The market is pricing in maximum disruption risk. You need to prove AI enhances your value rather than cannibalizes it. The bottom line: 76% of AI use cases are now purchased rather than built internally. Enterprise buyers want ready-made AI solutions. AI buyers convert at 47% vs. SaaS’ 25%, indicating AI delivers enough immediate value to short-circuit standard procurement. The companies capturing this budget in 2026 will be the ones who built AI-native from day one—or successfully transformed before the window closed. The window is closing.

Title: Entertainment and Media Layoffs Up 18% With Over 17,000 Jobs Slashed in 2025

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A wave of consolidation, AI-driven change and cost-cutting pushed entertainment and media layoffs sharply higher in 2025 After a slight dip in layoffs in 2024, the entertainment and media industry jobs suffered through another difficult year. In 2025, over 17,000 jobs were cut across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming in the first 11 months of the year. This figure was up 18% from last year, continuing a trend from the past few years as the industry has wrestled with consolidation and other pressures like the double strikes in 2023. News alone, including broadcast, digital and print, suffered 2,254 job cuts to date, 179 of which occurred in November, but for the year, cuts were down 50% from the 4,537 job losses announced during the same period last year. The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation, according to Challenger. This summer the FCC officially approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, leading to layoffs across the Paramount entertainment business. Disney laid off hundreds this year, as part of CEO Bob Iger’s 2023 initiative to cut costs amid an audience migration away from cable TV subscriptions to streaming platforms. A World Economic Forum survey also found that 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI’s ability to handle more more complicated tasks have led to companies cutting jobs, although the actual return on investment of AI tools has been disappointing. Correspondingly, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. As AI cements itself into everyday life, digital media companies struggle. Sites that relied heavily on SEO and search are having to adapt strategy, leading some to shutter, like Teen Vogue. Layoffs across Condé Nast and Penske-owned properties removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations as a result. And PBS lost federal funding under President Donald Trump, forcing it to cut 15% of its staff. These job losses underscore a more broadly weaker job market, with November seeing more than 71,000 layoffs overall, the second highest over the last five years, behind only the 2022 cuts, according to said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Challenger also noted that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from year-end layoff announcements. From 2010 to 2017, the media industry lost 7,305 jobs per year on average, according to Challenger’s data. Since 2018, the average number of annual job cuts has jumped to 14,298. There is one industry in the entertainment business that is growing, though: the creator economy. As other industries shrink, the digital creator industry has only grown in 2025. From 2022 to 2024, L.A. employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, employment in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. The microdramas business has also grown this year, employing Hollywood production crews, nonunion actors and writers to create bite-sized, bingeable episodes that turn a profit. In just four years since the launch of these vertical dramas, the genre’s market has surpassed $8 billion globally, according to Media Partners Asia. Below is a look back at a grisly year that is increasingly becoming the norm for the news and entertainment industries. The entertainment industry suffered thousands of job losses this year as industry consolidation and contraction hit companies like Paramount, NBCUniversal, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. The FCC approved the Paramount-Skydance merger in July, placing the company under CEO David Ellison’s hands. During the last quarter of 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery reviewed bids to sell its holdings. It accepted Netflix’s offer, but Paramount has continued to put pressure on the company to accepts its bid. However the bidding war plays out, any deal will result in layoffs, although the timing could stretch into 2027. As Hollywood continues to lose out on productions to the U.K. due to incentives overseas and the rising cost of shooting in Los Angeles, the industry has also taken a hit. Some of the major job cuts to hit Hollywood this year included: Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal are each planning to spinoff their cable linear assets next year. With Comcast’s creation of Versant, NBCU laid off 7% of the workforce at NBC News and more employees from the television sector of the business, with Versant trading at the beginning of 2026. Under the leadership of Gunnar Wiedenfels, Warner Bros. will house its traditional TV networks under the independent “Global Networks” company. This split will go into effect later in 2026 under the accepted Netflix bid. Paramount is still pursuing the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, and said it expects to wring out $6 billion in merger-cost savings over the next three years. Analysts predicted at least 6,000 job losses, echoing Disney’s 2019 Fox acquisition downsizing. On-location production in the greater Los Angeles area, meanwhile, declined 13.2% from July through September compared to the same period last year, according to FilmLA. Only 157 theatrical films, television shows and movies, and streaming projects shot in Los Angeles County were completed and released in 2024. That’s down 14% from the 183 projects recorded in 2023 and the 228 recorded in 2022 amidst the production backlog caused by COVID. While Hollywood remains the leader in global film and TV production, the gap continues to steadily narrow while an estimated 41,000 entertainment jobs in Los Angeles have been lost over the past five years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “There are far fewer film projects being made in Los Angeles than there were in the recent past,” FilmLA Vice President of Communications Philip Sokoloski said. “Expanded options for attracting and retaining film jobs – as enacted this past July — are not only good for California’s economy, they are a critical form of protection for working families.” With the impending threat and continued implementation of AI in the newsroom, media companies have made tough decisions to best fit their financial needs and maintain relevancy. Several news organizations took hits as they pivot to keep up with audiences shortening attention spans and growing content sources. The cuts came amid a broader wave of layoffs throughout 2025. CBS News laid off about 100 people in October, weeks after NBC News laid off roughly 150 people. Condé Nast also cut multiple staffers last month through layoffs at Teen Vogue and the firings of four staffers who protested the cuts. Penske staffers suffered a wave of cuts at Variety, Rolling Stone and Billboard just weeks before the holidays. The layoffs at PMC organizations also come after the company removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations in October for those who would not comply. There was a distinct rise in AI-driven layoffs this year, with the technology accounting for nearly 55,000 job cuts, according to data from Challenger. Since its introduction, AI has offered to replace workers and perform the jobs of many at a lower cost, vastly changing how employers value their employees and how secure workers feel in their roles. Amazon laid off 14,000 employees in October. CEO Andy Jassy claimed the cuts were not necessarily driven by financial or AI factors though the company’s initial memo to staffers said the company needed to meet “this generation of AI.” Microsoft similarly cut 15,000 jobs throughout the year, providing a variety of explanations for the cuts. Both companies have invested heavily in AI tools. AI’s integration into the newsroom has not been seamless for all — see the Washington Post’s AI-generated news podcast — but media organizations are leaning into the technology as a tool to keep up and compete. New York became the first state to require employers to disclose when AI is the reason for layoffs this year as more companies seek the technology out as a way to increase work efficiency and potentially cut entry level roles. “Currently, AI aids news workers rather than replaces them, but there are no guarantees this will remain the case,” a report from Columbia University’s journalism school said earlier this year. “AI is sufficiently mature to enable the replacement of at least some journalism jobs, either directly or because fewer workers are needed.”

Title: Crypto Predictions for 2026: Top Analysts’ View

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Top crypto firms reveal their 2026 forecasts: BTC ATHs, stablecoin dominance, and tokenized assets take center stage as speculation gives way to real-world infrastructure. 2025 has been a wild ride for everyone who expected BTC $88 167 24h volatility: 1.1% Market cap: $1.76 T Vol. 24h: $39.81 B and major altcoins to hit new highs. We’re 3 days away from the New Year, volatility is still insane, the Fear and Greed index has been extreme for dozens of days, and most significant cryptocurrencies are trading well below their ATHs. However, prominent crypto moguls are slightly optimistic about 2026. We gathered the most significant predictions in one post, and yes, we want to come back here next December and find out if this time they were true. BlackRock’s 2026 outlook frames digital assets, especially stablecoins, as financial infrastructure for payments, settlement, and liquidity, rather than a pure speculative trade. The firm highlights the maturing role of dollar-pegged tokens in cross-border transfers and treasury flows. It argues that crypto’s most durable growth now sits beneath the surface in rails that interoperate with traditional finance. “Stablecoins are no longer niche — they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” says Samara Cohen, Global Head of Market Development at BlackRock. Grayscale’s annual outlook calls for Bitcoin to set a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. A DCG-owned investment group believes the Bitcoin price will be driven by clearer U.S. policy, rising institutional demand, and the fading dominance of the simple four-year halving cycle as macro liquidity and regulation take the wheel. The firm expects “rising valuations in 2026,” with institutions increasingly treating BTC as an allocatable portfolio asset. Grayscale’s 2026 Digital Asset Outlook is here with 10 themes marking the "Dawn of the Institutional Era." Our last 3 themes dive into what’s shaping crypto’s next phase in 2026. From Grayscale — the world’s largest digital asset-focused investment platform¹. Click below ⬇️ — Grayscale (@Grayscale) December 22, 2025 In its report, Coinbase Institutional says market structure, not narratives, will define 2026. The major crypto exchange expects the activity to concentrate on: Perpetual futures will anchor price discovery and command most trading volume. Leverage reset in late-2025 is seen as structural, not a retreat. Prediction markets will become a credible venue for information and risk transfer. It is worth noting that Coinbase plans its own push into the category. Stablecoins and payments will become crypto’s most persistent real-world use case. Coinbase models the stablecoin market cap at approximately $1.2 trillion by 2028. In its paper titled “26 Crypto, Bitcoin, DeFi, and AI Predictions for 2026“, Galaxy, same as BlackRock, focused on the real-world use cases. Stablecoins are forecast to process more volume than U.S. ACH and become core payment plumbing. Tokenized assets are expected to enter mainstream collateral and capital markets. Public chains will rethink value capture, with at least one L1 likely enshrining a revenue-generating app to feed its native token. In the meantime, the company thinks it’s too hard to predict the Bitcoin price, but it still sticks to its $250,000 forecast by the end of 2027. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest maintains a multi-year, institution-led BTC adoption thesis. They’ve maintained their 2030 scenario up to $2.4 million in the bull case and stepped up buying of crypto-exposed equities into year-end 2025. In a recent video for investors, Wood even says 2026 will be a Goldilocks year due to 0% inflation. Cathie Wood predicts 0% inflation by 2026 She says 2026 could be a Goldilocks year. After tariffs, shutdown risk, and hawkish Fed rhetoric, the market may be underestimating how close inflation could get to zero if oil and rents keep falling. pic.twitter.com/YeNlrsrlIr — Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) December 21, 2025 Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Could Bitcoin Replay Silver’s Rally… Backward? CEO Issues Warning

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Peter Schiff has warned that Bitcoin could suffer the opposite fate of silver after the metal posted a sudden, sharp rise. Based on reports, traders and analysts are debating whether the move in silver marks a broad shift back to real assets or a brief, crowded trade that may unwind quickly. According to trading data, silver jumped more than 10% in a single session and rose from about $78 to $79 in roughly ninety minutes. Spot silver climbed 18% last week to close at a record $79.31 on thin post-Christmas volume and its new status as a strategic metal. Reports have disclosed that this rally is being driven by a supply deficit and Washington’s decision to classify silver as a critical mineral, not by geopolitics or hopes for US rate cuts. A TradingView chart showed a near-vertical breakout, and a monthly RSI reading reached its highest level in 45 years, a sign of extreme momentum. What is happening with silver may soon be happening with Bitcoin, only in reverse. But since markets tend to melt down faster than they melt up, the time frame for the move should be condensed. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 27, 2025 Tokenized versions of metal assets have also gained ground. Based on reports, these crypto-linked commodity tokens are approaching a $4 billion overall valuation, reflecting growing investor curiosity. CompaniesMarketCap data showed silver’s market value closing the gap with NVIDIA, a comparison that highlights heavy institutional demand for metal exposure. Still, tokenized assets remain small compared with spot markets and big ETFs, which means the shift is visible but not yet broad-based. Bitcoin traded near $87,000 with little movement over the same period, according to CoinMarketCap snapshots, and some market charts show Bitcoin losing relative ground to silver since 2017. A silver-to-Bitcoin valuation model places Bitcoin’s trend value near $394,000, a figure that prompts debate among traders about where each market could go next. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s strong inflows in 2025 point to steady institutional accumulation in crypto, while other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s gains can stall without fresh catalysts. Spot silver’s strong weekly gain has left technicians and strategists split. Some say the move reflects a true supply-demand mismatch reinforced by the US critical mineral designation, which has encouraged long-term buying. Others point to the thin volume after the holidays as a factor that magnified price moves. A closing price reversal top pattern at record highs has been flagged by chart watchers, signaling that a correction could follow after such rapid ascent. These signs, combined with extreme RSI readings, raise questions about the sustainability of the current breakout. Market veterans emphasize that fast rallies can reverse quickly when liquidity dries up. Peter Schiff argued that declines often accelerate under pressure, and that idea matters because crowded positions can be unwound in a short span. At the same time, long-term flows into Bitcoin-related ETFs and institutional products should not be ignored; they can support higher prices over time. What traders watch next will be trade volumes, whether silver holds above current levels, and whether Bitcoin regains momentum in the face of metal strength.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trading lower as we begin the final trading week of 2025, albeit a holiday-shortened one once again. The major indices all finished the session modestly lower on Friday, with the venerable S&P 500 taking early bows as it hit a fresh all-time high, joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, which recently entered all-time high territory. With just two full trading days left in the year, you can expect some volatility this week as investors and traders make final portfolio adjustments to close out the year. With sellers sneaking in late Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial closed at 48,710, down 0.04%, while the aforementioned S&P 500 backed off its intra-day all-time high print to close at 6.929 down 0.03%. The Nasdaq finished the day at 21,593, down 0.09%. Yields were flat to moderately lower on Friday as portfolio shuffling and some light profit-taking seemed to be the order for the day. The strong GDP data have challenged expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts next year, supporting a more hawkish stance among some Fed officials. Market pricing currently implies up to two rate cuts in 2026, while the median policymaker projection points to only one. Goldman Sachs said in the fall that it expects two more 25-basis-point reductions in 2026. The 30-year long bond closed Friday at 4.82% while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.13%. Both major oil benchmarks closed lower on Friday, with analysts pointing to the usual thin post-holiday trading as concerns about a looming global supply glut outweigh geopolitical supply risks, despite recent disruptions from actions against Venezuela and the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Brent Crude closed the day at $60.87, down 2.2%, while West Texas Intermediate finished Friday’s session at $56.94, down 2.2%. The big winner on Friday was Natural Gas, which had taken a beating over the previous two weeks, as it surged 3.5% higher to close at $4.39. Analysts cited cold weather, high LNG exports, and tighter storage levels, which are expected to drive winter demand upward despite warmer spells. Plus, short covering after a 20%+ move down was a possible reason for the gains. Gold continued to race higher after smashing through the $4500 mark earlier in the week, to finish Friday at $4,494. More positive coverage at Goldman Sachs, which sees the precious metal hitting $4,900 in 2026 and says “Gold remains our single favorite long commodity,” was a factor in Friday’s move higher. Silver also continued on a moonshot parabolic move, closing Friday at $75.98. Both remain at all-time highs, and investors could see additional substantial gains as we head into 2026. The crypto market saw another day of high volatility and generally mixed to lower trading on Friday, with major assets like Bitcoin initially rising modestly before sliding later in the day due to the typical thin holiday liquidity and a surge in precious metals pricing that drew significant investor capital in end-of-year moves. At 8 a.m. EST on Monday, Bitcoin was quoted at $87,580, while Ethereum was seen at $2,962. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

About us Copy link XRP exchange-traded funds are charging head-on into 2026. ETFs backed by the fifth largest crypto have attracted over $1 billion in investment since launching in November, according to SoSoValue data. There has not been a single day of net outflow since their debut. That far outpaces comparable Solana ETFs, which have pulled in $387 million over the same period. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $3.6 billion in selloffs in the same timeframe. Ethereum ETFs have also bled $1.2 billion, DefiLlama data shows. But the flood of capital into ETFs backed by XRP has not helped the token’s price after the crypto market’s October downturn that wiped out $1 trillion in value. XRP is trading at $1.88 at time of reporting, 49% below its all-time high of $3.65 set in July. “We expect the price pattern to broadly resemble what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum, though on a much smaller scale,” Jonathan Yark, quantitative trader at Acheron Trading, told DL News. “XRP has specific use cases around payments and treasury flows,” Yark said. “We’re in a genuine adoption phase for crypto ETFs, which means periods of rapid inflows followed by consolidation.” The relentless capital inflow into XRP ETFs comes as more and more institutions embrace crypto. Vanguard, the $11 trillion asset management heavyweight long associated with institutional restraint, reversed course and launched spot crypto ETF trading earlier in December. “Vanguard’s distribution reach is enormous, and opening access signals a shift from opposition to adoption. That alone will help pull more traditional investors into the asset class,” Yark said. Wall Street stalwarts including BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, all have rolled out crypto ETF offerings over the past two years. “Institutions, like Bank of America and Vanguard, are steadily opening access and that shift supports a sustained, long-term market rather than a short-lived boom,” Yark said. Other firms expected to launch their own XRP ETFs include 21Shares, ProShares, and CoinShares, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s website shows. “Flows will remain highly dependent on settlement, but the broader trajectory is clearly positive.” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Ethereum’s record staking queue looks bullish, but one corporate giant is secretly distorting the real signal

Ethereum’s staking congestion signals institutional interest amidst regulatory progress, led by BitMine’s bold move. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A single corporate treasury has effectively hijacked Ethereum’s validator mechanics, executing a billion-dollar maneuver that has flipped the network’s flow data from a steady exodus to a sudden traffic jam. For the first time in six months, the queue to stake ETH, locking up tokens to secure the blockchain in exchange for yield, significantly outstrips the line to exit. Data compiled by the Ethereum Validator Queue tracker shows approximately 734,299 ETH waiting for entry, implying a mandatory delay of nearly two weeks before these coins can begin earning rewards. By comparison, the exit queue holds roughly 343,179 ETH, with a delay of six days. On the surface, the data suggests a broad resurgence in investor sentiment, a bullish signal for a proof-of-stake network where participation is often read as a proxy for long-term confidence. However, a closer examination of the on-chain flows reveals a more concentrated reality. Nearly half of the entire entry backlog, 342,560 ETH, originates from a single entity: BitMine, the largest public ETH holding firm. The digital asset treasury firm’s aggressive entry over the past 48 hours has distorted the signal, masking what remains a cautious market environment. While the validator line is indeed moving up, the “crowd” is arguably a single whale creating a wake that retail and smaller institutional players are merely drafting behind. For traders and analysts, distinguishing between broad organic demand and idiosyncratic corporate treasury management has become the primary challenge of the holiday trading session. While BitMine dominates the immediate flows, its move is not occurring in a vacuum. It coincides with a pivotal shift in the regulatory environment that has fundamentally reduced the risk of staking for US institutions. In a landmark clarification earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that liquid staking activities, specifically the receipt of tokens representing staked assets, do not constitute securities transactions, provided the provider exerts no managerial effort. This was followed in November by the IRS and Treasury Department issuing Revenue Procedure 2025-31. This guidance created a “safe harbor” for exchange-traded products (ETPs) and trusts, allowing them to stake digital assets without jeopardizing their tax status as grantor trusts. Asset manager Grayscale stated that these two policy changes have effectively greenlit a new era of product structure. In a recent note to clients, the firm's analysts argued that crypto ETPs' ability to stake will likely make them the default structure for holding investment positions in proof-of-stake tokens. Due to this, the firm predicts a bifurcated market in which custodial staking via ETPs captures the passive bid, exerting pressure on reward rates. In contrast, on-chain liquid staking retains the advantages of composability within DeFi. This regulatory clarity explains why capital is moving now. The “institutional pipeline” is no longer blocked by compliance ambiguity. As a result, the market has seen BlackRock advance its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ticker: ETHB), and Grayscale has already enabled staking for its Ethereum Trust (ETHE). These regulated vehicles are now routing portions of their massive established holdings into the validator set, transforming static assets into productive ones. Meanwhile, this shift has forced a maturity upgrade across the crypto infrastructure stack. Staking represents a new form of yield on otherwise idle digital assets, but for institutions, the implications go far beyond simple returns. The primary driver is capital efficiency: the ability to convert static holdings into productive assets while maintaining on-chain exposure. However, this efficiency introduces new layers of operational complexity. Validator management, slashing risk, and reporting obligations demand a professional infrastructure that retail wallets cannot support. Furthermore, strict regulatory classification and audit requirements mean that staking must now align with fiduciary duties and jurisdictional standards. So, institutions that treat staking as a robust operational process, factoring in segregation, reporting, and compliance, are positioned to capture sustainable yield and strategic advantage. However, those that fail to professionalize risk falling behind in an increasingly competitive, yield-aware digital asset market. Nezhda Aliyeva, Head of Product at Platform, said, “Institutional staking is moving from experiment to expectation. Our clients want yield, but they want it delivered with the same rigour as any other financial operation – segregated, secure, and compliant.” Meanwhile, the current congestion is not solely due to new money; it is also a story of returning capital. The validator set is currently refilling after a period of intense technical and market-driven churn. First, the “Pectra” network upgrade was implemented. Among other changes, Pectra raised the maximum effective balance for validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This improvement in staking user experience allowed large operators to consolidate thousands of small validators into fewer, larger ones. Ethereum's Pectra upgrade raises validator stake limits, yet security and standardization concerns surface. The upgrade made restaking easier for large balances, prompting a wave of operational shuffling that is only now stabilizing. Second, a security scare involving staking provider Kiln caused a mass exodus. Following an API exploit prevention protocol, Kiln initiated a precautionary unstaking of Ethereum validators to safeguard client funds. Kiln takes responsible steps to safeguard funds amid SwissBorg-related exploit, impacting Ethereum staking times. While no funds were lost on Ethereum, the move forced a significant percentage of the network’s stake to exit and wait out the safety period. Those coins are now rotating back in, contributing to the entry jam. Simultaneously, the DeFi sector underwent a painful deleveraging. According to DeFi analyst Ignas, a spike in borrow rates on Aave forced traders utilizing “looping” strategies, leveraging staked Ethereum (stETH) to borrow more ETH, to unwind their positions. This trend, which Ignas notes was kick-started by maneuvering from heavyweights like Justin Sun, flushed leverage out of the system. The result is visible in the broader data. Dune Analytics figures indicate that the total amount of ETH deposited by investors into protocols and contracts has remained relatively stable at around 36 million. The queue drama, therefore, is less about a massive injection of fresh cash and more about the network's “plumbing” resetting itself. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Real-world assets top DEXs to become 5th-largest category in DeFi by TVL

RWA protocols have overtaken decentralized exchanges by total value locked, as tokenized Treasurys, private credit and commodities become core onchain building blocks. Cointelegraph in your social feed Real-world asset (RWA) protocols are one of decentralized finance’s (DeFi’s) winners in 2025, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to become the fifth-largest category by total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. RWAs now account for about $17 billion in TVL, up from $12 billion in Q4 2024, highlighting how quickly tokenized Treasurys, private credit and other real-world claims have moved from niche experiments to core DeFi plumbing. As DefiLlama noted, “At the start of this year, they weren’t even in the top 10 categories.” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that RWA growth is being driven by “balance-sheet incentives rather than experimentation,” with higher-for-longer rates making tokenized Treasurys and private credit attractive as onchain, yield-bearing assets, amid improving regulatory clarity that is lowering friction for institutional allocators. Earlier this year, RWAs excluding stablecoins had grown to about $24 billion, with private credit and tokenized Treasurys identified as the main growth engines and Ethereum as the dominant public settlement layer for onchain debt and fund structures. Related: Emerging market economies to drive RWA tokenization in 2026: Crypto exec Through 2025, that market has remained concentrated around a small group of large issuers and vehicles on Ethereum, while RWA.xyz data shows a second tier of networks, including BNB Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon and Arbitrum, each capturing low‑to-mid single‑digit percentage shares of public‑chain RWA value. In parallel, permissioned infrastructure like Canton Network has become a major institutional hub, with over 90% of the total market share, hosting large RWA programs in a privacy‑preserving, regulated environment that can plug into DeFi data and liquidity rails. Related: Canton token rallies 27% after DTCC outlines tokenized Treasury plans Tokenized US Treasurys remain the gateway product, with platforms like the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Circle’s USYC, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, Ondo’s OUSG, and similar funds pushing the combined tokenized Treasury segment above the multi‑billion‑dollar mark by December. Liu said that “the constraint is no longer tokenization itself, but liquidity, and integration into TradFi,” adding that attention in 2026, “attention should shift from headline TVL to control and usage, who owns issuance, where RWAs are deployed as collateral, and which venues capture secondary market flow.” Rallies in gold and silver are adding a fresh leg to the RWA trade, pulling more capital into tokenized commodities. Recent data put tokenized commodities’ market cap near $4 billion, led by gold products such as Tether Gold and Paxos Gold, which have expanded alongside spot metals, pushing toward new highs. Liu said these moves are “elevating [tokenized commodities] from niche RWAs to macro-relevant assets with real demand for on-chain access and settlement in a 24/7 market,” helped by clearer pricing and custody standards that make them easier to plug into DeFi and institutional systems. Into 2026, he pointed to “behavioral validation” as gold and silver break highs, arguing that price strength attracts issuance, which attracts liquidity and reinforces adoption beyond pure yield narratives. He also highlighted interoperability as another key signal, and said that “real acceleration” will come when “tokenized commodities can move seamlessly across venues and chains, functioning as neutral collateral rather than isolated products.” FOLLOW US © Cointelegraph 2013 - 2025 COINTELEGRAPH NEWSLETTER MOBILE APPS Cointelegraph covers fintech, blockchain and Bitcoin bringing you the latest crypto news and analyses on the future of money.

ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY Krist Boo Summary AI generated Published Dec 29, 2025, 04:00 PM Updated Dec 29, 2025, 06:27 PM SINGAPORE – Investors could see more familiar Chinese names on the local bourse in 2026 as the Singapore Exchange (SGX) makes a renewed push to draw Chinese companies for listings. Fresh from grant injections by the Government and recent regulatory nods from both sides, the exchange is gunning for tried-and-proven businesses like advanced manufacturing, as well as those in digital infrastructure, consumer technology, healthcare and sustainable energy. This time, compared with the 2000s, targets will be on businesses deemed to have long wicks rather than stars that light up the scene, just to fizzle out shortly after. The first pitch is to familiar brands here to put their primary, or first, listings here, said Ms Chia Caihan, SGX Group’s head of capital markets for Greater China. Speaking to The Straits Times at SGX Centre on Dec 17, she said at the top of this list are Chinese businesses that have moved their headquarters here and are eyeing growth in this region. With fund raising slowing in China, SGX’s second pitch is to companies already listed in China to come for a secondary listing. It will help raise their brand profile among investors here if they are eyeing expansion in South-east Asia, she said. A secondary listing also allows them to issue their Singapore employees shares, which cannot be done with their Chinese counters, known as A-shares – owing to foreign ownership restrictions and currency controls. Singapore offers these companies access to US and European investors, as well as regional investors who increasingly recognise Chinese brands and are willing to invest in them, Ms Chia said. “China’s governance disclosures are now almost at developed market standards. You look at the kind of disclosures that they require, it is almost compatible with developed jurisdictions.” The criteria for prospects are a clear strategic mindset for listing, with local presence and shareholder communication, she said. In the 2000s, a number of Chinese-listed companies – known as S-chips on SGX – were facing accusations over fraud, accounting irregularities and debt issues, and delistings and share suspensions followed. Ms Chia, who started in SGX in 2004 and took on her current portfolio in 2024, said that this time, it will be different. The companies that listed on the exchange then were narrow in their scope of businesses, she said. Some of those companies did well when they were approved for listing, but did not have the scope to pivot when the economic cycle changed. “Some of them took the extreme route of doing illegal stuff, falsifying accounts and all that. That sent a very bad message to the market, and it affected the confidence. We don’t want that to happen again,” she said. SGX’s push is bolstered by the $5 billion Equity Market Development Programme, launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in 2025. $5 billion Equity Market Development Programme The kitty channels funds via managers including BlackRock and Eastspring to provide cornerstone capital, or funds committed for a chunk of shares in new listings that helps shore up their credibility; market-making support; and research grants as part of its goal to revive tepid investor and listing activity on SGX in recent years. Regulatory support also came in December following a meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, who is also Minister for Trade and Industry, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang, which resulted in bilateral support for Chinese companies to mount secondary listings on SGX. The exchange listed 614 companies on its mainboard and Catalist as at Dec 18, including about 100 of Chinese origin. Recent listings include shoe rubber adhesive maker Infinity Development on the Catalist and Yangzijiang Maritime Development, a spin-off of Yangzijiang Financial, which was itself carved out from Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, which listed in 2007. The first time Yangzijiang Shipbuilding spun off its financial arm, the original company more than doubled its value from $6 billion, said Ms Chia, illustrating the potential of the market. Against its competitor, the Hong Kong stock exchange, SGX touts Singapore’s edge in its Government’s support – even post-listing – with research and growth funding, Ms Chia said. Low liquidity, a frequent complaint about SGX, does not worry Chinese investors, with early help from the exchange on netting secondary investors after their listing, and market-making research. Companies valued under $5 billion would find the support especially helpful. “I think they are pretty comfortable with what we can offer because they don’t get this kind of support when they go to other markets. They are just too small,” she said. The Republic also has a diverse investor base: Asean players, family offices, European pension and hedge funds, Middle Eastern funds, as well as regional vehicles of US-based funds, which are mostly avoiding Chinese investments given geopolitical tensions. Asked about “Singapore-washing” concerns, where listings might superficially rebrand China-centric operations, Ms Chia said: “A listing does not make you a Singapore company overnight. “You need to work together with our SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). You need to see how to make use of our talent and resources.” Compared with the Chinese entrepreneurs who arrived two decades ago, and who sometimes imported entire supply chains without integration, today’s cohort is more aware of the need to reciprocate. “They recognise the benefits that Singapore is giving them, and a lot of them are giving it back to Singapore. It is just that, given their status – they may still be Chinese citizens – they cannot do it that openly. “But I would say that they have been doing more than what we expect because they really hope to blend into Singapore.” For local investors, participating in these companies’ corporate meetings and asking questions will keep the companies on their toes and help them communicate more. On why getting the listings matters, Ms Chia said: “Chinese companies are important because in the overall corporate world, they have become a very important piece.” The move also helps Singapore retain and grow its wealth, she said. “That is why I would think that everybody has a role to play in it.” Krist Boo is senior business correspondent at The Straits Times.

This year-in-review episode features an exceptional panel of Python luminaries representing diverse perspectives across education, industry, and core Python development: Gregory Kapfhammer is an Associate Professor of Computer and Information Science who conducts research in software engineering and software testing. He has built numerous Python tools, with current research focusing on flaky test cases in Python projects. Gregory also hosts the Software Engineering Radio podcast sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, where he has interviewed many members of the Python community. Thomas Wouters is a longtime Python core developer who worked at Google for 17 years before joining Meta. He has served multiple terms on the PSF Board and the Python Steering Council. In 2025, Thomas received the PSF Distinguished Service Award recognizing his extensive contributions to Python. Jodie Burchell is a Data Scientist and Developer Advocate at JetBrains, working on PyCharm. She has been a data scientist for around 10 years after transitioning from a career as a clinical psychologist. Jodie has been working with NLP and LLMs since before they became mainstream, including early Google language models from 2019. Brett Cannon has been at Microsoft for 10 years and is currently working on AI R&D for Python developers. He also maintains WASI support for Python and does internal consulting. Despite being a core developer for 22 years, Brett jokes that he is the "shortest-running" core developer on this panel. He previously managed the Python experience in VS Code. Reuven Lerner is a freelance Python and Pandas trainer who celebrated 30 years of freelancing in 2024. He teaches Python and Pandas both at companies and through his online platform, writes newsletters, publishes books, and speaks at conferences. Barry Warsaw has been a Python core developer since 1994, making him the longest-tenured developer on the panel. He worked with Guido van Rossum at CNRI in Python's early days, handling mailing lists, version control, and websites. Barry created the PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) process 25 years ago. He is currently at NVIDIA doing Python work split between internal projects and external open-source community contributions, and serves on the Steering Council. If you are newer to Python and want to get the most out of this episode analysis, here are some foundational concepts that will help: The most transformative development in Python for 2025 is the advancement of free-threaded Python, which removes the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Thomas Wouters, who championed this effort, confirmed that free threading has moved from experimental to officially supported status in Python 3.14. The performance overhead is remarkably small - basically the same speed on macOS (due to ARM hardware and Clang optimizations) and only a few percent slower on Linux with recent GCC versions. The main challenge now is community adoption: getting third-party packages to update their extension modules for the new APIs. Barry Warsaw called this "one of the most transformative developments for Python, certainly since Python 3." Early experiments show promising results, with highly parallel workloads seeing 10x or greater speedups. The PyTorch data loader, for example, has seen massive improvements by leveraging multiple threads. Jodie Burchell provided a grounded perspective on AI in 2025, noting that GPT-5's release in August marked a turning point where mainstream observers began questioning the AI bubble. The "scaling laws" that promised exponential improvements turned out not to be laws at all, and OpenAI's internal struggles to deliver on AGI promises became public. Investment in AI spending now exceeds consumer spending in the US, which Jodie called "a really scary prospect." Despite the bubble concerns, the panel universally agreed that LLMs are incredibly useful tools that are here to stay. Gregory Kapfhammer shared that automated refactoring, test generation, and code coverage improvement - goals he thought would never be achieved in his lifetime - are now routine with tools like Claude Code. The consensus: even if models never improve beyond current capabilities, they represent a massive leap beyond previous development tools. Barry Warsaw noted he no longer searches for documentation - he just asks the AI to set things up. Brett Cannon highlighted a fundamental shift in how Python developers work: tools like uv, Hatch, and PDM now treat Python itself as an implementation detail. Instead of the traditional workflow of installing Python, creating a virtual environment, and managing dependencies, developers can now simply run a command like uv run and everything is handled automatically. This represents a "renewed focus on user experience" according to Barry Warsaw. The distance between having an idea and having working code has dramatically narrowed. Combined with PEP 723 (inline script metadata), you can now put uv in the shebang line of a Python script and share it without any setup instructions - the script carries its own dependency information. Gregory Kapfhammer shared that he now starts undergraduate students with uv on the first day of class, eliminating the week-long setup struggles that used to plague even strong students. Gregory Kapfhammer declared 2025 "the year of type checking and language server protocols," highlighting the emergence of three new Rust-based type checkers: Pyrefly from Meta, ty from Astral, and Zubon from David Halter (creator of Jedi). These tools have transformed what previously took tens or hundreds of seconds into sub-second operations. The speed improvements fundamentally change how developers interact with type checking - it becomes a real-time feedback loop rather than a batch process. However, Gregory noted a challenge: different type checkers can disagree on whether code has errors, even on the same codebase. His research team built a tool that automatically generates Python programs causing type checkers to disagree with each other. The PyLands team at Microsoft is working with the Pyrefly team to define a Type Server Protocol (TSP) that would let type checkers feed information to higher-level LSPs. Reuven Lerner raised concerns about Python's funding sustainability. The PSF had to pause its grants program and turned down an NSF government grant due to attached DEI restrictions that conflicted with PSF values. Most Python users have no idea the language needs funding - they just know they can download it for free. Thomas Wouters pointed out that major AI companies, despite relying entirely on PyPI and Python infrastructure, have done "basically no sponsorship of the PSF." The amounts needed are surprisingly small - less than what a medium company spends on expensed meal tips annually, or less than a Silicon Valley developer's salary. All panelists' employers (Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA, JetBrains) are PSF sponsors, but many companies using Python are not. Reuven noted that NumFocus has about twice the PSF's budget, suggesting it is possible to get corporate sponsorship for Python-related projects. Thomas Wouters mentioned lazy imports as his "second favorite child" topic - a PEP that was accepted in 2025 and will significantly improve Python startup time and import performance. This feature defers the actual importing of modules until they are first used, rather than loading everything at startup. The lazy imports PEP (810) had broad community support despite some very vocal opposition. Pablo Galindo, a Steering Council member, led the effort and bore the brunt of criticism despite the technical merits being clear. This feature will be especially impactful for applications with many imports that may not all be needed for every code path. Barry Warsaw, who created the PEP process 25 years ago, acknowledged that authoring PEPs has become "incredibly difficult and emotionally draining." The community has grown exponentially, but discussions on discuss.python.org can become toxic. PEP authors regularly receive vitriol in their personal inboxes for proposing technical changes. The Steering Council itself exists because Guido van Rossum received such abuse over PEP 572 (the walrus operator) that he stepped down as BDFL. Thomas shared that Pablo Galindo received "ridiculous accusations" in his mailbox simply for proposing lazy imports. Core developers sometimes skip the PEP process entirely to avoid this gauntlet, which is also problematic because important changes don't get properly documented or discussed. Barry believes Python needs to rethink how it evolves the language while not losing the voice of users. With free threading joining asyncio, multiprocessing, and subinterpreters, Python now has multiple concurrency approaches. Reuven asked how developers should choose between them. Thomas explained that most end users should not need to make these low-level choices - higher-level abstractions should handle it. Brett suggested using concurrent.futures as a unified interface where you start with threads (fastest), fall back to subinterpreters if needed, then to process pools. Michael Kennedy expressed hope that Python's concurrency could eventually solidify around async/await with decorators indicating the execution mode, hiding the complexity from developers. The key insight is that different problems benefit from different approaches, and libraries like PyTorch are already combining techniques (using threads for data loading within an async framework) to achieve massive speedups. Gregory Kapfhammer gave a shout-out to regional Python conferences, specifically highlighting PyOhio as a free conference that anyone can attend with no registration fee, hosted at universities like Ohio State and Cleveland State. These local events provide accessible entry points to the Python community. Reuven shared a contrasting experience attending a non-Python conference where all speakers were from advertisers and sponsors, and people were not interested in sharing. He called Python conferences "really special" for the combination of career benefits and genuine community connection. The community aspect remains one of Python's greatest strengths. A Stanford study (the "10K Developer Study") examining real codebases found nuanced results about AI coding assistants. Yes, there are productivity boosts, but AI produces more code that tends to be worse than human-written code and introduces more bugs. When accounting for refactoring and debugging time, developers are still more productive overall. AI works better for greenfield projects, smaller codebases, simpler problems, and more popular languages (more training data). Jodie emphasized that like an IDE, AI is a tool - not a replacement. Barry's favorite use is bypassing documentation: instead of searching docs, he asks the AI to set things up. Gregory noted that AI agents work much better when given fast feedback tools like type checkers and linters. Thomas emphasized the importance of new people joining Python - as triagers, drive-by commenters, or eventually core developers. Python is what the community makes it, with no company dictating direction. Barry encouraged anyone interested in becoming a core developer to find a mentor, and anyone wanting to be involved with the PSF to reach out. Thomas pointed out he is a high school dropout who never went to college, while Brett has a PhD - neither credential is required to contribute meaningfully to Python. The call to action: run for the Steering Council (they need more candidates), sponsor the PSF if your company uses Python, and engage with the community in whatever way fits your skills and interests. "Python in 2025 is a delightfully refreshing place. The GIL's days are numbered, packaging is getting sharper tools, and the type checkers are multiplying like gremlins snacking after midnight." -- Michael Kennedy "I can remember thinking to myself how cool would it be if I had a system that could automatically refactor and then add test cases and increase the code coverage and make sure all my checkers and linters pass... I remember thinking five to seven years ago I would never realize that goal in my entire lifetime. And now when I use Anthropic's models through Claude Code, it's incredible how much you can achieve so quickly." -- Gregory Kapfhammer "I'm glad I'll never have to write bash from scratch ever again." -- Brett Cannon on AI assistance "I never even search for the docs. I never even try to read the docs anymore. I just say, hey, I need to set up this website. And I just tell me what to do or just do it. And it's an immense time saver." -- Barry Warsaw "The GIL never gave you thread safety. The GIL gave CPython's internals thread safety. It never really affected Python code." -- Thomas Wouters "Free threading is absolutely the future of Python, and I think it's going to unlock incredible potential and performance." -- Barry Warsaw "It's ridiculous how small those sponsorships are and yet how grateful we were that they came in because every single one has such a big impact." -- Thomas Wouters on PSF funding "What the PSF would be happy with is less than a medium company spends on the tips of expensed meals every year." -- Thomas Wouters, quoting Ned Batchelder "I don't want to call on people in the community to do it because they're probably the same people who are also donating their time for Python. It's just squeezing people who give so much of themselves to this community even more." -- Jodie Burchell on funding burnout "Python is the community or the community is Python. There's no company that is telling anybody what Python should be. Python is what we make it." -- Barry Warsaw "I'm a high school dropout and I never went to college or anything. And look at me." -- Thomas Wouters on qualifications needed for Python contribution GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): A mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. Its removal in free-threaded Python enables true parallel execution of Python code across multiple CPU cores. Free-Threaded Python: A build of Python without the GIL, allowing multiple threads to execute Python bytecode simultaneously. Officially supported in Python 3.14. PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal): The formal process for proposing major changes to Python. Created by Barry Warsaw 25 years ago, PEPs document design decisions and the rationale behind language features. LSP (Language Server Protocol): A protocol for communication between code editors and language-specific tools that provide features like autocomplete, go-to-definition, and error checking. Type Checker: A tool that analyzes Python code with type hints to catch type-related errors before runtime. Examples include mypy, Pyrefly, ty, and Pyright. Lazy Imports: A feature (PEP 810) where module imports are deferred until the imported names are actually used, improving startup time for applications with many imports. PyPI (Python Package Index): The official repository for Python packages, run by the PSF and used by millions of developers daily. Steering Council: A five-person elected body that provides leadership for Python's development, created after Guido van Rossum stepped down as BDFL in 2018. PEP 723: Inline script metadata that allows Python scripts to declare their dependencies and Python version requirements directly in the file, enabling tools like uv to automatically set up the correct environment. Subinterpreters: Isolated Python interpreters running in separate threads within the same process, providing parallelism with stronger isolation than threads but less overhead than multiprocessing. For those looking to deepen their understanding of topics covered in this episode, here are relevant courses from Talk Python Training: Rock Solid Python with Python Typing: Learn the ins-and-outs of Python typing, explore frameworks using types like Pydantic and FastAPI, and get guidance for using types effectively in your applications. Async Techniques and Examples in Python: Master the entire spectrum of Python's parallel APIs including async/await, asyncio, threads, multiprocessing, and coordination techniques. LLM Building Blocks for Python: Learn to integrate large language models into Python applications with structured outputs, chat workflows, and production-ready async pipelines. Getting Started with pytest: Master pytest's five superpowers - simple test functions, fixtures, parametrization, markers, and plugins. Python for Absolute Beginners: Start from the very beginning with CS 101 concepts before building increasingly complex Python applications. Modern Python Projects: Learn project structure, dependency management, testing, documentation, CI/CD, and deployment for real-world Python applications. Python in 2025 stands at an inflection point where decades of foundational work are paying off in transformative ways. The removal of the GIL promises to unlock true parallelism, modern tooling like uv is abstracting away complexity that once frustrated beginners, and Rust-based type checkers are making static analysis feel instantaneous. Yet beneath these technical victories lies a community wrestling with sustainability - funding challenges, contributor burnout, and the difficulty of evolving a language used by millions through a 25-year-old proposal process. What shines through this conversation is that Python's greatest asset has always been its people. From Barry Warsaw, who has been contributing since 1994 and created the very PEP process he now seeks to reform, to Jodie Burchell, a relative newcomer who marveled at how welcoming the community has been, the panel represents a continuum of experience united by shared values. The call to action is clear: sponsor the PSF if your company uses Python, contribute in whatever way fits your skills, attend regional conferences, and remember that Python is not a product controlled by any corporation - it is what we collectively make it. The future is being built right now by people who simply showed up and got involved. 00:00 Python in 2025 is a delightfully refreshing place. 00:04 The guild's days are numbered, packaging is getting sharper tools, 00:07 and the type checkers are multiplying like gremlins snacking after midnight. 00:11 On this episode, we have an amazing panel to give us a range of perspectives 00:15 on what mattered in 2025 in Python. 00:19 We have Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Gregory Kampfhammer, Jody Burchell, Reuven Lerner, 00:24 and Thomas Worders on the show to give us their thoughts. 00:28 This is Talk Python To Me, episode 532, recorded December 9th, 2025. 00:50 Welcome to Talk Python To Me, the number one Python podcast for developers and data scientists. 00:55 This is your host, Michael Kennedy. 00:57 I'm a PSF fellow who's been coding for over 25 years. 01:01 Let's connect on social media. 01:03 You'll find me and Talk Python on Mastodon, BlueSky, and X. 01:06 The social links are all in your show notes. 01:09 You can find over 10 years of past episodes at talkpython.fm. 01:12 And if you want to be part of the show, you can join our recording live streams. 01:16 That's right. 01:17 We live stream the raw uncut version of each episode on YouTube. 01:20 Just visit talkpython.fm/youtube to see the schedule of upcoming events. 01:25 Be sure to subscribe there and press the bell so you'll get notified anytime we're recording. 01:29 Look into the future and see bugs before they make it to production. 01:33 Sentry's SEER AI code review uses historical error and performance information at Sentry 01:39 to find and flag bugs in your PRs before you even start to review them. 01:43 Stop bugs before they enter your code base. 01:46 Get started at talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 01:50 Hey, before we jump into the interview, I just want to send a little message to all the companies out there with products and services trying to reach developers. 01:59 That is the listeners of this show. 02:01 As we're rolling into 2026, I have a bunch of spots open. 02:05 So please reach out to me if you're looking to sponsor a podcast or just generally sponsor things in the community. 02:12 And you haven't necessarily considered podcasts. 02:14 You really should reach out to me and I'll help you connect with the Talk Python audience. 02:20 thanks everyone for listening all of 2025 and here we go into 2026 cheers hey everyone it's so 02:27 awesome to be here with you all thanks for taking the time out of your day to be part of talk python 02:31 for this year in review this python year in review so yeah let's just jump right into it gregory 02:38 welcome welcome to the show welcome back to the show how you doing hi i'm an associate professor 02:42 of computer and information science and i do research and software engineering and software 02:46 testing. I've built a bunch of Python tools, and one of the areas we're studying now is flaky test 02:51 cases in Python projects. I'm also really excited about teaching in a wide variety of areas. In fact, 02:57 I use Python for operating systems classes or theory of computation classes. And one of the 03:02 things I'm excited about is being a podcast host. I'm also a host on the Software Engineering Radio 03:08 podcast sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, and I've had the cool opportunity to interview a 03:14 whole bunch of people in the Python community. So Michael, thanks for welcoming me to the show. 03:18 Yeah, it's awesome to have you back. And we talked about FlakyTest last time. I do have to say 03:23 your AV setup is quite good. I love the new mic and all that. Thomas, welcome. Awesome to have 03:29 you here. Thanks for having me. I'm Thomas Wauters. I'm a longtime Python core developer, 03:34 although not as long as one of the other guests on this podcast. I worked at Google for 17 years. 03:40 for the last year or so I've worked at Meta. In both cases, I work on Python itself within the 03:45 company and just deploying it internally. I've also been a board member of the PSF, although I'm not 03:51 one right now. And I've been a steering council member for five years and currently not because 03:58 the elections are going and I don't know what the result is going to be. But I think there's like 04:02 five, six chance that I'll be on the steering council since we only have six candidates for 04:09 five positions when this episode probably airs. I don't know. That's quite the contribution to the 04:14 whole community. Thank you. I always forget this. I also got the, what is it, the Distinguished 04:19 Service Award from the PSF this year. I should probably mention that. So yes, I have been 04:24 recognized. No need to talk about it further. Wonderful. Wonderful. Jody, welcome back on the 04:29 show. Awesome to catch up with you. Yeah, thanks for having me back. I am a data scientist and 04:34 developer advocate at JetBrains working on PyCharm. And I've been a data scientist for around 10 04:39 years. And prior to that, I was actually a clinical psychologist. So that was my training, 04:45 my PhD, but abandoned academia for greener pastures. Let's put it that way. 04:50 Noah Franz-Gurig. 04:53 Brett, hello. Good to see you. 04:55 Hello. Yes. Yeah, let's see here. I've been at Microsoft for 10 years. I started doing, 05:00 working on AI R&D for Python developers. 05:03 Also keep Wazzy running for Python here and do a lot of internal consulting for teams outside. 05:09 I am actually the shortest running core developer on this call, amazingly, 05:14 even though I've been doing it for 22 years. 05:16 I've also only gotten the Frank Wilson award, not the DSA. 05:19 So I feel very under accomplished here as a core developer. 05:22 Yeah, that's me in a nutshell. 05:24 Otherwise, I'm still trying to catch that. 05:26 Most quoted. 05:27 Yeah, most quoted. 05:29 I will say actually at work, it is in my email footer that I'm a famous Python quotationist. 05:33 That was Anthony Shaw's suggestion, by the way. 05:35 That was not mine, but does link to the April Fool's joke from last year. 05:39 And I am still trying to catch Anthony Shaw, I think, on appearances on this podcast. 05:43 Well, plus one. 05:44 Anthony Shaw should be here, honestly. 05:46 I mean, I put it out into Discord. 05:48 He could have been here, but probably at an odd time. 05:51 You used to work on VS Code a bunch on the Python aspect of VS Code. 05:54 You recently changed roles, right? 05:57 Not recently. 05:57 That was, I used to be the dev manager. 05:59 Every seven years, years ago. 06:01 Yeah, September of 2024. 06:03 So it's been over a year. 06:04 But yeah, I used to be the dev manager. 06:04 That counts as recent for me. 06:06 Yes, I used to be the dev manager for the Python experience in VS Code. 06:09 Okay, very cool. 06:10 That's quite a shift. 06:11 Yeah, it went back to being an IC basically. 06:13 You got all, you're good at your TPS reports again now? 06:17 Actually, I just did do my connect, so I kind of did. 06:19 Awesome. 06:20 Reuven, I bet you haven't filed a TPS report in at least a year. 06:23 So yeah, I'm Reuven. 06:24 I'm a freelance Python and Pandas trainer. 06:28 I just celebrated this past week 30 years since going freelance. 06:32 So I guess it's working out okay. 06:35 We'll know at some point if I need to get a real job. 06:38 I teach Python Pandas both at companies and on my online platform. 06:41 I have newsletters. 06:42 I've written books, speaking conferences, and generally try to help people improve their 06:47 Python and Pandas fluency and confidence and have a lot of fun with this community as well 06:51 as with the language. 06:52 Oh, good to have you here. 06:53 Barry, it's great to have a musician on the show. 06:56 Thanks. 06:58 Yeah, I've got my bases over here. 07:00 So, you know, if you need to be serenaded. 07:02 Yeah, like a Zen of Python may break out at any moment. 07:05 You never know when it's going to happen. 07:07 Thanks for having me here. 07:08 Yeah, I've been a core developer for a long time, since 1994. 07:13 And I've been, you know, in the early days, I did tons of stuff for Python.org. 07:20 I worked with Guido at CNRI and we moved everything from the mailing, the Postmaster stuff, 07:27 and the version control systems back in the day, websites, all that kind of stuff. 07:32 I try to not do any of those things anymore. 07:35 There's way more competent people doing that stuff now. 07:39 I have been a release manager. 07:42 I'm currently back on the steering council and running again. 07:47 between Thomas and I, we'll see who makes it to six years, I guess. 07:52 And I'm currently working for NVIDIA, and I do all Python stuff. 07:58 Some half and half, roughly, of internal things and external open source community work, 08:05 both in packaging and in core Python. 08:08 That's, I guess, I think that's about it. 08:10 Yeah, you all are living in exciting tech spaces, that's for sure. 08:14 That's for sure. 08:15 For sure. 08:16 Yeah. Well, great to have you all back on the show. Let's start with our first topic. So the 08:20 idea is we've each picked at least a thing that we think stood out in 2025 in the Python space 08:27 that we can focus on. And let's go with Jody first. I'm excited to hear what you thought was 08:33 one of the bigger things. I'm going to mention AI. Like, wow, what a big surprise. So to kind of 08:40 give context of where I'm coming from, I've been working in NLP for a long time. I like to say I was 08:45 working on LLMs before they were cool. So sort of playing around with the very first releases from 08:50 Google in like 2019, incorporating that into search. So I've been very interested sort of 08:56 seeing the unfolding of the GPT models as they've grown. And let's say slightly disgusted by the 09:03 discourse around the models as they become more mainstream, more sort of the talk about people's 09:09 jobs being replaced, a lot of the hysteria, a lot of the doomsday stuff. So I've been doing talks 09:15 and other content for around two and a half years now, just trying to cut through the hype a bit, 09:19 being like, you know, they're just language models, they're good for language tasks. Let's think about 09:23 realistically what they're about. And what was very interesting for me this year, I've been 09:29 incorrectly predicting the bubble bursting for about two and a half years. So I was quite vindicated 09:34 when in August, GPT-5 came out, and all of a sudden, everyone else started saying, 09:40 maybe this is a bubble. 09:41 Don't you think that was the first big release that was kind of a letdown compared to what the hype was? 09:47 Yeah, and it was really interesting. 09:48 So I found this really nice Atlantic article, and I didn't save it, unfortunately, 09:52 but essentially it told sort of the whole story of what was going on behind the scenes. 09:58 So GPT-4 came out in March of 2023, and that was the model that came out 10:03 with this Microsoft research paper saying, you know, sparks of AGI, artificial general intelligence, 10:08 blah, blah, blah. And from that point, there was really this big expectation sort of fueled by 10:15 OpenAI that GPT-5 was going to be the AGI model. And it turns out what was happening internally 10:22 is these scaling laws that were sort of considered, you know, this exponential growth thing that would 10:27 sort of push the power of these models perhaps towards human-like performance. They weren't 10:33 laws at all. And of course they started failing. So the model that they had originally pitched as 10:38 GPT-4 just didn't live up to performance. They started this post-training stuff where they were 10:43 going more into like specialized reasoning models. And what we have now are good models that are good 10:48 for specific tasks, but I don't know what happened, but eventually they had to put the GPT-5 label on 10:54 something. And yeah, let's say it didn't live up to expectations. So I think the cracks are starting 11:01 to show because the underlying expectation always was this will be improving to the point where 11:08 anything's possible and you can't put a price on that. But it turns out that if maybe there's a 11:14 limit on what's possible, yeah, you can put a price on it. And a lot of the valuations are on the 11:19 first part. Yes. And it's always been a bit interesting to me because I come from a scientific 11:24 background and you need to know how to measure stuff, right? And I'm like, what are you trying 11:28 to achieve? Like Gregory's nodding, like, please jump in. I'm on my monologue, so please don't 11:34 interrupt me. You really need to understand what you're actually trying to get these models to do. 11:38 What is AGI? No one knows this. And what's going to be possible with this? And it's more science 11:46 fiction than fact. So this for me has been the big news this year, and I'm feeling slightly smug, 11:51 I'm going to be honest, even though my predictions were off by about a year and a half. 11:55 Yeah, maybe it's not an exponential curve. 11:56 It's a titration S curve with an asymptote. 11:59 We'll see. 12:00 Yeah, sigmoid. 12:01 Yeah. 12:02 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 12:03 I mean, I think we have to sort of separate the technology from the business. 12:07 And the technology, even if it doesn't get any better, even if we stay with what we have today, 12:13 I still think this is like one of the most amazing technologies I've ever seen. 12:18 It's not a god. 12:19 It's not a panacea. 12:21 But it's like a chainsaw that if you know how to use it, it's really effective. 12:25 but in the hands of amateurs, you can really get hurt. And so, yes, it's great to see this sort of 12:32 thing happening and improving, but who knows where it's going to go. And I'm a little skeptical of 12:36 the AGI thing. What I'm a little more worried about is that these companies seem to have no 12:40 possible way of ever making the money that they're promising to their investors. And I do worry a lot 12:47 that we're sort of like a year 2000 situation where, yeah, the technology is fantastic, 12:53 But the businesses are unsustainable. And out of the ashes of what will happen, we will get some amazing technology and even better than we had before. But there are going to be ashes. 13:03 For me, that also makes me worry. And I don't know if anyone reads Ed Zitron here. He's a 13:09 journalist kind of digging into the state of the AI industry. He does get a bit sort of, 13:15 his reputation is a bit of a crank now. So I think he's leaned into that pretty hard, 13:20 but he does take the time to also pull out numbers and point out things that don't make sense. 13:25 And he was one of the first ones to sound the whistle on this circular funding we've been seeing. 13:30 So the worry, of course, is when a lot of this becomes borrowings from banks and then that starts dragging in funding from everyday people. 13:41 And also the effect that this has had on particularly the U.S. economy, like the stock market. 13:45 I think the investment in AI spending now exceeds consumer spending in the U.S., which is a really scary prospect. 13:54 That is crazy. 13:55 Mm-hmm. But yeah, also as Reven said, I love LLMs. They are the most powerful tools we've 14:02 ever had for natural language processing. It's phenomenal the problems we can solve with them 14:06 now. I didn't think this sort of stuff would be possible when I started in data science. 14:10 I still think there's a use case for agents, although I do think they've been a bit overstated, 14:16 especially now that I'm building them. Let's say it's not very fun building 14:20 non-deterministic software. It's quite frustrating, actually. But I hope we're going to see improvements 14:25 in the framework, particularly I've heard good things about Pydantic AI. And yeah, hopefully we 14:30 can control the input outputs and make them a bit more strict. This will fix a lot of the problems. 14:36 One thing I do want to put out in this conversation, I think is worth separating. And Reuven, 14:41 you touched on this some. I want to suggest to you, I'll throw this out to you all and see what 14:45 you think. I think it's very possible that this AI bubble crashes the economy and causes bad things 14:51 economically to happen and a bunch of companies that are like wrappers over open ai api go away 14:58 but i don't think things like the agentic coding tools will vanish they might stop training they 15:03 might slow their advance because that's super expensive but i even as if you said even if we 15:09 just had claude sonnet 4 and the world never got something else it would be so much far farther 15:16 beyond autocomplete and the other stuff that we had before and stack overflow that it's i don't 15:20 think it's going to go. The reason I'm throwing this out there is I was talking to somebody and 15:23 they were like, well, I don't think it's worth learning because I think the bubble is going to 15:26 pop. And so I don't want to learn this agent at coding because it won't be around very long. 15:30 What do you all think? It's here to stay. I think it's just, where's the limit? Where does it stop? 15:34 I think that's the big open question for everybody, right? Like pragmatically, it's a tool. It's useful 15:40 in some scenarios and not in others. And you just have to learn how to use the tool appropriately 15:44 for your use case and to get what you need out of it. And sometimes that's not using it because 15:47 it's just going to take up more time than it will to be productive. But other times it's 15:51 fully juices up your productivity and you can get more done. It's give and take. But I don't think 15:56 it's going to go anywhere because as you said, Michael, there's even academics doing research now. 16:00 There's open weight models as well. There's a lot of different ways to run this, whether you're 16:05 at the scale of the frontier models that are doing these huge trainings or you're doing something 16:11 local and more specialized. So I think the general use of AI isn't going anywhere. I think it's just 16:16 the question of how far can this current trend go and where will it be i want to say stop that's 16:22 because that plays into the whole it's never it's going to completely go away i don't think it ever 16:25 will i think it's just going to be where where are we going to start to potentially bump up against 16:29 limits one thing that i'll say is that many of these systems are almost to me like a dream come 16:33 true now admittedly it's the case that the systems i'm building are maybe only tens of thousands of 16:38 lines or hundreds of thousands of lines but i can remember thinking to myself how cool would it be 16:44 if I had a system that could automatically refactor 16:47 and then add test cases and increase the code coverage 16:51 and make sure all my checkers and linters pass and do that automatically and continue the process 16:57 until it achieved its goal. 16:59 And I remember thinking that five to seven years ago, 17:01 I would never realize that goal in my entire lifetime. 17:05 And now when I use like anthropics models through open code or Claude code, 17:10 it's incredible how much you can achieve so quickly, 17:13 even for systems that are of medium to moderate scale. 17:17 So from my vantage point, it is a really exciting tool. 17:20 It's incredibly powerful. 17:21 And what I have found is that the LLMs are much better 17:24 when I teach them how to use tools and the tools that it's using 17:29 are actually really quick, fast ones that can give rapid feedback to the LLM 17:34 and tell it whether it's moving in the right direction or not. 17:36 Yeah, there's an engineering angle to this. 17:39 It's not just Vibe Coding if you take the time to learn it. 17:42 There was actually a very interesting study. I don't think the study itself has been released. 17:48 I haven't found it yet, but I saw a talk on it by some guys at Stanford. So they call it the 10K 17:53 developer study. And basically what they were doing was studying real code bases, including, 17:59 I think 80% of them were actually private code bases and seeing the point where the team started 18:05 adopting AI. And so their findings are really interesting and nuanced. And I think they probably 18:10 intuitively align with what a lot of us have experienced with AI. So basically, yes, there 18:16 are productivity boosts, but it produces a lot of code, but the code tends to be worse than the code 18:21 you would write and also introduces more bugs. So when you account for the time that you spend 18:27 refactoring and debugging, you're still more productive. But then it also depends on the 18:32 type of project, as Gregory was saying. So it's better for greenfield projects, it's better for 18:36 smaller code bases. It's better for simpler problems and it's better for more popular languages because 18:41 obviously there's more training data. And so this was actually, I like this study so much. I'll 18:46 actually share it with you, Michael, if you want to put it in the show notes, but it shows that, 18:50 yeah, the picture is not that simple and all this conflicting information and conflicting experiences 18:54 people were having line up completely with this. So again, like I work at an IDE company, it's tools 19:00 for the job. It's not like your IDE will replace you. AI is not going to replace you. It's just 19:06 going to make you maybe more productive sometimes. 19:08 Yeah. 19:09 Wait, IDE, you work for me. 19:11 Right. 19:12 It's not about you. 19:13 But then I work for the IDE. 19:18 This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry. 19:22 Let me ask you a question. 19:24 What if you could see into the future? 19:26 We're talking about Sentry, of course. 19:28 So that means seeing potential errors, crashes, and bugs before they happen, before you even 19:33 accept them into your code base. 19:35 That's what Sentry's AI Sears Code Review offers. 19:39 You get error prediction based on real production history. 19:43 AI Sear Code Review flags the most impactful errors your PR is likely to introduce before merge 19:50 using your app's error and performance context, not just generic LLM pattern matching. 19:55 Sear will then jump in on new PRs with feedback and warning if it finds any potential issues. 20:01 Here's a real example. 20:03 On a new PR related to a search feature in a web app, we see a comment from seer bicenturybot in the PR. 20:11 And it says, potential bug, the process search results function, can enter an infinite recursion when a search query finds no matches. 20:19 As the recursive call lacks a return statement and a proper termination condition. 20:24 And Seer AI Code Review also provides additional details which you can expand for further information on the issue and suggested fixes. 20:32 And bam, just like that, Seer AI Code Review has stopped a bug in its tracks without any 20:37 devs in the loop. 20:38 A nasty infinite loop bug never made it into production. 20:42 Here's how you set it up. 20:43 You enable the GitHub Sentry integration on your Sentry account, enable Seer AI on your 20:49 Sentry account, and on GitHub, you install the Seer by Sentry app and connect it to your 20:53 repositories that you want it to validate. 20:55 So jump over to Sentry and set up Code Review for yourself. 20:59 Just visit talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 21:03 The link is in your podcast player show notes and on the episode page. 21:06 Thank you to Sentry for supporting Talk Python and me. 21:10 I mean, the other thing is a lot of people and a lot of the sort of when people talk about AI 21:15 and LLMs and so forth in context of coding, it's the LLM writing code for us. 21:20 And maybe because I'm not doing a lot of serious coding, 21:23 it's more instruction and so forth. 21:25 I use it as like a sparring or brainstorming partner So it does, you know, checking of my newsletters for language and for tech edits and just sort of exploring ideas. 21:37 And for that, maybe it's because I do everything in the last minute and I don't have other people around or I'm lazy or cheap and don't want to pay them. 21:43 But definitely the quality of my work has improved dramatically. 21:46 The quality of my understanding has improved, even if it never wrote a line of code for me. 21:50 Just getting that feedback on a regular automatic basis is really helpful. 21:54 Yeah, I totally agree with you. 21:55 All right. We don't want to spend too much time on this topic, even though I believe Jody has put her finger on what might be the biggest tidal wave of 2025. 22:06 But still, a quick parting thoughts. Anyone else? 22:08 I'm glad I'll never have the right bash from scratch ever again. 22:12 Tell me about it. 22:13 Yeah. 22:15 I'll just say from anecdotally, the thing that I love about it is when I need to do something 22:22 and I need to go through docs, online docs for whatever it is, you know, it might be 22:28 GitLab or some library that I want to use or something like that. 22:32 I never even search for the docs. 22:33 I never even try to read the docs anymore. 22:35 I just say, hey, you know, whatever model I need to set up this website. 22:41 And I just, just tell me what to do or just do it. 22:43 And it's an immense time saver and productivity. 22:47 And then it gets me bootstrapped to the place where now I can start to be creative. 22:52 I don't have to worry about just like digging through pages and pages and pages of docs to 22:57 figure out one little setting here or there. 23:00 That's an amazing time saver. 23:02 Yeah, that's a really good point. 23:03 Another thing that I have noticed, there might be many things for which I had a really good 23:07 mental model, but my brain can only store so much information. 23:10 So for example, I know lots about the abstract syntax tree for Python, but I forget that 23:16 sometimes. 23:16 And so it's really nice for me to be able to bring that back into my mind quickly with 23:21 an LLM. 23:22 And if it's generating code for me that's doing a type of AST parsing, I can tell whether 23:27 that's good code or not because I can refresh that mental model. 23:30 So in those situations, it's not only the docs, but it's something that I used to know 23:35 really well that I have forgotten some of. 23:37 And the LLM often is very powerful when it comes to refreshing my memory and helping me to get started and move more quickly. 23:44 All right. Out of time, I think. Let's move on to Brett. What do you got, Brett? 23:48 Well, I actually originally said we should talk about AI, but Jody had a way better pitch for it than I did because my internal pitch was a little bit AI. 23:56 Do I actually have to write a paragraph explaining why? Then Jody actually did write the paragraph. So she did a much better job than I did. 24:01 So the other topic I had was using tools to run your Python code. 24:06 And what I mean by that is traditionally, if you think about it, 24:10 you install the Python interpreter, right? 24:13 Hopefully you create a virtual environment, install your dependencies, 24:16 and you call the Python interpreter in your virtual environment to run your code. 24:19 Those are all the steps you went through to run stuff. 24:21 But now we've got tools that will compress all that into a run command, 24:25 just do it all for you. 24:26 And it seems like the community has shown a level of comfort with that, 24:31 that I'd say snuck up on me a little bit, but I would say that I think it's a good thing, right? 24:37 It's showing us, I'm going to say us, as the junior core developer here on this call, 24:43 as to, sorry to make you too feel old, but admittedly, Barry did write my letter of recommendation 24:48 to my master's program. 24:51 So what happened was like, yeah, we had Hatch and PDM, 24:55 poetry before that, and uv as of last year, all kind of come through 24:59 and all kind of build on each other and take ideas from each other 25:02 and kind of just slowly build up this kind of repertoire of tool approaches 25:06 that they all kind of have a baseline kind of, not synergy is the right word, 25:09 but share just kind of approach to certain things with their own twists and added takes on things. 25:15 But in general, this whole like, you know what, you can just tell us to run this code 25:19 and we will just run it, right? 25:20 Like inline script metadata coming in and help making that more of a thing. 25:24 Disclaimer, I was the PEP delegate for getting that in. 25:27 But I just think that's been a really awesome trend And I'm hoping we can kind of leverage that a bit. 25:34 Like I have personal plans that we don't need to go into here, 25:36 but like I'm hoping as a Python core team, we can kind of like help boost this stuff up a bit 25:41 and kind of help keep a good baseline for this for everyone. 25:43 Because I think it's shown that Python is still really good for beginners. 25:45 You just have to give them the tools to kind of hide some of the details 25:49 to not shoot yourself in the foot and still leads to a great outcome. 25:52 Yeah, 2025 might be the year that the Python tools stepped outside of Python. 25:56 Instead of being, you install Python and then use the tools. 26:00 You do the tool to get Python, right? 26:02 Like uv and PDM and others. 26:03 Yeah, and inverted the dependency graph in terms of just how you put yourself in, right? 26:08 I think the interesting thing is these tools treat Python as an implementation detail almost, right? 26:13 Like when you just say uv or hatch run or PDM run thing, 26:17 these tools don't make you have to think about the interpreter. 26:19 It's just a thing that they pull in to make your code run, right? 26:22 It's not even necessarily something you have to care about if you choose not to. 26:26 And it's an interesting shift in that perspective, at least for me. 26:30 But I've also been doing this for a long time. 26:31 I think you're really onto something. 26:33 And what I love at sort of a high level is this, I think there's a renewed focus on the user experience. 26:40 And like uv plus the PEP 723, the inline metadata, you know, you can put uv in the shebang line of your script. 26:49 And now you don't have to think about anything. 26:52 You get uv from somewhere, and then it takes care of everything. 26:57 And Hatch can work the same way, I think, for developers. 27:01 But this renewed focus on installing your Python executable, 27:08 you don't really have to think about, because those things are very complicated, 27:12 and people just want to hit the ground running. 27:14 And so if you think about the previous discussion about AI, 27:18 I just want things to work. 27:20 I know what I want to do. 27:22 I can see it. 27:23 I can see the vision of it. 27:24 And I just don't want to. 27:25 An analogy is like when I first learned Python and I came from C++ and all those languages. 27:32 And I thought, oh my gosh, just to get like, hello world, 27:35 I have to do a million little things that I shouldn't have to do. 27:39 Like create a main and get my braces right and get all my variables right and get my pound includes correct. 27:46 And now I don't have to think about any of that stuff. 27:49 And the thing that was eye-opening for me with Python was the distance between vision of what I wanted and working code just really narrowed. 28:00 And I think that as we are starting to think about tools and environments and how to bootstrap all this stuff, we're also now taking all that stuff away. 28:09 Because people honestly don't care. 28:11 I don't care about any of that stuff. 28:13 I just want to go from like, I woke up this morning and had a cool idea and I just wanted to get at work. 28:18 Or you wanted to share it so you could just share the script and you don't have to say, 28:22 here's your steps that you get started with. 28:24 Exactly. 28:25 Exactly. 28:26 I want to thank the two of you for, oh, sorry, sorry, go ahead. 28:28 I'm just going to say, like, for years teaching Python that how do we get it installed? 28:34 At first, it surprised me how difficult it was for people. 28:37 Because like, oh, come on, we just got Python. 28:39 Like, what's so hard about this? 28:40 But it turns out it's a really big barrier to entry for newcomers. 28:45 And I'm very happy that Jupyter Lite now has solved its problems with input. 28:49 And it's like huge. 28:50 But until now, I hadn't really thought about starting with uv because it's cross-platform. 28:57 And if I say to people in the first 10 minutes of class, install uv for your platform and 29:02 then say uv in it, your project, bam, you're done. 29:05 It just works. 29:06 And then it works cross-platform. 29:07 This is mind-blowing. 29:08 And I'm going to try this at some point. 29:10 Thank you. 29:10 I can comment on the mind-blowing part because now when I teach undergraduate students, we 29:14 start with uv in the very first class. And it is awesome. There were things that would take students, 29:20 even very strong students who've had lots of experience, it would still take them a week to 29:26 set everything up on their new laptop and get everything ready and to understand all the key 29:30 concepts and know where something is in their path. And now we just say, install uv for your 29:36 operating system and get running on your computer. And then, hey, you're ready to go. And I don't have 29:42 teach them about docker containers and i don't have to tell them how to install python with some 29:47 package manager all of those things just work and i think from a learning perspective whether you're 29:52 in a class or whether you're in a company or whether you're teaching yourself uv is absolutely 29:58 awesome i'm actually wondering whether i am the one who is newest to python here i taught myself 30:05 python in 2011 so i was like python 2.7 stage but it was my first programming language i was just 30:12 procrastinating during my PhD. And I was like, I should learn to program. So I just taught myself 30:18 Python. And I can tell you, you do not come from an engineering background. And you're like, 30:23 what is Python? What is Python doing? Why am I typing Python to execute this hello world? And 30:29 if you're kind of curious, you get down a rabbit hole before you even get to the point where you're 30:33 just focusing on learning the basics. And so it's exactly, I was going to say with Reuven, 30:39 And like whether you thought about it for teaching, because we're now debating for Humble Data, 30:43 which is a beginner's data science community that I'm part of, whether we switch to uv. 30:48 This was Chuck's idea because it does abstract away all these details. 30:52 The debate I have is, is it too magic? 30:55 This is kind of the problem because I also remember learning about things like virtual 30:59 environments, because again, this was my first programming language and being like, 31:02 oh, it's a very good idea. 31:04 This is best practices. 31:05 And it's also a debate we have in PyCharm, right? 31:08 Like how much do you magic away the fundamentals versus making people think a little bit, but 31:15 I'm not sure. 31:15 All right. 31:15 Like, would you even let somebody run without a virtual environment? 31:19 That's like, that's a take you, that's a stance you could take. 31:21 I used to when I first learned Python, because it was too complicated, but then I learned 31:27 better. 31:28 But yes. 31:29 The consideration here is like hiding the magic isn't like hiding the details and having 31:34 all this magic just work is great as long as it works. 31:38 And the question is, how is it going to break down and how are people going to know how to deal 31:43 when it breaks down, if you hide all the magic? And I think virtual envs were, or let's say before 31:49 we had virtual envs, installing packages was very much in the, you had to know all the details 31:54 because it was very likely going to break down in some way right before we had virtual envs, 32:00 because you would end up with weird conflicts or multiple copies of a package installed in 32:04 different parts of the system. When we got virtual ends, we sort of didn't have to worry about that 32:10 anymore because we were trained in that you can just blow away the virtual one and it just works. 32:14 And with uv, we're back into, this looks like a single installation. We don't know what's going 32:19 to go on, but we've learned, we as a community and also the people working on uv, we have learned 32:25 from those earlier mistakes or not, maybe not mistakes, but consequences of the design. 32:32 And they have created something that is, that appears to be very stable where it's unlikely 32:38 the magic will break. 32:39 And when the magic does break, it's obvious what the problem is or, or it automatically 32:44 fixes itself. 32:45 So like it's not reusing, broken, installations and that kind of thing. 32:50 So the risk now, as it turns out, I think as is proven by the community adopting uv so 32:57 fast and so willingly, I think it's acceptable. 33:00 Well, I think it's, yeah, I think it's proven itself. 33:02 It's clear that this is, it's worth the potential of discovering weird edge cases later, both 33:09 because it's probably low likelihood, but also the people behind uv Astral have proven that 33:16 they would jump in and fix those issues, right? 33:18 They would do anything they need to keep uv workable the same way. 33:23 And they have a focus that Python as a whole cannot have because they cater to fewer use 33:28 cases than Python as a whole needs to. 33:31 On the audience, Galano says, as an enterprise tech director in Python coder, I believe we 33:36 should hide the magic which empowers the regular employee to do simple things that make their 33:40 job easier. 33:41 Yeah. 33:41 This notion of abstractions, right, has always been there in computer science. 33:47 And, you know, we've used tools or languages or systems where we've tried to bring that 33:53 abstraction layer up so that we don't have to think about all these details, as I mentioned 33:58 before. The question is, that's always the happy path. And when I'm trying to teach somebody 34:04 something like, here's how to use this library or here's how to use this tool, I try to be very 34:09 opinionated to keep people on that happy path. Like, assume everything's going to work just right. 34:15 Here's how you just make you go down that path to get the thing done that you want. The question 34:19 really is when things go wrong, how narrow is that abstraction? And are you able, and even when 34:27 you're just curious, like what's really going on underneath the hood? Of course, that's not a really 34:31 good analogy today because cars are basically computers on wheels that you can't really 34:36 understand how they work. But back in your day. But back in my day, we were changing spark plugs, 34:42 you know, but and crank that window down. Exactly. So I think we always have to leave that 34:50 room for the curious and the bad path where when things go wrong or when you're just like, 34:56 you know what, I understand how this works, but I'm kind of curious about what's really going on. 35:01 How easy is it for me to dive in and get a little bit more of that background, you know, 35:07 a little bit more of that understanding of what's going on. I want the magic to decompose, 35:12 right like you should be able to explain the magic path via a more decomposed steps using the tool 35:17 all the way down to what the tools like to do behind the scenes just just to admit i the reason 35:21 i brought this up and i've been thinking about this a lot is i'm thinking of trying to get the python 35:26 launcher to do a bit more because one interesting thing we haven't really brought up here is we're 35:31 all seeing uv uv uv uv is a company there's always there's they might disappear and we haven't 35:36 de-risked ourselves from that. Now we do have Hatch, we do have PDM, but as I said, there's kind 35:41 of a baseline I think they all share that I think they would be probably okay if the Python launcher 35:45 just did because that's based on standards, right? Because that's the other thing that there's been 35:48 a lot of work that has led to this step, right? Like we've gotten way more packaging standards, 35:52 we've got PEP 723, like we mentioned. There's a lot of work that's come up to lead to this point 35:58 that all these tools can lean on to have them all have an equivalent outcome because it's expected 36:03 is how they should be. 36:05 And so I think it's something we need to consider of how do we make sure, 36:09 like, by the way, uv, I know the people, they're great. 36:12 I'm not trying to spares them or think they're going to go away, 36:14 but it is something we have to consider. 36:16 And I will also say, Jody, I do think about this for teaching 36:20 because I'm a dad now and I don't want my kid coming home 36:24 when they get old enough to learn Python and go, hey, dad, 36:26 why is getting Python code running so hard? 36:29 So I want to make sure that that never happens. 36:32 But they fall in love with it from the start. 36:34 I realized something for the 2026 year interview. 36:37 I have to bring a sign that says time for next topic because we got a bunch of topics and we're running low on time. 36:43 So, Thomas, let's jump over to yours. 36:46 Oh, and I had two topics as well. 36:48 So I'm only going to have to pick my favorite child, right? 36:52 That's terrible. 36:53 My second favorite child is Lazy Imports, which is a relatively new development. 36:58 So we'll probably not get to that. 37:00 And just accepted. 37:00 Yes, it's been accepted and it's going to be awesome. 37:03 So I'll just give that a shout out and then move to my favorite child, which is free threaded 37:06 Python. 37:07 For those who were not aware, the global interpreter lock is going away. 37:12 I am stating it as a fact. 37:13 It's not actually a fact yet, but it, you know, that's because the steering council hasn't 37:18 realized the fact yet. 37:20 It is trending towards. 37:22 Well, I was originally on the steering council that accepted the proposal to add free threading 37:28 as a, as an experimental feature, we had this idea of adding it as experimental and then making it 37:34 supported, but not the default and then making it the default. And it was all a little vague and, 37:39 and up in the air. And then I didn't get reelected for the steering council last year, 37:44 which I was not sad about at all. I sort of ran on a, well, if there's nobody better, I'll do it, 37:49 but otherwise I have other things to do. And it turns out those other things were making sure that 37:54 prefer that Python landed in a supported state. So I lobbied the steering council quite hard, 38:00 as Barry might remember at the start of the year, to get some movement on this, like get some 38:04 decision going. So for Python 3.14, it is officially supported. The performance is great. It's like 38:10 between a couple of percent slower and 10% slower, depending on the hardware and the compiler that 38:16 you use. It's basically the same speed on macOS, which is really like it's, that's a combination of 38:23 the ARM hardware and Clang specializing things, but it's basically the same speed, which, wow. 38:29 And then on recent GCCs on Linux, it's like a couple of percent slower. The main problem is 38:35 really community adoption, getting third-party packages to update their extension modules for 38:40 the new APIs and the things that by necessity sort of broke, and also supporting free threading in a 38:48 in a good way and in packages for Python code, it turns out there's very few changes that 38:54 need to be made for things to work well under free threading. 38:57 They might not be entirely thread safe, but usually like almost always in cases where it 39:02 wasn't thread saved before either, because the guild doesn't actually affect thread safety. 39:07 Just the likelihood of things breaking. 39:09 I do think there's been a bit of a, the mindset of the Python community hasn't really been 39:14 focused on creating thread safe code because the GIL is supposed to protect us. 39:18 But soon as it takes multiple steps, then all of a sudden it's just less likely. 39:22 It's not that it couldn't happen. 39:23 Yeah, that's my point, right? 39:24 It's not the GIL never gave you threat safety. 39:27 The GIL gave cpythons internals threat safety. 39:31 It never really affected Python code and it very rarely affected thread safety in 39:36 extension modules as well. 39:37 So they already had to take care of, of making sure that the global interpreter 39:41 couldn't be released by something that they ended up calling indirectly so it's actually not that 39:46 hard to port most things to support free threading and the benefits we've seen some experimental 39:53 work because you know it's still it's still new there's still a lot of things that don't 39:56 quite support it there's still places where thread contention slows things things down a lot but 40:02 we've seen a lot of examples of really promising very parallel problems that now speed up by 10x or 40:09 more. And it's going to be really excited in the future. And it's in 2025 that this all started. 40:15 I mean, Sam started it earlier, but he's been working on this for years, but it landed in 2025. 40:21 It dropped its experimental stage in 314, basically. Yeah. I was going to say, were we all, 40:27 the three of us on the steering council at the same time when we decided to start the experiment 40:30 for free threading? I think Barry wasn't on it. Yeah, I missed a couple of years there, but I'm 40:36 Not sure. 40:36 No, I totally agree. 40:37 I think free threading is one of the most transformative developments for Python, certainly since Python 3, but even maybe more impactful because of the size of the community today. 40:49 Personally, you know, not necessarily speaking as a current or potentially former steering council member. 40:56 We'll see how that shakes out. 40:58 But I think it's inevitable. 41:00 I think free threading is absolutely the future of Python, and I think it's going to unlock incredible potential and performance. 41:08 I think we just have to do it right. 41:10 And so I talked to lots of teams who are building various software all over the community. 41:16 And I actually think it's more of an educational and maybe an outreach problem than it is a technological problem. 41:23 I mean, yes, there are probably APIs that are missing that will make people's lives easier. 41:30 There's probably some libraries that will make other code a little easier to write or whatever or to understand. 41:36 But like all that's solvable. 41:38 And I think really reaching out to the teams that are, you know, like Thomas said, 41:42 that are building the ecosystem, that are moving the ecosystem to a free threading world. 41:47 That's where we really need to spend our effort on. 41:50 And we'll get there. 41:51 It won't be that long. 41:52 It certainly won't be as long as it took us to get to Python 3. 41:56 I'm sort of curious as someone who's not super experienced with threading or, you know, basic concurrency. 42:04 I mean, I've used it, but I feel like now we have threads, especially with free threading and sub interpreters and multiprocessing and asyncio. 42:14 And I feel like for many people now it's like, oh, my God, which one am I supposed to use? 42:19 And for someone who's experienced, you can sort of say, well, this seems like a better choice. 42:24 But are there any plans to sort of try to have a taxonomy of what problems are solved by which of these? 42:31 The premise here is that everyone would be using one or more of these low-level techniques that you mentioned. 42:37 And I think that's not a good way of looking at it. 42:40 Like AsyncIO is a library that you want to use for the things that AsyncIO is good at. 42:46 And you can actually very nicely combine it with multiprocessing, with subprocesses, with 42:52 so that subprocesses and subinterpreters, just to make it clear that those are two very separate 42:57 things and multithreading, both with and without free threading. 43:01 And it solves different problems or it gives you different abilities within the AsyncIO 43:06 framework. 43:06 And the same is true for like GUI frameworks. 43:09 I mean, GUI frameworks usually want threads for multiple reasons, but you can use these 43:14 other things as well. 43:15 I don't think it's down to teaching end users when to use or avoid all these different things. 43:22 I think we need higher level abstractions for tasks that people want to solve. 43:27 And then those can decide on what for their particular use case is a better approach. 43:33 For instance, PyTorch has multiple. 43:36 So it's used for people who don't know to train, not just train, but it's used in AI 43:42 for generating large matrices and LLMs and what have you. 43:46 Part of it is loading data and processing. 43:49 And the basic ideas of AsyncIO are, oh, you can do all these things in parallel 43:55 because you're not waiting on the CPU, you're just waiting on IO. 43:58 Turns out it is still a good idea to use threads for massively parallel IO 44:02 because otherwise you end up waiting longer than you need to. 44:05 So a problem where we thought AsyncIO would be the solution 44:10 and we never needed threads is actually much improved if we tie in threads as well. 44:15 And we've seen massive, massive improvements in data loader. 44:19 There's even an article, a published article from some people at Meta 44:24 showing how much they improve the PyTorch data loader by using multiple threads. 44:29 But at a very low level, we don't want end users to need to make that choice, right? 44:33 I concur to futures is a good point, right? 44:35 Like all of these approaches are all supported there and it's a unified one. 44:39 So if you were to teach this, for instance, you could say use concurrent.tot futures. 44:42 These are all there. 44:44 This is the potential tradeoff. 44:45 Like basically use threads. 44:46 It's going to be the fastest unless there's like some module you have that's not that's 44:51 screwing up because of threads, then use sub interpreters. 44:53 And if for some reason sub interpreters don't work, you should move to the processing pool, 44:57 the process pool. 44:58 But I mean, basically, you just kind of just like, it's not go sort the fast stuff. 45:02 And for some reason, it doesn't work. 45:03 Use the next fastest and just kind of do it that way. 45:05 After that, then you start to the lower level. 45:08 Like, okay, why do I want to use subinterpreters instead of threads? 45:11 Those kinds of threads. 45:12 But I think that's a different, as I think we're all searching, 45:15 a different level of abstraction, which is a term we keep bringing up today. 45:19 It's a level that a lot of people are not going to have to care about. 45:21 I think the libraries are the ones that are going to have to care about this 45:23 and who are going to do a lot of this for you. 45:25 Let me throw this out on our way out the door to get to Reuven's topic. 45:29 I would love to see it solidify around async and await. 45:33 And you just await a thing, maybe put a decorator on something. 45:36 say this, this one, I want this to be threaded. I want this to be IO. I want this. And you don't, 45:42 you just use async and await and don't have to think about it, but that's, that's my dream. 45:46 Reuven, what's your dream? 45:48 Wow. How long do you have? 45:51 No, what's your topic? 45:52 So I want to talk about Python ecosystem and funding. When I talk to people with Python 45:59 and I talk to them about it, how it's open source, they're like, oh, right, it's open source. That 46:01 means I can download it for free. And from their perspective, that's sort of where it starts 46:05 and ends. And the notion that people work on it, the notion that needs funding, the notion that 46:10 there's a Python software foundation that supports a lot of these activities, the infrastructure 46:15 is completely unknown to them and even quite shocking for them to hear. But Python is in many 46:21 ways, I think, starting to become a victim of its own success, that we've been dependent on 46:27 companies for a number of years to support developers and development. And we've been 46:32 assuming that the PSF, which gives money out to lots of organizations to run conferences and 46:38 workshops and so forth, can sort of keep scaling up and that they will have enough funding. And 46:43 we've seen a few sort of shocks that system in the last year. Most recently, the PSF announced that 46:48 it was no longer going to be doing versus sort of pared down about a year ago, what it would give 46:52 money for. And then about five months ago, six months ago, I think it was in July or August, 46:56 they said, actually, we're not going to be able to fund anything for about a year now. 47:00 And then there was the government grant, I think from the NSF that they turned down. And I'm not disputing the reasons for that at all. It basically, it said, well, we'll give you the money if you don't worry about diversity and inclusion. And given that that's like a core part of what the PSF is supposed to do, they could not do that without shutting the doors, which would be kind of counterproductive. 47:17 And so I feel like we're not yet there, but we're sort of approaching this, I'm going to term like a problem crisis in funding Python. 47:27 The needs of the community keep growing and growing, whether it's workshops, whether it's PyPI, whether it's conferences. 47:32 And companies are getting squeezed. 47:35 And the number of people, it always shocks me every time there are PSF elections, the incredibly small number of people who vote. 47:42 Which means that, let's assume half the people who are members, third of the people. 47:46 Like for the millions and millions of people who program Python out there, an infinitesimally 47:50 small proportion of them actually join and help to fund it. 47:53 So I'm not quite sure what to do with this other than express concern. 47:57 But I feel like we've got to figure out ways to fund Python and the PSF in new ways that 48:01 will allow it to grow and scale as needed. 48:04 I couldn't agree more. 48:06 Obviously, the PSF is close to my heart because I was on the board for, I think, a total of 48:11 six or nine years or something over, you know, the last 25. 48:15 I was also for six months, I was the interim general manager because Eva left and we hadn't 48:21 hired Deb yet while I was on the board. 48:23 I remember signing the sponsor contracts for the companies that came in wanting to sponsor 48:29 Python. 48:29 And it is like, it's ridiculous how, and I can say this working for a company that is 48:35 one of the biggest sponsors of the PSF and has done so for years. 48:38 It's ridiculous how small those sponsorships are and yet how grateful we were that they 48:45 came in because every single one has such a big impact. 48:48 You can do so much good with the money that comes in. 48:52 We need more corporate sponsorships more than we need. 48:55 Like, I mean, obviously a million people giving us a couple of bucks, giving the PSF, let's 49:00 be clear. 49:00 I'm not on the board anymore. 49:01 Giving the PSF a couple of bucks would be fantastic. 49:05 But I think the big players in the big corporate players where all the AI money is, for instance, 49:12 having done basically no sponsorship of the PSF is mind-boggling. It is a textbook 49:18 tragedy of the commons right there, right? They rely entirely on PyPI and PyPI is run entirely 49:25 with community resources, mostly because of very generous and consistent sponsorship, 49:31 basically by Fastly, but also the other sponsors of the PSF. And yet very large players use those 49:38 resources more than anyone else and don't actually contribute. Georgie Kerr, she wrote this fantastic 49:45 blog post saying pretty much this straight after Europython. So Europython this year was really big 49:52 actually. And she was wandering around looking at the sponsor booths and the usual players were there, 49:57 but none of these AI companies were there. And the relationship actually between AI, if you want to 50:03 call it that. Let's call it ML and neural networks. And like some of the really big companies and 50:09 Python actually is really complex. Obviously, a lot of these companies and some of us are here, 50:15 employ people to work on Python. Companies like Meta and Google have contributed massively to 50:21 frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras. So it's not as simple a picture as saying cough up money 50:27 all the time. Like there's a more complex picture here, but definitely there are some notable 50:32 absences. And we talked about the volume of money going through. I totally agree with the sentiment. 50:39 When the shortfall came and the grants program had to shut down, we were brainstorming at JetBrains, 50:45 like maybe we can do some sort of, I don't know, donate some more money and call other companies 50:51 to do it. Or we can call on people in the community. And I was like, I don't want to call 50:55 on people in the community to do it because they're probably the same people who are also 50:59 donating their time for Python. Like it's just squeezing people who give so much of themselves 51:05 to this community even more. And it's not sustainable. Like Reuben said, if we keep doing 51:10 this, the whole community is going to collapse. Like I'm sure we've all had our own forms of 51:16 burnout from giving too much. I'm going to pat ourselves on the back here. Everyone on this 51:19 call who works at a company are all sponsors of the PSF. Thank goodness. But there's obviously a 51:25 lot of people not on this call who are not sponsors. And I know personally, I wished every 51:29 company that generated revenue from python usage donated to the psf like and it doesn't see and i 51:35 think part of the problem is some people think it has to be like a hundred thousand dollars it does 51:38 not have to be a hundred thousand dollars now if you can afford that amount please do or more there 51:43 are many ways to donate more than the maximum amount for getting on the website but it's one 51:48 of these funny things where a lot of people just like oh it's not me right like even startups don't 51:51 some do to give those ones credit but others don't because like oh we're we're burning through 51:56 capital level i was like yeah but we're not we're asking for like less so you'd pay a dev right by 52:01 a lot per year right like the amount we actually asked for to get to the highest tier is still less 52:07 than a common developer in silicon valley if we're gonna price point to a geograph geogra geographical 52:13 location we call kind of comprehend i'm gonna steal a net bachelor's observation here and yeah what 52:18 the psf would be happy with is less than a medium company spends on the tips of expensed meals every 52:25 year. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a long running problem, right? Like, I mean, I've been on the PSF for a 52:31 long time, too. I've not served as many years as Thomas on the board, but I was like executive 52:36 vice president because we had to have someone with that title at some point. It's always been a 52:40 struggle, right? Like I and I also want to be clear, I'm totally appreciative of where we have 52:45 gotten to, right? Because for the longest time, I was just dying for paid staff on the core team. 52:50 And now we have three developers as residents. Thank goodness. Still not enough to be clear. 52:55 I want five. 52:56 And I've always said that, but I'll happily take three. 52:58 But it's one of these things where it's a constant struggle. 53:00 And it got a little bit better before the pandemic 53:03 just because everyone was spending on conferences 53:05 and PyCon US is a big driver for the Python Software Foundation. 53:08 And I know your Python's a driver for the European Society. 53:12 But then COVID hit and conferences haven't picked back up. 53:15 And then there's a whole new cohort of companies that have come in post-pandemic 53:19 that have never had that experience of going to PyCon and sponsoring PyCon. 53:22 And so they don't think about, I think, sponsoring PyCon 53:25 the PSF because that's also a big kind of in your face, you should help sponsor this. 53:29 And I think it's led to this kind of lull where offered spending has gone down, new entrants 53:33 into the community have not had that experience and thought about it. And it's led to this kind 53:37 of dearth where, yeah, that PSF had to stop giving out grant money. And it sucks. And I would love 53:43 to see it not be that problem. I want to add one interesting data point that I discovered in 53:47 short. Keep it short. Yes. NumFocus has about twice the budget of the PSF. I was shocked to 53:53 discover this. So basically it is possible to get money from companies to sponsor development of 54:00 Python related projects. And I don't know what they're doing that we aren't. And I think it's 54:05 worth talking and figuring it out. We need a fundraiser and marketer in residence, maybe. Who 54:10 knows? Lauren does a great job, to be clear. The PSF has Lauren and Lauren is that. But it's still 54:18 hard. We have someone doing it full time at the PSF and it's just hard to get companies to give 54:22 cash up cash. 54:23 Yeah, and what do we get in return? 54:25 Well, we already get that. 54:26 So, yeah, I know. 54:27 All right, Barry. 54:28 To just, you know, shift gears into a different area, 54:32 something that I've been thinking a lot over this past year on the steering council. 54:36 Thomas, I'm sure, is going to be, you know, very well aware, 54:39 having been instrumental in the lazy imports PEP A10. 54:45 We have to sort of rethink how we evolve Python 54:50 and how we pose changes to Python and how we discuss those changes in the community. 54:56 Because I think one of the things that I have heard over and over and over again is that authoring PEPs 55:04 is incredibly difficult and emotionally draining and it's a time sink. 55:11 And leading those discussions on discuss.python.org, which we typically call DPO, 55:18 can be toxic at times and very difficult. 55:21 So one of the things that I realized as I was thinking about this 55:25 is that peps are 25 years old now, right? 55:29 So we've had this, and not only just peps are old, 55:33 but like we've gone through at least two, if not more sort of complete revolutions 55:38 in the way we discuss things. 55:40 You know, the community has grown incredibly. 55:43 The developer community is somewhat larger, but just the number of people 55:47 who are using Python and who have an interest in it has grown exponentially. So it has become 55:54 really difficult to evolve the language in the standard library and the interpreter. And we need 56:01 to sort of think about how we can make this easier for people and not lose the voice of the user. 56:09 And the number of people who actually engage in topics on DPO is the tip of the iceberg. You know, 56:14 We've got millions and millions of users out there in the world who, for example, lazy imports will affect, free threading will affect and don't even know that they have a voice. 56:24 And maybe we have to basically represent that, but we have to do it in a much more collaborative and positive way. 56:31 That's something that I've been thinking about a lot. 56:33 And whether or not I'm on the steering council next year, I think this is something that I'm going to spend some time on trying to think about, you know, talk to people about ways we can make this easier for everyone. 56:43 The diversity of use cases for Python in the last couple of years. 56:47 So complex. 56:48 Yes, exactly. 56:49 It should also be preface that Barry created the PEP process. He should have started that one. 56:55 It is that old. 56:57 Yeah. 56:58 By the way, just so everyone knows, these are not ages jokes to be mean to Barry. 57:02 We've always known Barry long enough that we know Barry's okay with us making these jokes. 57:07 To be very, very clear. 57:07 Also, I am almost as old as Barry, although I don't look as old as Barry. 57:12 Yeah, we're all over from the same age anyways. 57:15 Yeah, Barry and I have known each other for 25 years, 57:18 and I've always made these jokes of him. 57:21 So it is different when you know each other in person. 57:26 Let's put it that way. 57:28 For the PEP process, I think for a lot of people, it's not obvious how difficult the process is. 57:35 I mean, it wasn't even obvious to me. 57:37 I saw people avoiding writing peps multiple times, and I was upset, like on the steering council, right? 57:43 I saw people making changes where I thought, this is definitely something 57:47 that should have been discussed in a PEP and the discussion should be recorded in a PEP and all that. 57:51 And I didn't understand why they didn't until, basically until PEP 8.10. 57:56 So I did PEP 779, which was the giving free threading supported status 58:02 at the start of the year. 58:03 And the discussion there was, you know, sort of as expected and it's already, 58:08 was already an accepted PEP. 58:10 It was just the question of how does it become supported? 58:12 That one wasn't too exhausting. 58:14 And then we got to Lazy Imports, which was Pablo, who is another steering council member, 58:20 as well as a bunch of other contributors, including me and two of my co-workers and 58:24 one of my former co-workers, who had all had a lot of experience with Lazy Imports, but 58:29 not necessarily as much experience with the PEP process. 58:32 And Pablo took the front seat because he knew the PEP process and he's done like five PEPs 58:37 in the last year or something, some ridiculous number. 58:40 And he shared with us the vitriol he got for like offline for the, just the audacity of proposing 58:49 something that people disagreed with or something. And that was like, this is a technical suggestion. 58:54 This is not a code of conduct issue where I have received my fair share of vitriol around. 59:00 This is a technical discussion. And yet he gets this, these ridiculous accusations in his mailbox. 59:06 And for some reason, only the primary author gets it as well, which is just weird to me. 59:12 But people are lazy. 59:13 Thomas is what I think you just said. 59:15 Remember, the steering council exists because Guido was the got the brunt of this for Pet 572, which was the walrus operator. 59:24 Right. Which is just like this minor little syntactic thing that is kind of cool when you need it. 59:31 But like just the amount of anger and negative energy and vitriol that he got over that was enough to for him to just say, I'm out, you know, and you guys figure it out. 59:42 And that cannot be an acceptable way to discuss the evolution of the language. 59:48 Especially since apparently now every single PEP author of any contentious or semi contentious pep. 59:55 Although I have to say, Pep 810 had such broad support. 59:59 It was hard to call it contentious. 01:00:01 It's just there's a couple of very loud opinions, I guess. 01:00:04 And I'm not saying we shouldn't listen to people. 01:00:06 We should definitely listen to especially contrary opinions. 01:00:11 But there has to be a limit. 01:00:12 There has to be an acceptable way of bringing things up. 01:00:15 There has to be an acceptable way of saying, hey, you didn't actually read the Pep. 01:00:21 please go back and reconsider everything you said after you fully digested the things, 01:00:27 because everything's already been addressed in the pep. 01:00:29 It's just really hard to do this in a way that doesn't destroy the relationship with the person you're telling this, right? 01:00:37 It's hard to tell people, hey, I'm not going to listen to you because you haven't, you know, you've done a bad job. 01:00:44 You've chosen not to inform yourself. 01:00:46 I think you make another really strong point, Thomas, which is that there have been changes that have been made to Python that really should have been a pep. 01:00:55 And they aren't because people don't want to go through core developers, don't want to go through this gauntlet. 01:01:01 And so they'll create a PR and then that. 01:01:03 But that's also not good because then, you know, we don't have that. 01:01:06 We don't have the right level of consideration. 01:01:11 And you think about the way that, you know, if you're in your job and you're making a change to something in your job, you have a very close relationship to your teammates. 01:01:20 And so you have that kind of respect and hopefully, right, like compassion and consideration. 01:01:26 And you can have a very productive discussion about a thing and you may win some arguments and you may lose some arguments, but the team moves forward as one. 01:01:35 And I think we've lost a bit of that in Python. 01:01:38 So that's not great. 01:01:40 I think society in general could use a little more civility and kindness, especially to strangers that they haven't met in forums, social media, driving, you name it. 01:01:50 Okay, but we're not going to solve that here, I'm sure. 01:01:54 So instead, let's do Gregory's topic. 01:01:57 Hey, I'm going to change topics quite a bit, but I wanted to call 2025 the year of type checking and language server protocols. 01:02:04 So many of us probably have used tools like mypy to check to see if the types line up in our code or whether or not we happen to be overriding functions correctly. 01:02:14 And so I've used mypy for many years and loved the tool and had a great opportunity to chat with the creator of it. 01:02:20 And I integrate that into my CI and it's really been wonderful. 01:02:24 And I've also been using a lot of LSPs, like, for example, PyRite or PyLands. 01:02:28 But in this year, one of the things that we've seen is, number one, Pyrefly from the team at Meta. 01:02:34 We've also seen ty from the team at Astral. 01:02:36 And there's another one called Zubon. 01:02:38 And Zubon is from David Halter. 01:02:41 David was also the person who created JEDI, which is another system in Python that helped with a lot of LSP tasks. 01:02:48 What's interesting about all three of the tools that I just mentioned 01:02:51 is that they're implemented in Rust, and they have taken a lot of the opportunity to make the type checker 01:02:58 and or the LSP significantly faster. 01:03:01 So for me, this has changed how I use the LSP or the type checker and how frequently I use it. 01:03:07 And in my experience, it has helped me to take things that might take tens of seconds or hundreds of seconds and cut them down often to less than a second. 01:03:17 And it's really changed the way in which I'm using a lot of the tools like ty or Pyrefly or Zubon. 01:03:24 So I can have some more details if I'm allowed to share, Michael, but I would say 2025 is the year of type checkers and LSPs. 01:03:31 I think given the timing, let's have people give some feedback. 01:03:34 I personally have been using Pyrefly a ton and am a big fan of it. 01:03:38 I don't know if I'm allowed to have an opinion that isn't Pyrefly is awesome. 01:03:43 I mean, I'm not on the Pyrefly team, but I do regularly chat with people from the Pyrefly team. 01:03:49 Tell people real quick what it is, Thomas. 01:03:51 So Pyrefly is Meta's attempt at a Rust-based type checker. 01:03:56 And so it's very similar to ty. 01:03:58 Started basically at the same time, a little later. 01:04:01 Meta originally had a type checker called Pyre, which was written in OCaml. 01:04:06 They basically decided to start a rewrite in Rust. 01:04:09 And then that really took off. 01:04:11 And that's where we're going now. 01:04:13 Yeah. 01:04:14 Yeah. 01:04:14 I don't know what I can say because I'm actually on the same team as the Pylands team. 01:04:18 So, but no, I mean, I think it's good. 01:04:21 I think this is one of those interesting scenarios where some people realize like, 01:04:25 you know what, we're going to pay the penalty of writing a tool in a way that's faster, 01:04:30 but makes us go slower because the overall win for the community 01:04:33 is going to be a good win. 01:04:34 So it's worth that headache, right? 01:04:36 Not to say I don't want to scare people off from writing Rust, but let's be honest, 01:04:39 it takes more work to write Rust code than it does take to write Python code. 01:04:42 But some people chose to make that trade off and we're all benefiting from it. 01:04:46 The one thing I will say that's kind of interesting from this 01:04:48 that hasn't gotten a lot of play yet because it's still being developed, 01:04:51 But PyLens is actually working with the Pyrefly team to define a type server protocol, TSP, so that a lot of these type servers can just kind of feed the type information to a higher level LSP and let that LSP handle the stuff like symbol renaming and all that stuff. 01:05:05 Right. Because the key thing here and the reason there's so many different type checkers is there are there is a spec. 01:05:12 Right. And everyone's trying to implement it. But there's differences like in type in terms of type inferencing. 01:05:16 And if I actually go listen to Michael's interview, talk Python to me with the Pyrefly team, 01:05:21 they actually did a nice little explanation of the difference between Pyrites approach 01:05:25 and Pyrefly's approach. 01:05:27 And so there's a bit of variance. 01:05:28 But for instance, I think there's some talk now of trying to like, how do we make it 01:05:32 so everyone doesn't have to reimplement how to rename a symbol, right? 01:05:35 That's kind of boring. 01:05:35 That's not where the interesting work is. 01:05:37 And that's not performant from perspective of you want instantaneously to get that squiggly red line 01:05:43 in whether it's VS Code or it's in PyCharm or whatever your editor is, right? 01:05:48 You want to get it as fast as possible, but the rename- 01:05:51 Jupyter. 01:05:52 Jupyter. 01:05:52 No, not Emacs. 01:05:53 Everything but Emacs. 01:05:53 No, not Emacs. 01:05:56 Just to bring things full circle, it's that focus on user experience, right? 01:06:00 Which is, yes, you want that squiggly line, but when things go wrong, 01:06:04 when your type checker says, oh, you've got a problem, 01:06:07 you know, like I think about as an analogy, how Pablo has done an amazing amount of work 01:06:14 on the error reporting, right? 01:06:15 When you get an exception and, you know, now you have a lot more clues about what is it that I actually have to change to make the tool, you know, to fix the problem, right? 01:06:26 Like so many times years ago, you know, when people were using mypy, for example, and they'd have some complex failure of their type annotations and have absolutely no idea what to do about it. 01:06:40 And so getting to a place where now we're not just telling people you've done it wrong, 01:06:44 but also here's some ideas about how to fix it. 01:06:49 I think this is a full circle here because honestly, using typing in your Python code 01:06:54 gives a lot of context to the AI when you ask for help. 01:06:57 If you just give it a fragment and it can't work with it. 01:06:59 That's true. 01:07:00 And also, if you can teach your AI agent to use the type checkers and use the LSPs, 01:07:06 it will also generate better code for you. 01:07:09 I think the one challenge I would add to what Barry said a moment ago is that if you're a developer and you're using, say, three or four type checkers at the same time, you also have to be careful about the fact that some of them won't flag an error that the other one will flag. 01:07:24 So I've recently written Python programs and even built a tool with one of my students named Benedek that will automatically generate Python programs that will cause type checkers to disagree with each other. 01:07:39 I will flag it as an error, but none of the other tools will flag it as an error. 01:07:45 And there are also cases where the new tools will all agree with each other, but disagree with mypy. 01:07:50 So there is a type checker conformance test suite. 01:07:53 But I think as developers, even though it might be the year of LSP and type checker, 01:07:57 we also have to be aware of the fact that these tools are maturing and there's still disagreement among them. 01:08:03 and also just different philosophies when it comes to how to type check and how to infer. 01:08:08 And so we have to think about all of those things as these tools mature and become part of our ecosystem. 01:08:12 Yeah, Greg, that last point is important. 01:08:14 Out of curiosity, how did the things where the type checkers disagree 01:08:18 match up with the actual runtime behavior of Python? 01:08:21 Was it like false positives or false negatives? 01:08:24 That's a really good question. 01:08:26 I'll give you more details in the show notes because we actually have it in a GitHub repository 01:08:30 and I can share it with people. 01:08:31 But I think some of it might simply be related to cases where mypy is more conformant to the spec, but the other new tools are not as conformant. 01:08:43 So you can import overload from typing and then have a very overloaded function. 01:08:48 And mypy will actually flag the fact that it's an overloaded function with multiple signatures, whereas PyRite and Pyrefly and Zubon will not actually flag that, even though they should. 01:09:00 Another big area is optional versus not optional. 01:09:03 Yes. 01:09:03 Like, are you allowed to pass a thing that is an optional string when the thing accepts a string? 01:09:09 Some stuff's like, yeah, it's probably fine. 01:09:10 Others are like, no, no, no. 01:09:11 This is an error that you have to do a check. 01:09:13 And if you want to switch type checkers, you might end up with a thousand warnings that you didn't previously had because of an intentional difference of opinion on how strict to be, I think. 01:09:23 Yeah. 01:09:23 So you have to think about false positives and false negatives when you're willing to break the build because of a type error. 01:09:29 All of those things are things you have to factor in. 01:09:31 But to go quickly to this connection to AI, I know it's only recently, but the Pyrefly 01:09:37 team actually announced that they're making Pyrefly work directly with Pydantic AI. 01:09:42 So there's going to be an interoperability between those tools so that when you're building 01:09:46 an AI agent using Pydantic AI, you can also then have better guarantees when you're using 01:09:52 Pyrefly as your type checker. 01:09:53 It makes total sense, though, because then the reasoning LLM that's at the core of the 01:09:57 agent can actually have that information before it tries to execute the code and you don't get in that 01:10:04 loop that they often get in. You can correct it before it runs. Yeah, really good point. I want to 01:10:09 just sort of express my appreciation to all the people working on this typing stuff. As someone 01:10:14 who's come from many, many years in dynamic languages, I was always like, oh, typing. Those 01:10:27 E, I love seeing how easy it is for people to ease into it when they're in Python. 01:10:32 It's not all or nothing. 01:10:34 C, I love the huge number of tools. 01:10:36 The competition in this space is really exciting. 01:10:39 And D, guess what? 01:10:40 It really, really does help. 01:10:42 And I'll even add an E, which is my students who come from Java, C++, C#, and so forth 01:10:47 feel relief. 01:10:48 They find that without type checking, it's like doing a trapeze act without a safety 01:10:53 net. 01:10:53 And so they're very happy to have that typing in there, 01:10:57 typings in there. 01:10:58 So kudos to everyone. 01:10:59 All right, folks, we are out of time. 01:11:00 This could literally go for hours longer. 01:11:04 It was a big year. 01:11:05 It was a big year, but I think we need to just have a final word. 01:11:10 I'll start and we'll just go around. 01:11:12 So my final thought here is, we've talked about some things that are negatives 01:11:17 or sort of downers or whatever here and there, but I still think it's an incredibly exciting time 01:11:22 To be a developer, data scientist, there's so much opportunity out there. 01:11:26 There's so many things to learn and take advantage of and stay on top of. 01:11:29 And amazing. 01:11:30 Every day is slightly more amazing than the previous day. 01:11:33 So I love it. 01:11:34 Gregory, let's go to you next. 01:11:35 Let's go around the circle. 01:11:35 Yeah, I wanted to give a shout out to all of the local Python conferences. 01:11:40 I actually, on a regular basis, have attended the PyOhio conference. 01:11:44 And it is incredible. 01:11:45 The organizers do an absolutely amazing job. 01:11:49 And they have it hosted on a campus, oftentimes at Ohio State or Cleveland State University. 01:11:54 And incredibly, PyOhio is a free conference that anyone can attend with no registration fee. 01:12:01 So Michael, on a comment that I think is really positive, wow, I'm so excited about the regional 01:12:06 Python conferences that I've been able to attend. 01:12:08 Thomas. 01:12:09 Wow, I didn't expect this. 01:12:10 So I think I want to give a shout out to new people joining the community and also joining 01:12:16 just core developer team as triagers or it's just drive by commenters. I know we harped a little bit 01:12:22 about people, you know, giving strong opinions and discussions, but I always look to the far future 01:12:27 as well as the near future. And we always need new people. We need new ideas. We need new opinions. So 01:12:33 yeah, I'm, I'm excited that there's still people joining and signing up and even when it's 01:12:39 thankless work. So I guess I want to say thank you to people doing all the thankless work. Jodi. 01:12:44 Yeah, I want to say this is actually really only my third year or so really in the Python community. 01:12:52 So before that, I was just sort of on the fringes, right? 01:12:54 And after I started advocacy, I started going to the conferences and meeting people. 01:12:58 And I think I didn't kind of get how special the community was until I watched the Python documentary this year. 01:13:04 And I talked to Paul about this, Paul Everett afterwards, also made fun of him for his like early 2000s fashion. 01:13:11 but I think, yeah, like I'm a relative newcomer to this community and you've all made me feel so 01:13:18 welcome. And I guess I want to thank all the incumbents for everything you've done to make 01:13:24 this such a special tech community for minorities and everyone, newbies, you know, Python, 01:13:30 Python is love. Oh, geez. How am I supposed to follow that? 01:13:37 I think one of the interesting things that we're kind of looping on here is 01:13:41 I think the language evolution has slowed down, but it's obviously not stopped, right? 01:13:45 Like as Thomas pointed out, there's a lot more stuff happening behind the scenes. 01:13:49 Lazy imports are coming, and that was a syntactic change, which apparently brings out the mean side of some people. 01:13:55 And we've obviously got our challenges and stuff, but things are still going. 01:13:58 We're still looking along. 01:13:59 We're still trying to be an open, welcoming place for people like Jody and everyone else who's new coming on over 01:14:05 and to continue to be a fun place for all of us slightly grain-beard people who have been here for a long time 01:14:11 to make us want to stick around. 01:14:12 I think it's just more of the same, honestly. 01:14:15 It's all of us just continuing to do what we can to help out to keep this community being a great place. 01:14:20 And it all just keeps going forward. 01:14:22 And I'll just end with, if you work for a company that's not sponsored the PSF, 01:14:26 please do so. 01:14:26 It's rare to have, I mean, a programming language or any sort of tool 01:14:32 where it is both really, really beneficial to your career 01:14:36 and you get to hang out with really special, nice, interesting people. 01:14:40 And it's easy to take all that for granted if you've been steeped in the community. 01:14:45 I went to a conference about six months ago, a non-Python conference. 01:14:49 And that was shocking to me to discover that all the speakers were from advertisers and sponsors. 01:14:55 Everything was super commercialized. 01:14:57 People were not interested in just like hanging out and sharing with each other. 01:15:00 And it was a shock to me because I've been to basically only Python conferences for so many years. 01:15:05 I was like, oh, that's not the norm in the industry. 01:15:08 So we've got something really special going that not only is good for the people, but good for everyone's careers and mutually reinforcing and helping each other. 01:15:16 And that's really fantastic. 01:15:17 And we should appreciate that. 01:15:19 Barry, final word. 01:15:20 Thomas stole my thunder just a little bit, but just to tie a couple of these ideas together. 01:15:25 Python, and you know, Brett said this, right? 01:15:29 This is Python is the community or the community is Python. 01:15:33 There's no company that is telling anybody what Python should be. 01:15:38 Python is what we make it. 01:15:40 And, you know, as folks like myself get a little older and, you know, and we have younger people 01:15:47 coming into the community, both developers and everything else 01:15:51 who are shaping Python into their vision. 01:15:54 I encourage you, if you've thought about becoming a core dev, 01:15:58 find a mentor. 01:15:59 There are people out there that will help you. 01:16:01 If you want to be involved in the community, the PSF, you know, reach out. 01:16:06 There are people who will help guide you this community. You can be involved. Do not let any self-imposed limitations stop you from 01:16:16 becoming part of the Python community in the way that you want to. And eventually run for the 01:16:22 steering council because we need many, many, many more candidates next year. And you don't need any 01:16:29 qualifications either because I'm a high school dropout and I never went to college or anything. 01:16:34 And look at me. 01:16:35 And I have a PhD and I will tell you, I did not need all that to become a Python developer 01:16:39 because I was the Python developer before I got the PhD. 01:16:42 I'm a bass player. 01:16:43 So if I can do it, anybody can do it. 01:16:47 Thank you everyone for being here. 01:16:49 This awesome look back in the air and I really appreciate you all taking the time. 01:16:52 Thank you, Michael. 01:16:53 Thanks everybody. 01:16:54 Bye everybody. 01:16:57 This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me. 01:17:00 Thank you to our sponsors. 01:17:01 Be sure to check out what they're offering. 01:17:02 It really helps support the show. 01:17:04 Look into the future and see bugs before they make it to production. 01:17:08 Sentry's Seer AI Code Review uses historical error and performance information at Sentry 01:17:13 to find and flag bugs in your PRs before you even start to review them. 01:17:18 Stop bugs before they enter your code base. 01:17:20 Get started at talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 01:17:25 If you or your team needs to learn Python, we have over 270 hours of beginner and advanced courses 01:17:30 on topics ranging from complete beginners to async code, Flask, Django, HTMX, and even LLMs. 01:17:37 Best of all, there's no subscription in sight. 01:17:40 Browse the catalog at talkpython.fm. 01:17:42 And if you're not already subscribed to the show on your favorite podcast player, 01:17:46 what are you waiting for? 01:17:47 Just search for Python in your podcast player. 01:17:49 We should be right at the top. 01:17:51 If you enjoy that geeky rap song, you can download the full track. 01:17:54 The link is actually in your podcast blur show notes. 01:17:56 This is your host, Michael Kennedy. 01:17:58 Thank you so much for listening. 01:17:59 I really appreciate it. 01:18:01 I'll see you next time. 01:18:27 I think is the norm.

Indian markets are poised for a stronger financial year, with improving macros, low inflation, and reviving earnings growth expected to drive equities. Investors are reallocating between assets, with a focus on bottom-up stock selection and sectoral tailwinds. Opportunities are seen in financials, industrials, and defensives, while rate-sensitive segments and CDMOs offer further potential. Overall, Sonthalia believes FY27 could reward disciplined investors who focus on valuations, sectoral tailwinds and bottom-up stock selection rather than chasing crowded themes.

Title: Forecasting the world in 2026: Will Trump win the Nobel peace prize? Will Starmer survive?

The world on the brink of 2026 seems an especially unpredictable and unsettling place. Nonetheless, our team of crystal-ball gazers in The Irish Times have weighed in on what they think will happen in global affairs over the coming 12 months. Will they be right? We’ll find out next year. If you think you can do better than the experts, try submitting your predictions online – at the end of this article – and we’ll compare notes in 12 months, with a prize for our top performer. Happy 2026! – Carl O’Brien, Foreign Editor Yes. Though what form it will take is not clear, and whether it will hold is another matter. US president Donald Trump claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day, and is impatient over the continued absence of a peace agreement. Kyiv feels like it is now only one Trump tantrum away from losing US support entirely – including the military aid and intelligence that are a vital part of its war effort. Europe could fill many, if not all the holes, that an end to US support would leave, but Ukraine sees that Europe is divided and desperate to avoid confrontation with Trump. Add in Russia’s slow but relentless advance on the eastern battlefield, and Ukraine is more likely than not to have to agree to some sort of peace plan in 2026. Daniel McLaughlin, Eastern Europe Correspondent No. There are signs that carbon emissions are peaking but the expectation is they will plateau for at least a few years before slowly reducing. Much depends on China, which is on the cusp of cutting its emissions. But rising emissions elsewhere – the United States, India and Russia – would negate any early progress Beijing can orchestrate. Renewable energy is increasing but energy demand is growing as fast as renewables can expand, if not faster. Rapid growth in AI, increased air conditioning and refrigeration to counteract rising heat, the swelling world population and an expanding global middle class with an appetite for cars and consumer goods all require extra energy and fossil fuels are growing to supply it. If wildfires are as severe in the next 12 months as they have been in the past few years, they will also cancel out the efforts of countries that are actually reducing emissions. Caroline O’Doherty, Climate and Science Correspondent No. It is a marginal call and some Labour MPs believe he might scrape through, but I do not expect Starmer to be able to stand up in the political winds that will blow in 2026. Wales is a write-off for Labour and its 100-year grip on politics there will likely end in devolved parliament elections in May. Labour is also on course to lose in Scotland. But it could be London that finally does Starmer in. London council elections are due on the same day as the Welsh/Scottish votes. If the resurgent Greens eat into Labour’s London vote from the left, and Reform UK erodes it from the right, Starmer may be caught in an unsurvivable pincer grip. He will take the blame for everything. Starmer has been written off before and survived. But it would be a big surprise is he made it past the summer. Mark Paul, London Correspondent No. A row over Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s suggestion that her country could go to war to defend Taiwan has heightened tensions over the self-governing island. Beijing’s policy is to pursue unification, by force if necessary, and some analysts believe that Xi Jinping has been amping up the rhetoric to prepare the Chinese people for military action. Others think that Donald Trump would not send US forces to defend Taiwan, offering a Beijing a once in a lifetime opportunity to launch an invasion. But the island’s topography is such that an amphibious landing would be the most ambitious such operation in military history. And although the People’s Liberation Army is armed with the most advanced weapons technology, they have not been involved in a hot war since the 1970s. More likely are grey zone operations that make life difficult for the island but fall short of a blockade, which would be an act of war. Although polls show an overwhelming majority of Taiwanese oppose unification with the Chinese mainland, parties that want warmer relations with Beijing are gaining popularity. Denis Staunton, China Correspondent No. God, no. This is not merely a sporting endeavour for the land of hope and glory. It is about identity, esteem, obsession and neurosis. It means so much to the English, I believe – nay, as a facetious Irishman, hope – they will bottle it. The quest for a second World Cup 60 years after their first (and a mere aeon since they started talking about it) consumes the English like a case of national dysentery. That they go to the 2026 world cup with their hopes pinned on a German, England manager Thomas Tuchel, makes it worse. If England does win, nothing else will matter. Planets may collide, the seas may rise and a cow might jump over the moon. Keir Starmer could even survive as prime minister. The English won’t care – they will dance in the fountains of Trafalgar Square. It cannot be. Mark Paul, London Correspondent No. The US military build-up off Venezuela is formidable but nowhere near enough for an invasion. The current force is just one tenth the size of that which invaded Iraq in 2003 over land from Washington’s willing client Kuwait. A sea and air invasion of the much larger Venezuela would demand far more military assets than the war-averse president Trump is likely to sanction. The goal instead looks to be to try to force Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro into fleeing or provoke a coup against him from within his Chavista movement. Trump might also be attracted by the option of an opportunistic air strike. That risk-reward ratio would likely appeal far more to Trump than undertaking his country’s first invasion of a South American state. Tom Hennigan Yes. This year United States financial markets continued a years-long rally, shrugging off the disruption of the Trump administration’s tariffs and broader global uncertainty. The benchmark S&P index of US stocks has hit a record high, part of a years-long rally that began in spring 2022. Just a handful of companies account for most of this growth: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla. Together, they account for about a third of the S&P’s total value and a huge proportion of trading is just in the shares of those seven companies. Much of the rally is fuelled by hopes about the economic promise of AI. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in computing power and data centres to enable AI, which is hugely energy-hungry, but the expected revenues have largely failed to materialise. I’m convinced that the market for an over-hyped technology is not sustainable or resilient to the shocks of a more dangerous world, and is over-concentrated in just a few companies and centred around an over-hyped technology. Expecting the US stock market as a whole to always end up higher in the long run is based on a century of growth in which the US became the dominant global power and the living standards of its citizens were transformed. I’m not convinced the same can be expected of the next century. Naomi O’Leary No. It’s not impossible, but his chances are dimming. Much has happened since María Corina Machado, this year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner and the opposition leader in Venezuela, said in October that she is “grateful” for president Trump’s international diplomacy efforts. A fragile peace process continues to hold in Gaza. Against that, the US administration’s attempts to pressure Ukraine into an abomination of a peace deal with Russia and Trump’s continued emboldening of Vladimir Putin are facilitating the sense of threat sweeping through Europe. [ Venezuela’s Machado is backing Trump against Maduro - allies say they’ve tried everything elseOpens in new window ] The Nobel chair said Machado was recognised for her struggle to “achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy”. Trump’s political opponents within the US habitually present his administration as a threat to the tenets of democracy there, and the global disapproval of the peace prize awarded by Fifa president Gianni Infantino may dissuade the Nobel committee from entertaining his claims to the prize. But the Nobel Peace Prize honour roll is flawed and contentious and Trump will start 2026 as the bookies’ favourite. Keith Duggan, Washington Correspondent Yes. Germany’s car industry admits it missed the early turn-off to electric mobility. In 2022, VW, BMW and Mercedes looked on in horror as Elon Musk planted his first European factory just outside the gates of Berlin. But Germany’s car industry is not worried about Tesla any more. Instead, its eyes are fixed on a far more serious rival from the east. Chinese car giant BYD has its roots in batteries but now the auto division of Build Your Dreams is the stuff of nightmares for German car executives. After creeping into position in recent years, quietly attracting a loyal and price-conscious customer base in Europe, the Chinese company will move into high gear in October 2027. Its new factory in Hungary, with an initial capacity of 150,000 vehicles annually, will allow the Chinese firm circumvent EU tariffs on Chinese cars. Brussels describes the levies as a response to unfair state subsidies for its car companies. Not a moment too soon, VW will present its own entry-level EV next year, manufactured in Spain and starting at €25,000. If Germany’s car industry is to have a future, and the German economy with it, then this is the make-or-break moment. Derek Scally, Berlin Correspondent Yes – but only just. The US president is determined to begin phase two of the ceasefire in the new year but the challenges are immense, and 53 per cent of Israelis believe the war against Hamas will restart in 2026. Israeli forces remain in control of just over half of Gaza, along a “temporary” yellow line, which Israel’s top general termed a “new border” that would serve as a “forward defensive line for our communities”. There has been almost no discernible progress on any of the key elements of phase two of the ceasefire: Hamas remains dominant, albeit weakened, resisting calls to disarm; the militant group has still to return the body of the last remaining hostage; recruiting an international stabilisation force is problematic; Israel rejects any role for Turkey. In addition, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has still to carry out reforms; Israel rejects a role for the PA; and donors are reluctant to commit with so much uncertainty. Mark Weiss in Jerusalem Yes. As the year ends, Donald Trump’s presidential approval rating has tanked and the inflation crisis that dogged the Biden/Harris election campaign is now swamping the current administration, while Maga discontent is simmering over the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. The recent special elections in Virginia and New Jersey hinted at voting patterns in next year’s midterms. Internal tensions, symbolised by the disaffection of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the refusal by the Indiana state senate to accede to redistricting requests, and December’s candid Vanity Fair interview by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, all hint at an administration fragmenting. [ Amid ominous polls, Republicans start to express dissent towards Trump for the first timeOpens in new window ] But Republican efforts to manipulate the election process through a March executive order (blocked by the courts) to produce passports in order to vote, the continuing redistricting efforts, and fears that federal troops will be used in an attempt to deter voter turnout clouds all reasonable forecasts. The general consensus is that the number of winnable “Republican” seats is much smaller in 2026 than it was in the Democratic blue wave of 2018, and that gerrymandering on both sides has reduced the number of competitive districts. But nonetheless, the Democrats should retake the House majority. Keith Duggan, Washington Correspondent Yes. An irony – no doubt not lost on the newly-Catholic US vice-president JD Vance – is that the leader of his church (and an American), Pope Leo XIV, is increasingly seen as the world leader who is most outspoken and consistent in opposition to the policies of the Trump administration. This is likely to be even more the case in 2026. While other heads of state, prime ministers and dictators bow before Trump, fearing his deployment of tariffs, arms or the US Navy, Leo has done the opposite. From the beginning of his papacy, he has publicly criticised Trump’s treatment of migrants, his splitting with Europe, the betrayal of Ukraine, his threats to Venezuela, not to mention the US-enabled “barbarity” in Gaza. Asked about this in early December, Trump commented: “I’m sure he’s a lovely man. His brother’s [Louis] a lovely man ... Do you know his brother is serious Maga?” The US president, however, is likely to find he is dealing with a very different kettle of fish in “brother” Leo XIV. Patsy McGarry Yes. Although you will probably hear a lot of bluster from the Trump administration in 2026 about how the European Union’s regulations on big tech are unfair, it is unlikely this pushback will threaten the deal Brussels and Washington struck on tariffs. The EU agreed to 15 per cent tariffs on future goods sold into the US. EU negotiators blinked first, meaning we won’t know if Trump would have followed through on threats to hit Europe with cripplingly high import taxes, sparking a proper transatlantic trade war. Trump was able to sell the deal as a win for his radical tariff agenda. He seems content to bank it, even though his tariffs have put domestic prices and farmers under pressure. European politicians have been desperate to keep Trump onside as an ally of Ukraine, meaning they certainly won’t be the ones to rip up the tariff deal.

(Photo: AFP/Daniel de Carteret) PANAMA CITY: Near the entrance to the Panama Canal, a monument to China's contributions to the interoceanic waterway was torn down Saturday night (Dec 27) by order of local authorities. The move comes as US President Donald Trump has made threats in recent months to retake control of the canal, claiming Beijing has too much influence in its operations. In a surprising move that has been criticised by leaders in Panama and China, the mayor's office of the locality of Arraijan ordered the demolition of the monument built in 2004 to symbolise friendship between the countries. The mayor's office said in a statement that the monument, which overlooked the waterway spanning Bridge of the Americas, had structural damage that posed a "risk".

Title: From AI To SPO: The Top 10 AdExchanger Guest Columns Of 2025
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/opinion/from-ai-to-spo-the-top-10-adexchanger-guest-columns-of-2025/
Time Published: 2025-12-29T05:45:38Z

Competition between DSPs and SSPs was extra spicy this year. The Trade Desk’s aggressive posture against SSPs – which it branded as “resellers” contributing little to the programmatic supply chain – sparked countless hot takes on ad industry social media channels and in AdExchanger columns. Thought leaders also had plenty to say about increased competition among DSPs themselves, as well as SSPs’ efforts to beat the perception that they’ve become commodified and interchangeable. And supply-path optimization (SPO) and competition in the middle of the programmatic marketplace were front and center for AdExchanger’s guest contributors. Of course, the hottest topic across all industries – generative AI – drove a ton of thoughtful chatter from contributors, with advertisers attempting to separate the hype from reality. And some evergreen industry obsessions – like brand safety, media quality and the need to prove outcomes from ad campaigns – remained top of mind. Here’s our rundown of the top 10 most popular guest columns of 2025 and why they resonated. 1. The Trade Desk’s Blue Ocean Moment: How The DSP Can Rewrite Ad Tech’s Rules By Danilo Tauro, Aperiam Ventures While The Trade Desk made news with its tough stance on SSPs, its efforts to remain competitive with its Big Tech rivals Google, Amazon and Meta also attracted a ton of industry attention. Wall Street, in particular, seemed dissatisfied with TTD’s lack of urgency in the face of growing competition from Amazon DSP, resulting in TTD’s stock price trending downward this year. TTD is missing its true blue ocean opportunity to compete with the walled gardens, Tauro wrote. Instead of chasing CTV inventory or data, which are the specialties of platforms like Google and Amazon, he advised TTD to double down on what Big Tech can’t: independence and accountability. 2. SSPs Are Facing Extinction – And Only Bold Differentiation Can Save Them By Scott Young, Transmit Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. The hard truth behind The Trade Desk branding all SSPs as resellers that need to be cut from the supply chain? Many in the industry agreed. The perception that SSPs are interchangeable and, therefore, expendable, was caused by their efforts to be platform-agnostic, argued Young. He advised SSPs to differentiate themselves by focusing on their original value proposition: increasing publishers’ ad revenue yield. 3. The Death Of The DSP? How Ad Tech’s Cash Flow Crisis Threatens The Entire Ecosystem By Chris Pettit, Revving Microsoft shutting down its DSP (formerly known as Xandr and AppNexus) in May proved that competition isn’t just getting tougher among SSPs. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s move brought back bad memories of unpaid debts caused by the demise of MediaMath, another once-ascendent DSP, back in 2023. When DSPs go out of business, the entire supply chain has to deal with the repercussions. So, publishers, SSPs and other industry stakeholders should prioritize liquidity on their own terms, Pettit wrote. It’s a pretty convenient argument coming from the CEO of a cash-flow management company. But Pettit shed light on a fundamental weakness baked into the programmatic supply chain – one that’s clearly a cause for concern among industry experts. 4. Marketing To Machines: A New Performance Strategy In The Age Of AI Agents By Michael Lehman, Nativo Consumers just don’t click links like they used to. And publishers – and brands alike – have had to adjust to shifting content discovery habits. Simply put, the old SEO playbook is obsolete, argued Lehman. Generative engine optimization (GEO) is the new SEO. And brands that want exposure in search results need to ensure they’re top of mind for AI chatbots. 5. Goodbye, Outcomes Era: Why Quality Will Define The Industry’s Future By Erez Levin, Emet Advisory As we entered 2025, much of the ad industry conversation centered on the idea that digital advertising was firmly in its “Outcomes Era.” Marketers had become laser focused on proving that campaigns produced concrete results, rather than chasing vanity ad tech metrics like viewability. But marketers’ obsession with outcomes is nothing new, Levin wrote, and it’s exactly what led them to chase vanity metrics in the first place. Plus, this fixation on performance has encouraged all kinds of attribution shenanigans, with powerful advertising platforms claiming credit for conversions even if their impact on the consumer’s decision was hard to prove. According to Levin, the better path forward for the industry is to focus on high-quality media and forging close partnerships with premium publishers that command the trust of their audiences. 6. Why Meta’s Exit From MRC Audits Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Marketers By Nicole Scaglione, PubMatic Brand safety is a constant concern for marketers and publishers. But it’s perhaps less of a concern for big social media platforms, who are handing content moderation over to automated systems and community feedback while embracing a flood of AI slop. Meta made social media’s priorities clear in October when it withdrew from the Media Ratings Council’s brand safety audits altogether. These trends should cause marketers to reconsider their commitments to social video, argued PubMatic’s resident video expert – especially as programmatic CTV opens up more premium, brand-safe options. 7. The Brand Safety Myth: Why Most Marketers Don’t Need Brand Safety Verification By Michal Fuchs, Zoomd Speaking of brand safety, maybe marketers don’t need brand safety verification for every campaign use case. Relying on verification vendors for avoiding invalid traffic and outright fraud remains important, argued Fuchs. But most advertisers don’t need to verify every single ad impression as brand safe, and doing so is probably causing more harm than good. 8. AI Is Everywhere, But Where Is It Really Adding Value? By Angelina Eng, IAB The ad industry has a tendency to rush into adopting shiny new technologies, argued Eng. That tendency is a huge risk when it comes to much-hyped but still disproven AI applications. To avoid making the same mistake with generative and agentic AI, Eng offered advice for how advertisers can test these emerging technologies with discipline and an emphasis on clear business objectives. 9. The 7 Traits Every Ad Tech Leader Needs To Thrive In The Age Of AI By Ann Blinkhorn, Blinkhorn LLC and Randall Rothenberg, Randall, Ltd. Winning in advertising’s AI era will require leadership to develop entirely new skill sets. Two ad tech OGs with plenty of experience mentoring industry executives polled some of the top minds in digital advertising to see which traits they think will distinguish the next generation of leaders. 10. Closing The CTV Outcome Data Gap: Unlocking Smarter Optimization Strategies By Cintia Gabilan, IAB While plenty of big-picture topics dominated industry discussion this year, the nuts and bolts of running ad campaigns and measuring outcomes remained just as important as ever. CTV is digital advertising’s hottest media channel, but it’s also one of the more inscrutable ones when it comes to measuring campaign performance. In this column, Gabilan detailed the difficulties industry groups face in creating a standardized conversion API for CTV – but why developing one is essential for the future of campaign measurement.

President Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy met to discuss a new peace plan. Zelenskyy called it a great meeting, suggesting a deal is near. However, Russia's aides dismissed several proposals.

Title: Streamer Report Card: Streaming Reached A Profit Turning Point In 2025, But Major Players Still Wonder How To Measure Success
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/12/streaming-report-card-2025-1236651338/
Time Published: 2025-12-28T20:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Dade Hayes, Katie Campione After more than five years of gushing red ink, 2025 was the year when streaming across the board started to turn a profit. There are caveats attached to that statement, of course. NBCUniversal’s Peacock is still making losses, and Apple TV’s economics are impossible to disentangle from its trillion-dollar parent company’s, but nevertheless the year in general will go down as a milestone. With that long-sought economic maturity has come greater scrutiny of the balance sheet. Although it sometimes feels like streaming is the only arena that counts, a recent report from Morgan Stanley media analysts noted that spending on linear TV remains about double that on streaming. Gone are the days of the firehose of content; even the sector leader, Netflix, has held the line on content expenses of late. In 2026, Morgan Stanley predicts, “streaming market repair” will be a key phrase across the sector, as “corporate spin-offs and continued cord-cutting are rapidly shrinking legacy TV as an investment factor.” Watch on Deadline Streaming remained a headline-grabber this year even before a game-changing deal centering on the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (with Netflix and Paramount both in hot pursuit as of this writing) was finalized. Disney launched a beefed up new ESPN app, which blends linear feeds from more than a dozen of its networks with a range of streaming-only fare. Fox Corp., for similar strategic reasons, launched its own flagship, Fox One. While profits and losses are probably the ultimate measure of success, the metrics of streaming underwent a rethink this year, with Netflix and Disney announcing plans to phase out quarterly reports of subscriber numbers. Revenue per user, engagement and other metrics are now en vogue, though success or failure in streaming, as ever, is subject to interpretation. Below, in alphabetical order, are the top streaming players and Deadline’s view about how they fared in 2025 as well as what they’re facing next year. This is intended as a comprehensive look at these services – programming, product and overall status in the field, not just value as M&A chess pieces. 2025 Highlight: Severance. The show returned for its second season this year and quickly became both a critical and cultural darling. It earned 27 Emmy nominations and won eight, including Outstanding Lead Actress for Britt Lower and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Tramell Tillman. The streamer is also closing out the year on a high note with Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus, which is already shaping up to be a strong awards contender after earning Rhea Seehorn a Golden Globe nomination. It would be wrong not to acknowledge that F1 scored Apple’s biggest ever box office opening this year, too, via a distribution deal with Warner Bros. 2025 Lowlight: The streaming era has brought about many conundrums, and one that it appears has confounded multiple media companies is what the heck to call their service. While not nearly as egregious as the HBO Max debacle, Apple TV quietly rebranded earlier this year too, removing the “+” sign due to apparent confusion it caused. The problem? It only created more confusion, given that Apple TV is also the name of the streaming hardware it sells, as well as the name of the app within the device. Challenge for 2026: Eddy Cue, Senior Vice President of Services at Apple, admitted in October that the streamer has experienced a few setbacks that have left it “a little further behind than where I’d like to be.” While he pushed back on claims that the service’s subscriber numbers sit around 45M, arguing that it is “significantly more than that,” the point remains that Apple seems to still be small potatoes in the streaming world despite some heavyweight content. The streamer’s financials are reported as part of Apple’s overall services business, lumping them in with music, cloud storage and other operations, but the streamer clearly seems to have a ways to go before it’s in the big leagues. Biggest question for 2026: What is the tech giant’s next move in streaming? As all the chess pieces are moving rapidly across the board, Apple is a peculiar one that seems to have removed itself from the whims of the streaming wars. Apple TV remains the only premium streaming service without an ad tier. The company is also decidedly not joining the furor over Warner Bros. So, it begs the question, will Apple make any big moves next year, or quietly stick to what works? 2025 Highlight: ESPN’s streaming service finally has something to offer. For years, Disney’s sports streaming efforts were hindered by fragmented rights that made it nearly impossible to watch consequential games on its ESPN+ app, but the Mouse House finally upped its game in 2025. After acquiring NFL Network/RedZone, ESPN launched a brand new comprehensive streaming service in August that offered not only every Monday Night Football matchup across both ESPN and ABC this season but a ton of other streaming-exclusive games as well. The WWE also began offering premium live events on ESPN’s app as well. 2025 Lowlight: Although it wasn’t exclusively related to streaming, Disney’s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air while facing pressure from the Trump administration was a lowlight for democracy and may have had a negative effect on public perception of the company across the board. Campaigns circulated online encouraging Disney+ and Hulu subscribers to ditch their plans. Independent data reports have estimated millions of Americans canceled their subscriptions in that aftermath, though the economic fallout is hard to quantify. Disney is about to stop reporting streaming subscriber numbers in quarterly earnings reports, so the full impact of that backlash may not be known, since only a portion of those effects were documented in the company’s Q4 earnings. Regardless, it was yet another year of controversy for Disney. Challenge for 2026: Stay in consumers’ good graces. This year was as tumultuous as ever for Disney, and 2026 looks to present its own challenges as the company looks to dip its toes further into user-generated AI content. That ventures could go either way, as consumer sentiment specifically around AI is constantly shifting, but any rollout will surely spark backlash from the creative community. The one thing that is clear is that Disney could benefit from a little less turbulence with consumers in 2026, so it should proceed with caution. Biggest question for 2026: Disney isn’t the only company to tease AI-generated content might soon be available on its streaming platforms, but it certainly has the biggest IP to work from in that regard. After inking a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, how might Disney’s AI ambitions intersect with its streaming offerings in 2026? 2025 Highlight: Becoming the belle of the ball. While HBO Max had gradually earned a place among the top handful of services since its problematic launch in 2020, that uphill climb has gained a big tailwind with the acquisition interest by Netflix and Paramount. While either company taking over would mean more upheaval for a company that has cycled through three owners in a decade, for the streaming business the injection of resources will be dramatic – at least until Netflix merges it out of existence. 2025 Lowlight: The rebranding fiasco of Max going back to HBO Max. While senior execs gamely tried to own the mistake when revealing the revamp at the company’s upfront presentation last May, it still belongs in the corporate annals next to New Coke and Qwikster. Challenge for 2026: Now that it has finally made it to long-forbidden territories like the UK, Germany and Italy (which were unavailable due to a Sky output deal), what can HBO Max make of it? Netflix has become Netflix by incubating global hits from non-U.S. territories. HBO Max should lean into its prestige reputation and take a page from that playbook. Biggest question for 2026: Can movies throw around more weight? As solid a hit as Superman and other releases were in theaters during Warner Bros.’ best year in ages (not to mention Materialists and other A24 releases making their debuts on HBO Max), they made minimal waves in streaming. With Harry Potter set to rekindle interest in the film franchise with a series take due in 2027, the clout of movies could be HBO Max’s not-so-secret weapon. 2025 Highlight: K-pop Demon Hunters. The roaring success of Sony’s animated musical, which landed at the streaming giant under the companies’ pay-1 output deal, gave Netflix something it has been craving: a bona fide franchise. Riding a tide of pop-culture goodwill, a sing-along version of the movie raked in $19.2 million last fall, topping the weekend box office charts. The film also just recently surpassed 500M views on Netflix. 2025 Lowlight: Yet another video game course-correction. Co-CEO Greg Peters, who has overseen the games effort since it began in earnest in 2022, has not tried to put lipstick on a pig. But this year saw the latest strategic shift away from pricey franchise plays and toward casual games suited to the living room. Last fall, Peters made the news personally at an L.A. conference that an adaptation of the board game Boggle was joining the lineup. While the overall business had a banner year, that damp squib of an announcement seemed to sum up the entire gaming misadventure. Challenge for 2026: How can management keep the troops focused as they pursue Warner Bros.? At $82.7 billion, the deal would be exponentially larger than any prior M&A transaction in the company’s nearly three-decade history. The most important task for Peters, Ted Sarandos and other top execs is keeping the industry-leading operation humming. Biggest question for 2026: Will the movie portfolio undergo any more changes under film chairman Dan Lin? The producer and former Warner exec was installed in mid-2024, so his fingerprints may not yet be evident on a recent slate marked by Frankenstein, Electric State, A House of Dynamite, Jay Kelly, and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Lin’s best-known credits include The Lego Movie, It, and other properties with profiles that stand out from Netflix’s recent output. 2025 Highlight: Taylor Sheridan, aka Paramount’s golden goose, kept filling the basket. New seasons of Landman, Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown clicked with viewers, as did MobLand, which wasn’t created by Sheridan but was exec produced by his close collaborator, David Glasser. Despite the upheaval of the merger with Skydance, which closed in August and entailed thousands of layoffs, the content kept flowing. 2025 Lowlight: Losing Taylor Sheridan. With more than three years left on his overall deal with Paramount, the Yellowstone creator announced he would segue to NBCUniversal in 2029. Of course, there is spin on both sides, especially with high-priced talent deals under a microscope across the industry. But the notion that newly minted CEO David Ellison spent time courting Sheridan and came up empty didn’t send the ideal signal to the troops. Challenge for 2026: Ordering off the menu. While Sheridan’s world, South Park, the UFC, CBS programming (including the NFL) and Paramount movies are continuing to be marquee draws for the streaming service, it needs to break new ground if it’s going to muscle its way into the top echelon. Should the WBD quest or other M&A deals bear fruit, they would be a quick route to scale. Regardless, Netflix alum Cindy Holland and her troops will need to come up with an equivalent to Orange is the New Black or the many other follow-ups to House of Cards she presided over in her old job. Those originals positioned Netflix as not just intriguing but essential. Biggest question for 2026: Will David Ellison’s long-promised tech overhaul of Paramount+, with or without the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, bear fruit in the new year? Since the media business set off on the expensive path of chasing Netflix nearly a decade ago, it has made a number of investments that were billed as pixie dust capable of transforming them into true tech giants. AI is the latest element said to confer such power. Technology is ever-present in the ecosystem, so the fact that it exists isn’t new. The main question facing Ellison & Co. is: How will they use it? 2025 Highlight: Love Island USA. Peacock had a lot riding on Season 7 after the reality show finally took off last year, and, boy, did it deliver. The season broke every viewership record it possibly could, becoming Peacock’s most-watched original season ever with 18B minutes viewed throughout the two months it aired this summer. For better or worse, the show was everywhere, and so were its contestants. Notable wins on the scripted front: The Paper and All Her Fault both performed quite well. The Office spinoff was renewed before the episodes even hit the streamer, and All Her Fault topped the Luminate weekly TV rankings in the week it premiered. It was the first time that a Peacock original series had been No. 1 since the Luminate rankings were introduced. 2025 Lowlight: Ads, ads, and more ads. Every major premium streaming platform, save for Apple, has introduced an ad-tier by this point. So, why does Peacock’s approach to ads feel particularly obnoxious? NBCUniversal recently touted “arrival ads,” which will bombard users with an ad as soon as they log onto the platform. The company also says it’ll use AI tools to scan live content and place ads at pivotal moments with which “advertiser’s ad or creative automatically aligns.” Think big moments, like when a team hits the 10-yard line – aka, the time when a viewer would arguably be most agitated by being confronted with an ad. (NBCU execs said at a press briefing this month that the spots will not interrupt the live action but will look to draft off them when a break comes.) Challenge for 2026: Peacock has certainly had its moments, but is it considered a must-have? Having canceleld Poker Face, Based on a True Story, and more this year, the streamer just doesn’t seem to be winning viewers over with its scripted content. The looming sale of WB to one of NBCUniversal’s rivals, Netflix or Paramount, would supercharge either of those studios’ content libraries and could potentially be spell bad news for Peacock, unless it can hold out until 2029 when Taylor Sheridan arrives. Biggest question for 2026: Can sports be its saving grace? A three-year rights deal with bring the MLB to NBC and Peacock in 2026, and the platform will also host the Winter Olympics in February. Peacock also just began streaming WNBA coverage in addition to its ongoing Premier League, NFL and NBA coverage. Oh, and since NBC is hosting the Super Bowl, Peacock will simulcast that as well. While the streamer has yet to make itself essential in the scripted content space, sports buffs would be hard pressed not to have it. 2025 Highlight: The twin home runs of The Summer I Turned Pretty and Thursday Night Football. The third and final season of Jenny Han’s young adult romance came roaring back to the streamer this summer with an audience unlike anything it had ever seen before. Per Prime Video, it amassed 70M viewers globally in 70 days. On the NFL front, Prime Video’s fourth season of TNF is up 13% over last year, marking a third straight season of double-digit growth. 2025 Lowlight: Amazon canceled a lot of series this year including Étoile, Butterfly, Countdown, Bosch: Legacy, Motorheads, The Wheel of Time, Cruel Intentions, and The Runarounds. Lots of arguments to be made as to why any or all of these series should or should not have been canceled, but it’s becoming pretty clear that frequent cancellations negatively impacts consumer sentiment. Challenge for 2026: Prime Video ended the year with the return of Fallout, and Season 2 of Mr & Mrs Smith is delayed indefinitely, leaving just a few heavy hitting scripted series to come in 2026. The Boys set to end next year with its fifth and final season, and Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will also return (although, the latter’s second season struggled significantly compared to the first, so Season 3’s performance isn’t a sure bet, either). Given all the cancellations listed above, Prime Video may be hard pressed to make a mark with anything new in 2026. Titles to keep an eye on is the Legally Blonde prequel series, Elle, and the Michelle Yeoh-led Blade Runner 2099. Biggest question for 2026: Will Amazon finally become the one-stop content discovery hub? Analysts’ predictions indicate that the tech giant might eventually introduce a universal search experience that allows users to navigate directly to other external streaming services to watch content. The streamer already quietly introduced a “news hub” that aggregates content from across hundreds of news channels, signaling its desire to become the central online marketplace for not just goods, but entertainment, too.

Comment Name Email Website Δ There are too many major streamers now, okay. Peacock needs to go away, Comcast has failed. When HBO Max merges with either Netflix or Paramount+, that will leave an array of streamers that can survive just fine. If Apple wanted to be in the big leagues, they would need to produce the kind of schlock Netflix does. Bottom feeding “documentaries” about serial killers, frothy romcom fantasy, teen angst, supernatural horror. Prestige drama about rich white people behaving badly and head-scratching sci fi will only get you so far. I hope Apple doesn’t start slumming. We have enough of that. If no longer reporting subscriber numbers, Streamers still have to report the specific income from the service itself, no? Could you not do the math to at least estimate how many subscribers they are getting from that? For Paramount, is Star Trek no longer a factor? South Park is mentioned over this? I know that there has been some criticism of Star Trek shows, but it can’t be that bad. Are people that stupid they can’t keep up with streamer rebranding? Do they really care? It’s like saying people are confused by the difference between an apple you eat and the company that makes phones. Speaking of Apple, how many are getting Apple streaming for free by buying an Apple product? Do they offer free subscriptions when doing so? Here is a possibly odd question: What, if anything, does it cost a streamer to run and maintain the servers providing subscribers their content 24/7? We are now hearing about AI data centers resulting in consumers paying higher electric bills. Are not streaming “data centers” somewhat the same even if not as energy hungry? Is raising subscription prices partly due to running these centers? Is canceling, or even removing, content few, if anyone, is watching, a way to save money by recycling wasted space? Has anyone thought of this? You’d have to also estimate ARPU, which varies throughout the world. For Netflix, ARPU in Asia is about half that of North America. So if Netflix adds a lot of Asian subscribers but doesn’t report subscriber figures, regional breakdown or regional ARPU, then guestimating their figures becomes dicey. And then add in the ad-based tiers, which on the surface is less revenue but actually more when you add in the ad revenue. Ad tiers are generally more lucrative than ad-free ones, which is why the streamers push them. The kind of servers Netflix has, just to serve up video, are much less power intensive than AI servers. Platforms remove content in order not to pay licensing fees on that content. The server space is a small consideration. However, Disney’s move into user generated AI content suggests that AI type servers will become far more of a factor in the future. I expect user generated content to make inroads into all the platforms, except for Apple, because prestige content without big franchises doesn’t mesh with AI nearly as well as the opposite. Star Trek has been terrrrrrible under Paramount’s watch. Strange New Worlds is all right, mainly due to good casting, but becoming stale. Nepo needs to clean house and start over with a new team. In my dreams, he hires Tony Gilroy… Apple is very generous with the free subscriptions. This year I suddenly got three free months for having a Roku TV, which was not new either so I was confused but happy to take the freebie. Streamers raise prices to whatever the market will bear. They will stop only when it causes churn in excess of the benefit of the price hike. This is true of every other business too. Prices are not set by the cost of goods. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $99 to make, the price is $100. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $1 to make, the price is $100. These streamers might be able to keep viewers attention if they didn’t wait so long between seasons. For example stranger things now has full blown adults on the show when they started out as kids. My attention span moves on if I can’t go back to a show within a reasonable time span without having to refresh my memory. The biggest elephant in the room. Short attention spans, social media and YouTube…. Yup. When everything finally shakes out I dont expect to see more than three to five streamers left standing. Ultimately Peacock can’t survive on its own, and it’s possible Paramount can’t either. Perhaps something happens between those two after Netflix gobbles up Warner Bros. Or perhaps Apple, cautiously biding its time, steps in to acquire whatever legacy leftovers remain. netflix and hulu have always been profitable, though hulu’s margins have been declining since even before disney bought it. none of the other platforms are or have ever been profitable.

Title: ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton predicts 2026 will see the technology get even better and gain the ability to ‘replace many other jobs’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/28/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-2026-prediction-human-worker-replacement/
Time Published: 2025-12-28T20:03:21Z
Full Content:
Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said artificial intelligence technology will continue improving next year, enough to wipe out more human workers. During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, he was asked for his 2026 predictions after declaring 2025 a pivotal year for AI. “I think we’re going to see AI get even better,” Hinton replied. “It’s already extremely good. We’re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It’s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it’s going to be able to replace many other jobs.” He added that AI’s progression is such that after every seven months or so, it is able to complete tasks that took twice as long as before. That means that on a coding project, for example, AI can do in minutes what used to take an hour. And in a few years, AI will be able to perform software engineering tasks that now need a month’s worth of labor. “And then there’ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,” predicted Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI.” Earlier in the interview, he was asked if he was more or less worried about AI since he left Google in 2023 and started warning about the technology’s dangers. “I’m probably more worried,” he answered. “It’s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it’s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.” If an AI believes someone is trying to prevent it from achieving its goals, it will try to deceive people in order to remain in existence and complete its tasks, he explained. To be sure, AI can also benefit humanity by helping researchers make breakthroughs in medicine, education and climate-related innovations. But Hinton said he’s not sure if the risks from AI outweigh the positives. “But along with those wonderful things comes some scary things, and I don’t think people are putting enough work into how we can mitigate those scary things,” he warned. Some AI companies are doing more than others in trying to ensure safety, but Hinton said there’s also a profit motive and tradeoffs that executives are weighing. “They may think there’s a lot of good to be done here, and just for a few lives we’re not going to not do that good,” he said. “For driverless cars, they will kill people, but they’ll kill far fewer people than ordinary drivers.” Hinton has been consistently sounding the alarm on AI, and in recent months has flagged its potential to put humans out of work. In October, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he told Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week. While some studies show AI is improving the productivity of existing workers rather than leading to mass layoffs, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level. A recent analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. Companies like Amazon have announced layoffs while also acknowledging efficiency gains from using AI. And in September, Hinton said AI will create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits, attributing it to the capitalist system. “It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer,” he told the Financial Times

Title: Bitcoin drops 32% as ETF money exits – Yet THIS group isn’t backing off

Bitcoin ETFs record sell-off but hold firm on institutional support. Bitcoin has faced intense selling pressure, with the asset down 32% from its high of $126,000 on the 6th of October. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain a key channel for gauging Bitcoin market sentiment. This time, however, the behavior of investors behind these ETFs suggests deeper dynamics at play. U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have remained on the bearish side of the market, recording significant outflows even as Bitcoin’s price attempts to stabilize. Bitcoin [BTC] Spot ETFs are facing renewed pressure as traditional investors pull back capital while still maintaining exposure to the asset. According to CryptoQuant, Cumulative Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs have reached $5.5 billion from their all-time high. As a result, total Assets Under Management (AUM) have dropped to $116.58 billion, down from a peak of $163.27 billion. Source: CoinGlass This trend confirms that traditional investors, operating through institutional ETFs, have scaled back capital inflows into the market. Such outflows are expected during periods of weak market sentiment, especially as Bitcoin continues to range between $85,000 and $90,000. Despite broader ETF outflows, traditional investors with exposure to BlackRock’s U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF continue to dominate market activity. Over the past twelve days, these investors have purchased more BTC than any other institutional group in the market. Data showed that within this period, the group recorded six separate BTC ETF inflows, with total net inflows amounting to 1.32 million Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.16 billion. This trend remains a key indicator, particularly as BlackRock controls the largest share of BTC among institutional investors. Source: CryptoQuant As of press time, this group held $67.56 billion worth of Bitcoin, reinforcing a bullish undercurrent that continues to influence other ETF participants in the market. Notably, retail investors trading Bitcoin directly through centralized exchanges are also showing signs of renewed confidence. Since the start of December, this group has consistently accumulated BTC week after week. Last week alone, purchases totaled approximately $891.61 billion, according to Glassnode. While this reflects broader global retail investor behavior, it confirms sustained confidence in the asset class, marked by four consecutive weeks of consistent supply absorption. BlackRock may still expand its involvement with Bitcoin, as CEO Larry Fink has publicly shifted his stance on the cryptocurrency. Fink, who previously described Bitcoin as an “index for money laundering” and a tool for “thieves,” had a change in perspective during a recent interview at the DealBook Summit 2025. He noted that BTC now presents a “huge future use case,” signaling growing institutional openness. While the scope of these use cases remains unclear, the shift highlights a potential long-term opportunity for current investors.

Although asset managers had previously fought tooth and nail to offer products tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s spot price, many foresaw opportunities in 2025, as the regulatory environment started to shift with President Donald Trump’s return to power in January. As of Dec. 15, spot Bitcoin ETFs had generated $57.7 billion in net inflows since their historic debut in January 2024, according to Farside Investors. That represented a 59% increase compared to $36.2 billion at the start of this year. But inflows weren’t consistent. Investors poured $1.2 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 6, for example, as the asset approached an all-time high above $126,000, according to CoinGlass. As Bitcoin’s price slipped below the $90,000 mark on Nov. 11, a few weeks later, investors yanked $900 million from the funds. Still, that was only the second worst day for spot Bitcoin ETFs on record: As Bitcoin plunged in February on fears related to trade and inflation, the products posted $1 billion in outflows. Since their debut last July, spot Ethereum ETFs had generated $12.6 billion in net inflows, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. As the cryptocurrency surged toward an all-time high of nearly $4,950 in August, the products generated $1 billion in inflows on a single day. With signs of growing adoption among financial institutions, those products largely operated in the background, as onlookers focused on the prospect of more ETFs that could potentially boost digital asset prices, or expand access to new investors. Yet some are relatively focused on ETFs tracking multiple cryptocurrencies at once, as products ideal for institutions. When the SEC approved generic listing standards for commodity-based trusts in September, the regulator moved to address anticipation that had been building for months. The stack of applications for ETFs covering a wide range of digital assets had grown thick on its desk, with approvals hinging on an answer that the SEC’s previous leadership had danced around for years: When should a digital asset be treated a commodity? Instead of being forced to make case-by-case decisions about the eligibility of various cryptocurrencies, from Dogecoin to the president’s meme coin, the SEC instead outlined criteria for exchanges that made digital assets fit for commodity-based trusts. Among the most important factors, the standards require digital assets underlying ETFs to trade on surveilled markets, have a six-month history of futures trading, or already back an exchange-traded fund with significant exposure. That meant that at least a dozen cryptocurrencies were instantly “good to go,” Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt in September. From his perspective, he described the move as expected. The approval of generic listing standards is set to greatly expand the number of products that investors have access to, but asset managers are still waiting for answers on at least 126 ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Research Analyst James Seyffart recently said on X. Those applications focus on tokens from up-and-coming decentralized finance projects like the Hyperliquid, as well as relatively novel meme coins, including Mog. First there was Bitcoin, then there was Ethereum. Now, investors in the U.S. have access to ETFs tracking the spot price of XRP and Solana, among a handful of others. As the fifth- and seventh-largest digital assets by market capitalization, respectively, XRP and Solana both faced regulatory headwinds under the Biden administration, which dissipated on the road to becoming underlying assets for a number of products. Last year’s debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs unleashed a wave of demand that buoyed the asset’s price to new highs. While the same can’t be said for the smaller cryptocurrencies yet, products dedicated purely to XRP and Solana still generated notable activity. “I don’t think they’ve had the effect on the price that maybe people hoped for, but I do think, idiosyncratically, they have been huge successes and a validation of investor appetite beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. Leon said the debut of ETFs for Solana and XRP came in November at a “disadvantageous time,” with macroeconomic conditions driving digital-asset prices lower in recent months. Still, spot Solana ETFs have generated $92 million in net inflows since launch, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. Spot XRP ETFs, which debuted the same month, have generated roughly $883 million in net inflows since they began trading. The debut of Solana ETFs was notable for another reason: They were among the first ETFs to share a portion of their rewards from staking with investors, a development bolstered by new guidance last month from the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was among financial giants that have thus far passed up the opportunity to expand their set of crypto-focused products to additional assets, but Leon noted that XRP and Solana’s communities may not need them. “What we’ve seen with the ETF so far shows that these communities are much more engaged and stronger and larger than maybe many people thought,” he said. “And I think that bodes well for both ecosystems going into 2026.” Net inflows for spot Dogecoin ETFs stood at $2 million as of Dec. 15, according to SoSoValue. In 2025, individual investors and hedge funds were among the most likely groups to hold spot crypto ETFs, but that dynamic may start shifting materially soon, according to Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management. He told Decrypt that many advisors and professional investors are still in the process of due diligence for ETFs that track cryptocurrencies, but he has a sense that they could start thinking seriously about allocations to the asset class soon. Then again, Vanguard signaled earlier this month that it would let its 50 million customers trade some spot crypto ETFs on its brokerage platform. Bank of America, meanwhile, put its stamp of approval on modest crypto allocations for private wealth clients starting next year. “A year ago or so, there was a lot of regulatory uncertainty, and they weren't really ready to dip their toes into the space” he said. “And now the questions aren’t really whether or not they should get exposure. It's how they should get exposure.” In that sense, O’Shea believes ETFs that track an index of digital assets will become a bigger part of the conversation next year. Many professional investors appreciate how those funds’ holdings shift over time, giving them relative peace of mind, he said. “They can make an allocation to an index ETF and get broad exposure to the growth potential of the market without having to have all that sort of detailed knowledge,” O’Shea explained. “They don't need to know everything about every one of these individual assets.” In February, Hashdex was behind the first spot ETF tracking multiple digital assets in the U.S., with the debut of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. Modeled on the Nasdaq Crypto Index, it holds Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar, as well as larger cryptocurrencies. Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares have debuted similar products, although some seek exposure to digital assets through derivatives. In total, the group of index ETFs offer exposure to 19 digital assets, per ETF Trends. Although some pension funds in the U.S. have purchased spot Bitcoin ETFs, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board liquidated $300 million in holdings around February. The move was revealed via 13F filings that large institutional investors release quarterly. Al Warda Investments disclosed a $500 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in November. The investment firm is tied to the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment, which acts as a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi. Mubadala itself disclosed a position in BlackRock’s product in February, which was worth $567 million, as of its latest 13F filing. Around the same time, it was revealed that Harvard’s endowment held shares in the ETF worth $433 million. Brown University and Emory University also disclosed positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs this year, emerging as early adopters of the asset on an institutional level. Broadly, analysts have said the shift in investors could lead to less volatility for Bitcoin and shallower drawdowns. “It hasn't been dramatic, but it has been notable,” O’Shea said, in reference to a broadening investment base. “This shift from retail to institutional is very good for the long-term sustainability of the asset class, because you do have these folks with much longer-term time horizons.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Worried About Retirement? You're Not Alone: Nearly 50% of Americans in Peak Earning Years Worry About It Every Day

For many Americans, retirement is a constant worry. According to BlackRock, 47% of Americans between the ages of 45 to 54 worry about their retirement savings at least once a day. These financial moves will help to assuage some of those worries. "It’s common for Gen Xers to feel squeezed between saving for retirement and living a meaningful life now. The good news is that they are achieving peak incomes," said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder of Concurrent Wealth. Here's how Gen Xers can move into greater retirement savings and less worry. When it comes to retirement savings, young investors have an advantage because the money they invest has the advantage of growing with compound interest over several decades. Assuming average stock market returns of 6% to 7%, every dollar you invest now can triple or quadruple by the time you retire. People in their 40s and 50s have shorter time horizons, but investing 10 to 20 years out from retirement can still make a difference in their retirement savings. If you aren't already doing so, automate your retirement savings strategy. Put aside money with each paycheck or each month, even if it's only a small amount. These steady payments can help your retirement savings grow, and they can also help to calm some of the panic you may be feeling about retirement. You should also establish an emergency fund. Put three to six months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account, and only reach for it in times of an emergency. This will reduce the temptation to tap your retirement funds for surprise expenses, which can potentially incur hefty penalties. A 401(k) or similar tax-advantaged plan is a great way to build up your retirement savings, especially if it comes with a matching contribution from your employer. As a rule of thumb, investing 10% to 15% of each paycheck is a good goal. In 2025, you can contribute as much as $23,500 in a 401(k). This amount goes up to $70,000 when your contributions are combined with your employer's contributions. If you are in your 50s, you may invest in a catch-up contribution of $7,500 into your 401(k). Individual retirement accounts—like a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA—are other great ways to save for retirement. Both have contribution limits of $7,000 for 2025. Those age 50 older can make a catch-up contribution of $1,000. Cherry encourages Gen Xers to align their financial plans with their values, lifestyle needs, and long-term goals. "This is what I call lifestyle-aligned wealth planning. It’s not just about how much you save, but how intentionally you save," Cherry advises. "When you know your retirement rate—which is how much you need to fund [your retirement] annually—your retirement date, when you want to be work-optional, you’re no longer guessing. You’re designing your life with clarity and confidence." To get started, you'll need to be honest with yourself about the state of your retirement savings and where you would like to be headed. "The keys are being honest, giving yourself grace for where you are, being confident, and committing to where you want to go," Cherry said. For most people, the years between ages 45 and 54 are peak years for income, but many still worry about being able to afford retirement. The best way to beat these worries is through action. Start saving regularly, and contribute as much as you can to tax-advantaged retirement plans, like 401(k)s and IRA accounts. Taking charge of your investments and savings is the best way to ease your concerns about retirement.

Title: Several factors affecting success for job hunters in Lehigh Valley

Time Published: 2025-12-28T12:07:28Z

Sherri Skok wants to work full time. But she is having trouble finding a company that wants her. The 61-year-old Easton resident has a resume with plenty of experience as a personal assistant/chief of staff in corporate offices, including two decades at Barnes & Noble. Apparently, it’s not enough — or it may be too much — for a long list of Lehigh Valley businesses that have advertised openings. Skok has kept a list of them; places where she’s interviewed and was subsequently rejected. Some of them couldn’t be bothered even to send a reply after they talked, which is referred to as “ghosting.” Many others simply didn’t reply to the application, which these days are mostly filled out online. Skok, who has found part-time employment since talking to The Morning Call in early November, said she probably filled out more than a thousand applications, including about 50 since moving to the Lehigh Valley this year. She says she’s received at least one interview for about a quarter of them. “I apply for jobs, and maybe I’m not 100% qualified for or even interested in, just to see where it might lead,” said Skok, who grew up in Macungie and graduated from Emmaus High School and Penn State. “I’ve been aggressive about it. I sometimes spend eight hours a day doing it. I think there has to be an angle [on a job] I’m not considering or maybe I should go about it this way, or let me reach out. There are many, many ways. But it didn’t yield anything.” Her story isn’t unique. Social media has plenty of anecdotes from hard-luck job candidates who have applied to hundreds of them without a bite. Some economists have referred to it as a “jobless boom,” a period of economic growth and high corporate profits that coincides with weak job creation and even layoffs. Michael Rivera, assistant professor of business information systems at Lehigh University, confirmed that Skok has plenty of company. “I think it’s somewhat universal,” he said. Uncertainty about the economy and politics have made some employers reluctant to add workers. “I have spoken to many companies that have funds [to hire, but] that are just hesitant,” Rivera said. “They’re not quite sure where things are going to net out, and it has impacted where they’re looking to make investments.” Additional headwinds for people on the job search are a wave of recent layoffs nationwide with 150,000 workers losing their jobs in October, according to the Associated Press. The cuts are coming from business giants such as Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Target and UPS that are not only dealing with uncertainty over tariffs, but are also looking at ways to implement artificial intelligence in their operations. “We’re reading about strong layoffs proposed for companies that are happening,” Rivera said. “Most recently, I read an article on Walmart’s CEO that says get ready, every single job is going to change and it’s going to have AI in it. Walmart’s plan is for more revenue without increasing its workforce.” The federal government didn’t release labor statistics during the shutdown, but payroll processor ADP reported private sector companies shed 32,000 jobs in November. According to Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, the region’s unemployment rate was at 4.9%, as of September — the most recent statistics available — with job postings up over the year by 18.9% at 15,700. Nationally, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate fell to 3.2% in October, matching the lowest figure since March 2013, not counting the pandemic. After several years at Barnes & Noble — where Skok said she earned “six figures” — she was terminated in 2019 after the company was sold. “At the end of the day, loyalty doesn’t mean anything because when the company got sold, they eliminated my department just like that,” Skok said. Skok had a complicated job search process that wasn’t helped by the COVID pandemic, which put some promising roles on hold. She did find a chief of staff position with a fitness influencer, but left after questions of financial problems. After that was a year with a small equity firm, but she was let go after a major investor dropped out. To keep her finances on track, Skok sold her home in northern New Jersey “to put money in the bank” and took up residence in Easton to continue the job search. Skok said she’s applied to a “who’s who” of local companies and nonprofits since she moved back to the Lehigh Valley. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour. Two months later, the position still was not filled, highlighting her frustration with even finding a lower-wage position. Cathy Rychalsky, who recently took over as executive director at Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, said there is a lot of frustration among job seekers, many of whom never hear back about their applications. She also said some employers are overwhelmed by the number of applications because many are people who apply to jobs not within their skillset to satisfy unemployment requirements. They simply don’t have the staff to review every application and are forced to use things as AI for screening purposes. Another factor is changes in the labor market since the pandemic as employers can be pickier with the applicant pool. “The pendulum has shifted post-pandemic,” Rychalski said. “During the pandemic, people were able to write their job description and how much they wanted to get paid. Today it doesn’t look like that, and it shifted fairly quickly. It has shifted back where the employer is really driving the car.” What to do? Rivera said that even during the search, job seekers should take command of their growth and development. “That is something that is within their span of control. They can guide that,” he said. “They need to be taking an active approach. If they’re taking a passive one, they really run the risk of having other employees outgrow them.” Rivera said earning another college degree isn’t necessary, but he recommended such things as reading, watching videos and attending seminars to improve skills. Writing a resume for the future, which includes skills and competencies you want to have in three to five years, can be a guide. Old strategies, such as networking and making human connections, are still very effective. It’s OK to use AI in the job search to tailor resumes and cover letters to align them with the job description’s keywords, he said. With companies adopting AI, it’s important to show how job seekers are integrating those tools into their skillsets. “I’ve found that the No. 1 thing that companies are looking for today is adaptability,” Rivera said. “At the moment an employee is hired, they need to be growing with market and industry trends, with their corporate culture, always looking to kind of extend their abilities further and further with new tools and new approaches.” Rychalsky suggested using services such as Pennsylvania CareerLink. She said it’s helpful to talk to someone about the ups and downs of the job hunt. “Having someone who’s on the lookout for you, who is connected to the business community, who can maybe even reach out on your behalf and ask if this person did apply, could they reconsider them?” Rychalsky said. “If we don’t have a connection with that business, we might be able to make that connection. That’s what CareerLink is here to do. It’s here to help the job seekers, and is here to help the business community.” Meanwhile, Skok will continue her search for a full-time position that includes benefits. “It’s not like a one-person flight. There are many, many people in the United States who are facing this right now,” she said. “And they’re good qualified candidates. I just don’t understand how the job market became so overly competitive. I asked myself, do these jobs even exist? Is it a way to take your information? Who knows?” Morning Call reporter Evan Jones can be reached at ejones@mcall.com. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour.

Title: John Collison’s bats to D6 topping the property charts: 2025 in quotes and numbers

“My remit was always to lend. During the difficult period, it was like shooting fish in a barrel because not everybody was lending at the time and there was a really great opportunity. There were still really good businesses that needed to borrow.” Avant Money chief executive Niall Corbett as he pressed ahead with plans to turn the nonbank lender into a full Irish bank branch of its Spanish parent Bankinter. “Fashion made statements then. Now, it is just dictated by a couple of brands mostly in Italy and France and we follow on their coat tails, so it is an uneven field – to get recognised you either have to be 18 or a millionaire. Being a boring middle-class father of seven is not the most exciting prospect, which I am happy with, but maybe pride drives me on.” The late Irish fashion designer Paul Costelloe, in an interview with The Irish Times in January, recalls Katherine Hamnett’s famous anti-nuclear T-shirt worn to 10 Downing Street to meet Margaret Thatcher. “We worked out that there could be between five and seven different agencies involved in a data centre. You get over one hurdle, you have to deal with another. You get over this hurdle, you have to go to the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]. You go to EPA, you can’t get a gas connection. That makes it difficult when you have other advanced jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, which has a department of digital infrastructure, or the UK, who are going to treat data as critical infrastructure.” In February, Garry Connolly of industry lobby group Digital Infrastructure Ireland said negativity here around data centres has resulted in multinationals bypassing the State for investment. “When you’re young you’ve nothing to lose. Ignorance is a great thing.” Padraic Rhatigan, who opened the Radisson Red hotel on the outskirts of Galway as one part of a major residential and commercial development, reflected in February on taking over the family business while still in his teens. “Thanks, guys.” Tesla chief executive Elon Musk to shareholders after they voted to approve his $1 trillion (€856 billion) compensation plan in November, awarding the world’s richest person what would be the largest corporate payout in history if he meets the goals necessary to receive it. “Two hundred and twenty eight homes were blocked in Killarney because they would interrupt the commute of a roost of horseshoe bats. Who signed up for this?” In October, Stripe cofounder John Collison looked at how the State can get out of the government-by-agency corner into which it has painted itself. “Within 15 to 25 years, I think it will be mandated that there will be autonomous vehicles. People will not be allowed to drive anything. Public transport systems in the future will become much more efficient. Buses will know what and where the demand is and will organise themselves accordingly.” Also in October, businessman Dermot Desmond called on the Government to scrap the long-awaited MetroLink project and instead plan for wide-scale autonomously-driven bus services. “Looking back, juggling these jobs and being a single parent with teenage kids, I genuinely don’t know how I did it. But I wanted to do it – to be a role model to my girls. Equally, having left school with only a few O-levels, I wanted to add something else to my CV.” BMW Ireland boss Helen Westby in February on working her way through various roles in BMW, looking after her daughters, and completing an MBA. “It’s almost becoming a sort of a two-tier [health service] where you hear clinicians and oncologists certainly talking about it, that they can prescribe a certain medicine to these patients, but the other patients can’t have it.” In an interview with The Irish Times, Samantha Humphreys, who leads pharma group MSD’s Irish business, spoke on how private health insurers have taken to approving payment for certain drugs that have been approved by the European Medicines Agency but are still working their way through the Irish system. “They’re going to hire some pudding whose particular talent will be not upsetting Fingal County Council or the morons in the Department of Transport.” Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary last month expressed faux confidence in airport operator DAA’s recruitment processes after a rift emerged between the board of the State company and its chief executive Kenny Jacobs. At the time of O’Leary’s quote, the two sides had agreed a settlement that would have seen Jacobs leave the business. “I guess a potential Fed chair is here too. I don’t know. Are we allowed to say that? Potential? He’s a respected person – that I can tell you. Thank you, Kevin.” US president Donald Trump keeps nobody guessing as to who he intends to appoint chairman of the Federal Reserve early next year as he introduces top White House economic official Kevin Hassett at an event. “It would be wrong not to confront the fact that we absolutely need gas for this transition. The overseas investors on which our economy depends will move in two or three years without reassurance that energy supplies here are secure.” Bord Gáis Energy chief executive Dave Kirwan last month made the argument that gas remains vital to the State, arguing that it will play a central role in aiding us to end fossil-fuel dependence. “We all know it’s only going one way, the demographics are going to double for over-65s in the next 10 years, over-85s as well. So, there’s a huge demand presently not to think about the future.” [ Bord Gáis Energy’s Dave Kirwan on Irish energy prices and the case for nuclear powerOpens in new window ] In April, Shane Jennings, the former rugby player and now chief executive of Dovida, Ireland’s largest homecare group, gave his take on the State’s preparations for dealing with an ageing population. “He was a nice fellah. He would go to the local pub for a pint in the evening and play some pool with the lads. I got to play a game with him in Fitzgerald’s of Avoca. He was good.” In October, Tesco Ireland boss Geoff Byrne recounted losing a game of pool to actor Colin Farrell while he was shooting the Ballykissangel drama series in Co Wicklow. “I had lunch with 14 European CEOs [at Davos] and the pessimism, you could cut it with a knife. It was so palpable – and it just was so obvious to me that the pessimism was overdone. But the pessimism was loud enough that I think finally the Europeans were waking up and saying, ‘we got to change’.” In April, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said European leaders should lighten up about the outlook for the continent despite a decade and a half of low growth and a perception that business is being over-regulated. [ King of Wall Street says European leaders ‘starting to focus on a growth agenda, not a control agenda’Opens in new window ] “It was hugely special. It couldn’t get any more special than under the lights in Croke Park. It was the first round of the league against the Dubs. To beat them and get front page of many newspapers ... it couldn’t have started any better. It was downhill after that. We didn’t do a whole lot of winning.” Ciaran Marron of Monaghan-based Activ8 Solar Energies spoke in May about the rough and tumble of business after the Monaghan senior football team walked out on to the pitch at Croke Park to play All Ireland champions Dublin wearing jerseys emblazoned with the Activ8 logo. “It’s the most popular Bill ever signed in the history of the country. What we’ve done is put everything into one Bill. We’ve never had anything like that before.” US president Donald Trump in July speaking to the media as his “big, beautiful Bill”, a sweeping spending package, is signed into law during a picnic at the White House. “I was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the family. The older kids were at university and the younger ones were behind me in school. I spent years dealing with the bank trying to pay down debt and get rid of things.” In the summer, serial dealmaker Cathal Friel, the seventh of 10 children, spoke about having to leave school at 16 to run indebted businesses when his father became ill. It left him with a lifelong aversion to debt and property investment. “The importance and benefit of international co-operation has been a key theme of my public life. I will soon be taking up the role of managing director and chief knowledge officer of the World Bank Group, based in Washington DC. I am therefore departing from public life in Ireland.” Then minister for finance Paschal Donohoe resigned his Dáil seat and left ministerial office to take up a role at the World Bank. “They stopped pretending. The mask is off. You’re getting fired if you speak out. Back in the day, [tech employees] used to be even asking questions [of their employer] in the comments on company chat boards.” In June, William Fitzgerald, the Waterford-born founder of The Worker Agency, spoke about the slavishness of tech barons to the Trump administration despite Silicon Valley’s previous outwardly liberal gloss. “I grew up on checkouts from a young age and it’s in my DNA. I grew up in that environment and it teaches you so much about efficiencies, waste and getting value for the customer. I was on the checkout from nine or 10 years of age right up to leaving university.” In September, Robert Ryan, the chief executive of Lidl’s Irish business, explained how he got a taste from retail from an early age while working in the family shop. The median price paid for a home in Dublin 6 in the third quarter, making it the most expensive Eircode in the State, according to property firm Geowox. The district, which includes Rathmines, Ranelagh and Rathgar, recorded the highest median sales price in the State, up 23 per cent year-on-year. The State’s jobless rate in July, hitting that mark for the first time since January 2022, according to revised figures from the Central Statistics Office. The amount paid by Scandinavian property companies Pandox and Eiendomsspar as they agreed to buy Ireland’s largest hotel group Dalata. Dalata, which operates 56 hotels under the four-star Maldron and Clayton brands, mainly in Ireland and Britain, had rejected an initial bid from Pandox and Eiendomsspar in early June that had valued the hotel operator at €1.3 billion. The proposed severance deal for airport operator DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs that was taken off the table after Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien blocked the payment, raising yet more questions about the months-long standoff at the top of the airports group. [ Severance deal of near €1m for DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs off the tableOpens in new window ] O’Brien in November refused to approve the €960,000 payment to Mr Jacobs, which was agreed in September after mediation between the chief executive and the DAA board in talks chaired by industrial relations troubleshooter Kieran Mulvey. The cap on any future tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports imposed by the United States on the European Union. The deal struck by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen with Trump saw European countries head off the US president’s threats of cripplingly high import taxes on products sold across the Atlantic. The number of weeks a bitter High Court civil trial involving three shareholders of tech conference giant Web Summit had been scheduled to last before it was struck out. The case was resolved after talks between the parties concluded with founder Paddy Cosgrave saying he was “delighted” two of his former friends would leave the company. Majority shareholder Cosgrave was suing David Kelly, who owned 12 per cent of the business, for alleged breaches of his fiduciary duties as a director of the company. Mr Cosgrave was, in turn, being sued by Kelly and another shareholder, Daire Hickey, who holds 7 per cent of the shares in Web Summit, for both alleged shareholder oppression and alleged breaches of a profit-sharing agreement. The salary advertised by the Government for its new housing tsar who will be charged with managing the crisis and increasing supply. The role was plunged into controversy when the expected appointee, Brendan McDonagh, the chief executive of the National Asset Management Agency, withdrew from consideration. That came after it emerged Fine Gael had not been consulted on the plan to hire McDonagh, who was expected to keep his existing €430,000 salary. The “colossal” bill the State could soon be facing for missing EU-agreed climate targets, equivalent to a full year of corporate tax receipts or the annual health budget. A report by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Change Advisory Council provided one of the starkest warnings yet of the potential costs involved in failing to adapt to the climate reality. It found that the Republic – on a per capita basis – had the highest emissions target gap of EU member states, meaning it was the least likely to meet its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 51 per cent on the basis of its current trajectory. The drop in the State’s corporate tax receipts in May compared to a year earlier as the exchequer collected €2.5 billion, which was €1.1 billion less that May 2024. Downplaying the decline, the Department of Finance attributed it to “once-off factors” which, it said, boosted receipts last year and distorted the year-on-year comparison. No panic though as €10 billion in corporation tax was received in November, a record for a single month. The top percentile of richest households in the Republic holding almost half the wealth, according to Central Bank of Ireland data. The total net wealth of households here rose to a record €1.25 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, up €6.3 billion on the previous quarter. The figures showed that the wealthiest 10 per cent of households held €645 billion or 48.6 per cent of the total. This was five times the wealth held by the bottom 50 per cent of households, which stood at €117.8 billion or 8.9 per cent of the national total. [ One in 10 Irish households have net wealth of more than €1mOpens in new window ] The insurance industry’s final bill for Storm Éowyn, which struck Ireland in January, making it the most expensive insurance event in Irish history. The storm was one of the most damaging Ireland has ever faced, bringing gusts of 184km/h, breaking a record that had stood since 1945. Some 815,000 properties on the island lost power, with 768,000 of these in the Republic. Many were without power for weeks, while hundreds of energy technicians were drafted in from abroad to help ESB Networks with repairs. A breakdown of the final toll from the event released to The Irish Times shows a total of 33,768 claims were lodged. The estimated worth of a payment halted by State-owned energy company Bord na Móna for its chief executive after officials said continuing the “unsanctioned” earnings risked undermining public pay policy. The payment, which covered benefit-in-kind taxes on Tom Donnellan’s health insurance and company car, has been dropped from a new contract signed by the chief executive in April, the company confirmed. The value of PTSB after it put itself up for sale. The 57 per cent State-owned bank surprised the stock market by the move, which sent its market value up 23.4 per cent in Dublin. [ Paschal Donohoe must use PTSB sale to find owner with vision – not just a red penOpens in new window ] A deal would mark the return of all three domestic banks that survived the 2008 financial crisis to private ownership – and complete the recovery of the €29.4 billion in total that was injected into them. PTSB, by far the smallest of the three, has been dogged by low profit returns since the crash. This is largely due to its small scale – even after increasing its balance sheet by about 50 per cent between 2022 and 2023 after acquiring €6.8 billion of Ulster Bank loans. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Should we ban social media for under-16s? Irish teens share their thoughts

Earlier this month Australia became the first country in the world to ban social media for children under the age of 16. It’s a move that’s being watched closely around the globe, not least by those aged under 16, wondering if this could become their reality too. Here, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said “there needs to be more debate on whether blanket bans are the way to go”, while Tánaiste Simon Harris said he is “very supportive of the idea of social media being restricted to people above a certain age”. But what do those likely to be affected if a similar ban was to happen in Ireland think? Sarah Davitt (15), from Blackrock, Co Dublin, recently returned from a trip to Brussels with the Webwise Youth Panel, which is focused on raising awareness of online safety. “I personally would be against it [the ban] being brought in to Ireland,” she says. “By banning something outright, less education is going to be put forward. If we’re trying to educate our youth on social media, we cannot do that unless we have the use of social media.” She says “restrictions and safety by design” are more appropriate. If a ban was to happen, however, she feels it should be geared towards 12- and 13-year-olds. She believes a ban will make social media “more attractive”. “Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out. “I don’t think people realise how easy it is to work a VPN,” Sarah says, referring to a virtual private network. “Changing the country’s location is so phenomenally easy ... I’ve seen my friends do it when their parents are really strict on social media ... Most people my age, even if they’re allowed or not allowed social media by their parents, have accounts.” She says there needs to be more education and “digital media literacy”. Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out “If we bring in this ban we’re just going to presume kids aren’t on social media, because they shouldn’t be there, which then just creates a worse social media space ... Without having social media companies held accountable for keeping online safe for kids, it’s not going to be created safe for anyone else.” She points also to the opportunities social media creates for people who are part of minority groups to connect. “Most people have seen harmful videos on the internet. I think most of my friends and I saw the video of when Charlie Kirk was shot ... Obviously the trad wife trend, that has been very prevalent on social media recently. I understand that the Government is trying to help us and trying to protect us. And I do agree that something has to be done, and done soon ... banning it at 16 is just not the solution.” Zach Moore (14), from Greenhills, Dublin, uses WhatsApp, Snapchat and YouTube mostly. Social media is important to him. He too is part of the Webwise Youth Panel. That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped “If I’m bored, I’d probably go on social media. If I needed to know something, I’d look it up. And I talk to my friends as well,” Zach says. If he comes across misogynistic, racist or other unacceptable content he says he ignores it or reports it. “That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped. He seems like a bit of an extremist,” Zach says. He can see how this material can target boys. “I can definitely why they’d want to ban it, but to be honest I don’t think a complete ban would solve anything ... I think they would have been better to have mandatory parental controls. Leave it up to the parents.” Zach worries he spends too much time on social media sometimes. But he thinks if a ban was introduced in Ireland young people might spend more time trying to get around the ban rather than doing other things. He thinks some adults understand how important social media is to young people. “But some think that it’s all bad,” he says. “I don’t think that it’s all bad, but there definitely are certain areas that are malicious, or there’s no good intent.” [ Could Ireland follow Australia and ban under-16s from social media?Opens in new window ] He’d like to see “stricter moderation on platforms” and more education and support provided to teenagers on how to navigate problematic content that they might come across. He thinks the youth voice is important. “It’s definitely good to hear from people who are going to be directly affected, or people who are at risk of coming under the ban.” He expects adults and younger people may hold polar opposite views. Zach doesn’t think adults necessarily know best on this. “Especially with social media because it’s only really gained this much traction over the past 15 years.” Eve Cullen, from Tipperary, is 15. She uses TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it She feels “in theory it’s a good idea to stop letting kids use social media” but argues that a cut-off age of 16 is too high. “Eleven or 12 would be perfect.” At 15, she says, “a lot of our lives revolve around social media and it’s important to have”. She believes people will easily find a way around any ban. “I feel like a lot of the people who brought in this ban might not have kids themselves. Parents might know more about how kids are going to get around it.” Many young people find their “community” online, Eve says. She uses Snapchat to call and text people she already knows. “It’s great to meet new people on TikTok.” Eve says most young people have their wits about them when it comes to the danger of being contacted by strangers who may not be who they claim to be. “I don’t think it’s as big a problem as a lot of people make it out to be.” Eve has seen some upsetting content online. “I figure a way to go around it and ignore it. It’s not a huge thing online for me.” She insists she’s not hugely influenced by political, health or wellness content she sees online, saying she’s more likely to try out a recipe. She believes there are lots of positives to social media. “I love doing knitting and crochet and stuff like that. And there’s not many people in Thurles, where I live, that would be into that as well. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it. But if social media was banned then I’d be very lonely in that hobby.” At school, Eve uses Instagram for her transition year (TY) mini-company. “Everyone in TY in our school [uses Instagram] to promote and advertise our products,” she explains. Her social media “used to be controlled when I was younger. There was an app on my phone that would block screen time,” Eve explains. But she feels at this age she is able to “self-police”. She worries that if teenagers weren’t granted access to social media until the age of 16, they wouldn’t know what things they “should look out for. They might get scammed, even, because they’ve never been exposed to it,” she says. Holly Heneghan (16) lives in Westmeath. She says she would hate a ban. “With Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, the main three for me, it’s entertainment. Snapchat is for communicating with my friends ... I call and text on Snapchat.” She has seen things on social media that she doesn’t feel are appropriate for 12- and 13-year-olds to see, but feels things have improved. “There is still a lot of body positive stuff on social media now. [More] than there was when I was 12.” She has come across problematic material but “not necessarily in the apps that have been banned”. Inappropriate material can show up in advertisements that crop up in games, she explains. “There are times I’ve spent too much time on social media,” Holly admits, “but I go on social media because it shows me things I’m interested in. It gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like.” She doesn’t believe teens will accept the ban. “I think they’ll try and figure out a way to keep their social media.” Holly thinks a ban would make those under 16 more secretive about their social media use. She feels adults don’t necessarily understand the huge support social media can offer, including academically. “On TikTok there is a Stem site. It can teach you maths, science and engineering.” She believes the positives of social media outweigh the negatives. [Social media] gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like Hannah Goff (16) from Dublin, thinks a social media ban “is a really good idea” for younger people, but feels 14 or 15 may be a more appropriate cut-off age. “I don’t think people under 16 actually need phones to function.” She thinks younger teens could organise meet-ups through parents. “I think it might be easier as well for parents to understand where their child is and what their child might be doing.” She feels not having a phone could lead to under-16s meeting up with their friends in person more frequently. “However, I do think in Ireland there’s a lack of things to do for people under 16.” Hannah has learned a lot about content awareness in school. “If you know how to use social media, you’re better off with it, but I think people a lot of the time were just handing their kids phones ... and then they’re not really prepared for what they come across. [ A grand social media experiment begins in Australia. Will it work?Opens in new window ] “During the elections in the US I did see a lot of propaganda for Trump and Kamala. But I would just scroll past that. I don’t think I’ve seen anything that has been particularly disturbing or upsetting. But also I’ve been very careful to avoid that.” “You do see a lot of people online who are very different to how they normally look. They’re edited.” She feels younger people could be vulnerable to this. “I’ve seen a lot of eight- to 10-year-olds now who are using all the internet make-up”. Hannah believes the under-16s “will definitely” try to get around any ban “considering when the Yondr pouch was brought in. Everyone’s gotten around it at this point. “Teenagers, you tell them something to do and they will do the opposite. You give them a barrier and they’re going to go under it, over it, through it,” she says. Dr Colman Noctor, child and adolescent psychotherapist, says delaying access until a young person is mature enough “is the right thing to do”. But, he adds, “the how you do that is more complex”. He feels the Australian strategy, “while well intended, may not work”. “Imposing bans will always meet resistance and so some form of alliance with young people is far more likely to be successful. However, the difficulty is that young people think adults don’t have a clue about social media, and adults don’t think young people have a clue about real life. And both are probably true, but meeting a consensus will take time. “While I’m not sure the ban is the answer, waiting around for another 15 years to gain consensus is not a workable solution either,” Noctor says. “The damage of social media is happening now. “For me the only way this will be resolved is if the social media companies take the lead and invest in meaningfully protecting children, but that does not fit with their financial models so we have to do what we can in the meantime.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ukrainian negotiations drag on, by Thierry Meyssan
URL: https://www.voltairenet.org/article223442.html

Peace negotiations in Ukraine are hampered by the Zelensky administration’s resistance. The administration is attempting to buy time, first through legal means, then through military means, and finally through political means. However, the contacts made suggest what this peace will look like. This article follows: 1 - “Straussians take control of the United Nations and NATO,” October 7, 2025. 2 - “Anti-Russian propaganda and preparations for war against Russia,” October 28, 2025. 3 - “The moment of truth: The West faces Russian military advances,” November 4, 2025. 4 - “The fall of the Zelensky regime and its allies,” November 25, 2025. 5 - “What lies behind the peace negotiations for Ukraine?” December 2, 2025. Peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are dragging on. Clearly, the Russian side, confident of victory, intends to liberate what remains of the Donbas as soon as possible, while the Ukrainian side refuses to concede anything. The Europeans of the EU and the UK are holding numerous meetings, almost one a day, with the sole obsession of continuing the war, with or without the United States. Two new events have changed the situation: Washington is considering leaving NATO, and the Ukrainians are accepting the idea of selling their country. On December 1st, a secret videoconference was held with the participation of: the French (Emmanuel Macron) and Finnish (Alexander Stubb) presidents, the German Chancellor (Friedrich Merz), the Polish (Donald Tusk), Italian (Giorgia Meloni), Danish (Mette Frederiksen), and Norwegian (Jonas Gahr Støre) prime ministers, the NATO Secretary General (Mark Rutte), the President of the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen), and the President of the European Council (António Costa). According to Der Spiegel, which obtained a copy of the meeting’s minutes, the NATO Secretary General stated that he agreed with the Finnish president and that Europeans should be wary of the peace talks in Ukraine being negotiated by President Donald Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. [1] This is the first time a sitting NATO Secretary General has dared to openly criticize a sitting US President. The National Security Strategy, published on December 4 by the White House, mentions NATO five times. However, it is no longer a crucial alliance for the United States, given that President Trump has declared the end of the "American Empire." Washington is too preoccupied with its $33 trillion debt to dedicate itself to the defense of Western Europe. The document therefore merely notes that the member states of the Atlantic Alliance will have to ensure their own security by allocating 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), a far cry from their current spending. It also notes that the alliance is not expected to expand further [2]. On December 9, five days later, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie (Kentucky), introduced a bill (HR 6508) aimed at withdrawing the United States from NATO. This bill was referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee on December 12 [3]. This is the first time this subject will be addressed in Congress. It is too early to draw any conclusions, but we must already acknowledge that there is a current within the Trump administration opposed to the Atlantic alliance, and that European states are aware that they will not be able to simultaneously ensure their own national defense and attack the Russian Federation. Privately, President Trump’s associates maintain that he will withdraw from the alliance by mid-2027; a deadline that could be brought forward. The leaders of the European Union are well aware of this. The President of the European Council, António Costa, declared on December 8th before the Jacques Delors Institute: “If we want to protect ourselves, not only against our adversaries, but also against allies who challenge us, we must strengthen Europe. We need to work together to build a Europe that understands that the relationships between allies and the alliances formed after the Second World War have changed.” Certainly, but EU members simply don’t have the resources of the United States. They cannot ensure their own defense alone. Moreover, if they wished to, they would have to organize themselves around one of the three nuclear powers in their region: France, the United Kingdom, or… Russia. A month ago, on November 11, Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, gave the signal for “Operation Midas.” The main allies of the unelected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, fell, one by one. It is inconceivable that he is not one of the main beneficiaries of the embezzlement of funds from Ukraine and the extortion of Ukrainian businesses. Yet no one dares to arrest him. Clearly, he is trying to cling to power to secure his gains or transfer them abroad. He first rallied Ukraine’s supporters, holding numerous meetings in Athens, Paris, London, Brussels, Rome, and Berlin, while his special representative and the secretary general of his Defense Council, Rustem Umerov, was already in hiding. Power in Ukraine is therefore now a shadowy affair: the unelected president could fall at any moment, and his chief negotiator can no longer return to his homeland. In an interview with Politico on December 9 [4], President Trump made the following statement: — Dasha Burns: Is it time for Ukraine to hold an election, do you think? — Donald Trump: Yes. I think so. It’s been a long time. It’s, uh... it hasn’t gone particularly well. Yes, I believe it’s time. I think it’s an important moment to hold elections. They’re using the war not to hold an election, but, uh, I think the Ukrainian people should... should have that choice. And maybe Zelenskyy would win. I don’t know who would win. But they haven’t had an election in a long time. You know, they talk about a democracy, but it’s getting to the point where it’s no longer a democracy. The unelected president immediately replied: "I am ready for elections. I am now asking, I am stating this openly, the United States to help me, possibly with European colleagues, to ensure security for holding elections." It is important to know that the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits elections during periods of martial law. Martial law was first imposed in 2018 by President Petro Poroshenko during the presidential election campaign [5]. Then, a second time, in 2022, by President Volodymyr Zelensky during the Russian special military operation. Martial law institutes nine measures: • Restrictions on the constitutional rights and freedoms of civilians; • Introduction of a "work obligation," applicable to everyone, whether employed or not, and which may include service in the military; • Seizure of state-owned property, or "forcibly disposing of" communal and private property "for the needs of the state"; • Introduction of a curfew; • Introduction of military checkpoints and restrictions on "the freedom of movement of citizens, foreigners, and stateless persons, as well as the movement of vehicles"; • Verification of individuals’ documents and inspection of their locations; • Prohibition of peaceful demonstrations, gatherings, and mass events; • Prohibition or restrictions on the media; • Prohibition or restrictions on the transfer of information on social media. In both cases, the aim was clearly to establish an authoritarian regime. While Poroshenko only implemented it for thirty days, Zelensky has renewed it every three months since February 2022. According to the sixteenth presidential decree on the matter that he promulgated, it is extended until next February. According to the Constitution, Volodymyr Zelensky’s term expired in May 2025. Since then, the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Ruslan Stefanchuk, should have been serving as interim president. Not only did he not request this position, but he accompanied the outgoing president on his initial trips to assert his legitimacy. If elections were held today, the electoral lists would be falsified, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed in action are still listed. Under these circumstances, it would be child’s play for the regime to rig the ballot boxes. The Russian side has repeatedly emphasized that it cannot sign a peace agreement with an illegitimate figure. It recalls that President Poroshenko declared the Minsk agreements, signed by his special envoy and predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, null and void overnight because this high-ranking official had not been validated by him or by the Verkhovna Rada. The announcement by the now unelected Ukrainian president that he would agree to hold elections is therefore likely just a way to buy time and further postpone peace. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) estimated the value of Ukraine’s rare earth elements at between $10 trillion and $12 trillion during a June 9, 2024 interview on "Face the Nation" (CBS News). President Trump had mentioned the possibility of transferring them to the United States a few months earlier to repay what the war cost them. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traveled to Kyiv on February 12 to discuss the matter with President Zelensky. So, on December 10, the unelected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, convened a videoconference with Scott Bessent, Jared Kushner (not as a negotiator in Moscow, but as head of the Affinity Partners fund), and Larry Fink (head of the BlackRock fund and already owner of a large portion of the farmland) [6]. The purpose was clearly to assess what could be purchased in exchange for the rare earths. What was unthinkable ten months ago had suddenly become possible. A second meeting was held the following day, December 11. Zelensky brought together the main US negotiators and invited the NATO Secretary General. The aim was to review security guarantees, given that NATO is no longer a permanent entity.

Title: Just 1–2% – Here’s how retirement funds can change crypto forever

Time Published: 2025-12-27T20:00:05Z

Even tiny allocations force exchanges and funds to adopt stronger practices. Retirement funds are built to be boring. That isn’t a flaw, it’s the point. They move as slowly as their beneficiaries, avoid surprises, and make the future feel manageable. On the other hand, crypto was built for the exact opposite. Because of this, it is often seen as too immature for pension money. This framing assumes that stability comes before participation. But, what if it works the other way around? Pension funds manage calendars, rather than money in the abstract. Salaries stop, pensions don’t. Assets that can drop in the double-digits as fast as you can say “crypto!” are difficult to square with that responsibility. Bitcoin, for all its growing legitimacy, still moves too much. In 2025 alone, it slid from near $120k to around $80k. This is a decline large enough to be called a “cycle” in crypto terms. However, this is a big problem in pension math. Crypto maxis know that this isn’t an outlier. Similar drops have been seen in the past too. Source: TradingView Price, though, is only part of the discomfort. Regulation remains uneven and often political, changing with court rulings and administrations. Custody has improved, but the industry hasn’t yet forgotten its own history. Exchange failures, frozen withdrawals, and creative accounting are still fresh in the mind, and even the rulebook is still being written. And then, there’s fiduciary duty. Pension managers are paid to avoid permanent loss, rather than explain it. By that measure, crypto still fails various tests. History has a way of taming assets that begin as inconvenient, volatile, and deeply unserious. This usually happens once large pools of patient capital decide it’s time to stop watching. Equities were the first. In the early 1900s, stock markets were thin, chaotic, and lightly regulated. Then, supervision changed everything. Pensions, insurers, and mutual funds arrived with scale, long time horizons, and a no-nonsense attitude. Disclosure standards followed. Audits became normal. The markets, eventually, behaved. When asked about the possibilities for crypto, Neil Staunton, CEO and co-founder of Superset told AMBCrypto, “Stablecoins, MMFs, RWAs, and the general tokenization of assets will bring institutional risk management into crypto markets.” However, he noted that it is not without its kinks. “The real risk is the absence of institutional standards. BlackRock was among the first to fully understand that risk.” Staunton noted that once BlackRock could change the risk profile, it had “the confidence to create an institutional product.” With this, the institution helped exchanges stop manipulation, making the asset reflect the true market. “Having mitigated those risks, they sold a product that became the fastest-growing ETF in history. Institutional best practices, once adopted, mature the market.” The CFA Institute has since put numbers to the pattern. Higher institutional ownership tends to bring better governance and greater stability over time. As it turns out, order in finance is… well, contagious. Property had its own makeover. Before institutional capital, real estate investing was local, illiquid, and occasionally opaque. Then came REITs (now a roughly $2 trillion global market) designed to translate bricks and rent into something we could actually live with. Municipal bonds followed a similar path as well. The capital arrived before the credibility. Crypto, for better or worse, may just be earlier in that same cycle. There is a particular kind of money that has no interest in being right quickly. Pension money arrives with time, and time has a way of changing rooms. Money that isn’t rushed makes markets quieter. Leverage looks less clever. What’s left is the work. The liquidity changes as well. Pension balance sheets aren’t dependent on cheap funding that vanishes under stress. They move slowly, if at all. With crypto, the instability will always remain but the extremes become less sharp. Even when pensions participate, they would do so carefully. Even a 1-2% crypto allocation would be diversified across assets, strategies, and risk buckets. That spreads exposure and reduces the maddening effects of the violent inflow-outflow cycles. And then, there are expectations. Audits. Custody. Risk frameworks. Habits carried over from more mature markets. Over time, those habits become standards, and the standards rearrange incentives. …and crypto is starting to see that now. Through infrastructure and scale. Source: downing.house.gov In the United States, this becomes clear if you look at ETFs and retirement frameworks. Since President Trump’s re-election, Washington has moved towards a more permissive stance on digital assets. This includes an executive order aimed at better access to crypto and other alternatives inside retirement plans. Source: SoSoValue The result has been a surge in regulated exposure. Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ETFs have pulled in roughly $30 billion in net inflows YTD at the time of writing, led by products like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Source: SoSoValue Remember, none of these are fringe instruments. This matters because ETFs drag regulation with them. Court rulings, SEC approvals, custody rules, disclosure standards… none of these arrived because crypto asked nicely. Industry groups have been explicit too. Demand is strong, and the regulatory environment is adapting to meet it. Once pension systems, sovereign funds, and retirement plans engage (even cautiously), crypto becomes too systemically relevant to remain vague. For many pension systems, especially underfunded ones, instability is an existential concern. In the U.S, large public pension plans are 86.3% funded as of November 2025, per data from Milliman. This is a sign of sustained improvement; stronger balance sheets, but not unlimited risk tolerance. Source: Milliman Funds in that position simply do not have the luxury of absorbing big losses, no matter how compelling the long-term story is. Political risk hasn’t vanished either. Crypto regulations remain uneven across jurisdictions and borders, vulnerable to election cycles, court challenges, and sudden policy reversals. Even within the same country, there could be conflict. A more crypto-friendly posture at the higher level doesn’t automatically translate into support at the state or municipal level. Case in point – Key stakeholders continue to oppose New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his skepticism of crypto. His non-acceptance comes even with U.S policy growing more supportive after President Trump’s re-election. Then, there are the unresolved weaknesses. Fraud has not disappeared. Governance failures still surface. Custody infrastructure, while improving, is not foolproof. Even regulators acknowledge that oversight standards across exchanges and intermediaries remain inconsistent. So, no. This is not an argument that crypto is suddenly prudent. It is still risky. The difference is that it is no longer uniquely risky. Global pensions and retirement assets now run into the tens of trillions of dollars, spread across public funds, private plans, and sovereign systems. Against that backdrop, a 1-2% allocation to crypto is a rounding decision. And yet, even that small slice would matter, because that would change who the market is built for. Long-term retirement capital needs structure and rules that last. When it shows up, markets adjust. So, the real question is not whether pensions should take the leap with crypto. It is whether crypto ever truly grows up without them. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: America's affordability crisis is putting Aldi in the spotlight

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Newlyweds Brittany Zwier and Frank Martinez are starting their life together looking for ways to save money. Zwier, 32, and Martinez, 40, have an annual income of more than $100,000 — but are finding their dollars aren’t stretching as far as they used to. The couple now buys groceries exclusively at the no-frills supermarket chain Aldi, where they say the prices are cheaper than at other stores. “We’re just buying what we need right now,” Zwier said outside an Aldi in New Jersey. They have stopped buying beef, which hit record-high prices this year as climate and import issues limited cattle supply. Zwier and Martinez are not alone. For millions of Americans, the cost of living has risen sharply in recent years, fueled by a mix of persistent inflation, high interest rates, soaring energy costs and consumer price increases due to tariffs. More than half of respondents in a recent NBC News poll said they have changed the groceries they buy in order to stay within their budgets. In the same survey, the cost of housing and the cost of food ranked as the top two economic problems respondents said their families were facing. This affordability crisis continues despite recent signs pointing to a resilient economy. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones stock indexes both closed at record highs on Christmas Eve. And newly released data showed that GDP grew 4.3% in the third quarter of the year, much more than economists had been expecting. The spoils of a booming stock market are not being distributed evenly. Economists say consumers are separating into two distinct tiers — what they’re calling a K-shaped economy. “The K-shape economy means that some Americans, usually the wealthiest Americans, are doing just fine,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “They’re in the top of the K. Their incomes are rising. Their spending is rising.” But many on the lower end of the “K” are finding their paychecks can’t keep up with rising costs of food, housing, utilities and child care. “They feel like they’re falling behind, or, if on a good day, maybe treading water,” Long said. To keep their expenses in check, Zwier and Martinez have cut back on eating out. “Maybe once every three months now, we’ll go out,” said Martinez. “Used to be at least date night here and there. But that’s something we’re now sacrificing because everything is just too expensive.” Zwier and Martinez are part of a broader pullback in restaurant spending — one that is taking a bite out of fast-casual spots like Chipotle, Cava and Sweetgreen. “A lot of the chain restaurants have had a hard time in this environment where people don’t want to pay $15 to $20 for a burrito or a salad,” said Long. The K-shaped shift has also drawn the attention of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “We’re seeing people tightening their belts, changing products that they buy, buying less,” Powell said at a recent press conference in Washington. And the price pinch many consumers are experiencing this year goes beyond food. Zwier and Martinez have seen their electric and gas bills skyrocket. “We’re using less, and it costs more,” Zwier said. Across the country, electricity costs have jumped 6.9% in the last year, more than twice the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This winter, U.S. households could spend an average of $995 on home heating alone, an increase of $84 from 2024, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “These increases may not sound dramatic to higher-income households,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. “But for families already struggling, they are devastating.” Budget retailers and grocers like Costco, Walmart and Aldi are well positioned to benefit from shifting spending habits among higher- and middle-income consumers. “We’re seeing shoppers across all demographics and income levels turning to Aldi, because the simple truth is that no one wants to pay more for groceries than they have to,” an Aldi spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. Aldi has seen explosive growth over the last decade. The grocer said it operated 1,230 U.S. stores in 2012. That number had nearly doubled to around 2,400 U.S. stores in 2023. And Aldi plans to expand further with 800 new stores nationwide by 2028. The discount supermarket chain has gained a reputation for low prices and a bare-bones approach. Coin-operated shopping carts, few name-brand products and items shelved in cardboard containers and crates are all part of the Aldi experience. The promise of low prices draws shoppers like Michael Torres, who said he has been coming to Aldi for the last couple years. Torres and his wife, who have a 1-month-old daughter, are finding ways to make ends meet on an income of less than $50,000 a year. “As much as you can save is important,” Torres said outside a New Jersey Aldi earlier this month. “You still want to make sure you have the fridge full, whatever you need on the table.” “There’s wants and there’s needs,” he added. “If you need something, you get it.” But for now, he said, some “wants” may have to wait. As many Americans pull back on spending, the U.S. economy has become increasingly dependent on high-income households. The top 10% of earners were responsible for a record 49.2% of total U.S. consumer spending in the second quarter of this year, according to Moody’s Analytics. Many businesses are seeing strong demand for their premium fare. Ford and General Motors recently reported soaring sales for their biggest and priciest SUVs. Some companies are also building out their higher-end offerings to draw in big spenders. This month, American Airlines debuted a splashy new plane with lie-flat seats and Bluetooth connectivity while budget carrier JetBlue just opened its first airport lounge. But economists warn that relying on a tiny slice of Americans to drive consumer spending could put the U.S. on shaky footing. Consumer spending makes up the lion’s share of the nation’s total economic activity. “Whether the economy goes into a recession in 2026 hinges almost entirely on the top 20%,” said Navy Federal Credit Union’s Long. “If they do well, the overall economy does well. If they don’t, then we’re looking at a recession.” In the meantime, she said, everyone else could face growing pressure. “Wage gains are going to keep getting smaller, and inflation, those basic costs, are going to keep ticking up,” Long said. “That’s a recipe for middle-class squeeze.” Kayla Steinberg is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Russia Launches Drone Barrage on Kyiv Ahead of Zelenskyy-Trump Meeting

Rescue workers extinguish a fire in a high-rise residential building in the Dniprovskyi district damaged by a Russian drone strike on December 27, 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine. The attacks came as Trump and Zelenskyy are expected to discuss critical questions in a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, including its territorial sovereignty, NATO protections, and control over its natural resources. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his way to Florida for a pivotal set of talks this weekend with US President Donald Trump, Russia launched a barrage of drone and missile attacks on Kyiv early Saturday morning. At least two people were killed in the Ukrainian capital during the 10-hour attack, with 44 more—including two children—injured. Hundreds of thousands of residents are left to brave near-freezing temperatures without heat following the attack, which cut off power supplies. The attack came as Zelenskyy prepared to stop in Canada before meeting with Trump on Sunday to discuss a 20-point plan to end the nearly four-year war with Russia that has been the subject of weeks of negotiation between US and Ukrainian emissaries. Zelenskyy is seeking to maintain Ukraine's territorial sovereignty without having to surrender territory—namely, the eastern Donbass region that is largely occupied by Russian forces. He also hopes that any agreement to end the war will come with a long-term security guarantee reminiscent of NATO. On Friday, Zelenskyy told reporters that the peace deal was 90% complete. But Trump retorted that Zelenskyy "doesn't have anything until I approve it." Trump has expressed hostility toward Zelenskyy throughout his presidency. In February, before berating him in a now-infamous Oval Office meeting, Trump insisted falsely that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for starting the war in 2022. Zelenskyy's latest peace proposal was issued in response to Trump's proposal last month, which was heavily weighted in Russia's favor. It called for Ukraine to recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and cede the entirety of the Donbass, about 2,500 square miles of territory, to Russia, including territory not yet captured. Trump's plan puts a cap of 600,000 personnel on Ukraine's military and calls for Ukraine to add a measure in its constitution banning it from ever joining NATO. Earlier this year, Trump demanded that Ukraine give up $500 billion worth of its mineral wealth in what he said was "repayment" for US military support during the war (even though that support has only totalled about $175 billion). In his latest proposal, Trump has pared down his demands to the creation of a "Ukraine Development Fund" that would include the "extraction of minerals and natural resources" as part of a joint US-Ukraine reconstruction effort. While those terms appear less exploitative, the reconstruction program is expected to be financed by US loans from firms like BlackRock, which have been heavily involved in the diplomatic process. "The infrastructure rebuilt with these loans—ports, rail lines, power grid—won’t be Ukrainian in any meaningful sense. It’ll be owned by international consortiums, operated for profit, with revenues flowing out to service the debt," wrote the Irish geopolitical commentator Deaglan O'Mulrooney on Tuesday. "In other words, Ukraine will be gutted." Despite the criticism, Zelenskyy has signaled support in principle for the US reconstruction proposal as an alternative to direct expropriation. The "red lines" for Zelenskyy heading into his talk with Trump are related to Ukraine's territorial integrity. He has said he will not recognize Russian control of the Donbass, or the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, which Russia currently controls. He has also demanded that all terms of a peace agreement come up for a referendum among the Ukrainian people, which is strongly against territorial concessions. At the same time, however, he insisted Saturday that "Ukraine is willing to do whatever it takes to stop this war."

Title: Kelley Blue Book Says These 5 SUVs Are Some Of The Best Cars You Can Buy

Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver. As a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below. Rated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring. Yet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are "underwhelming," while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year. In terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value. Kelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon. But where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years. With a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes. The winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features. In terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs. The '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions. On the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value. Large enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes. Edmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025). But if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.

Title: Big Bet On Ethereum: CEO Sees 10X TVL Growth In 2026

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom, Ethereum could see a major jump in total value locked (TVL) next year if certain onchain trends pick up. Chalom put a bold number on it: 10X TVL in 2026. That claim ties together rising stablecoin use, bigger tokenization of real-world assets, and increased interest from big financial groups. Based on reports, the total stablecoin market stands at about $308 billion now and could grow to $500 billion by the end of next year, a rise of roughly 62%. Over half of all stablecoin activity — about 54% — happens on Ethereum. That math matters: more stablecoin flows on Ethereum tends to lift the protocol’s TVL because many of those dollars sit in smart contracts for swaps, lending, and liquidity pools. Sharplink Gaming holds 797,704 Ether, worth roughly $2.30 billion at the time of publication, a signal that some public treasuries are already staking big bets on the network. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets to expand rapidly, forecasting a $300 billion market for RWAs in 2026 and saying tokenized assets will 10X in AUM next year as funds, stocks, and bonds get wrapped onchain. In 2026, I believe Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) will increase 10X. Why and how? 🧵 Views ≠ investment advice. — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) December 26, 2025 He points to rising interest from mainstream firms like JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock. Reports note that sovereign wealth funds may increase their Ethereum exposure by five- to tenfold, which could bring large, patient capital into tokenization projects and protocol deposits. Ethereum was trading near $2,921 on December 25, 2025, giving the network a market value of about $352 billion, while 24-hour trading volume came in at roughly $11.47 billion. Over the course of 2025, ETH moved through a full market swing. It opened the year around $3,298, climbed to about $4,390 in August, and stayed below its record high of $4,942, before sliding back to the $2,921 area by year-end. Price swings were heavy, with annual volatility close to 140%. Technical readings show mixed momentum. The weekly RSI sits at 41.7, placing Ethereum in a neutral-to-bearish zone, while the daily MACD histogram remains negative at -0.15. Price action has also been boxed into a narrow band between $2,774 and $3,038. Futures data adds to the cautious tone. Total open interest stands near $37 billion, down 0.62% over the past 24 hours, pointing to reduced exposure from traders. Liquidation data shows more than $100 million in potential long liquidations clustered between $2,880 and $2,910, an area now seen as a key pressure point. Not everyone agrees that token flows will translate into quick price gains. According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Ether is unlikely to hit new highs next year given current Bitcoin conditions. That caution lines up with technicals that point to range-bound trading and with the fact that open interest has eased slightly. The liquidation cluster near $2,880–$2,910 shows where leveraged positions could be forced out, and that kind of stress can push price moves faster than fundamentals.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Nvidia Just Paid $20B for a Company That Missed Its Revenue Target by 75%

Time Published: 2025-12-27T16:47:13Z
Full Content:
If you’ve heard “Grok” thrown around lately, you’re probably thinking of Elon’s chatbot from xAI. We’re not talking about that one. That model isn’t particularly good, but its whole value prop is being politically incorrect so you can get it to say edgy things. The company Nvidia bought is Groq (with a Q). Totally different beast. If you’ve used any high quality LLM, you’ve noticed it takes a while to generate a response. Especially for something rapid fire like a conversation, you want high quality AND speed. But speed is often what gets sacrificed. There’s always that “thinking... gathering my notes... taking some time to form the best response” delay. Groq specialized in hardware and software that makes this way faster. They created a new type of chip called an LPU (Language Processing Unit). It’s based on an ASIC, an application specific integrated circuit. If that’s confusing, don’t worry about it. It’s just a processor that does a specific type of task really well. So imagine you’re talking to Gemini and it takes a couple seconds to respond. Now imagine it responded instantly, like 10 or 100 times faster. That’s the problem Groq was solving. To go one level deeper on LPUs versus GPUs (the processors most LLMs run on, typically Nvidia cards): those GPU calculations have to access a lot of things in memory. Nvidia’s chips depend on HBM, high bandwidth memory. But LPUs use something called SRAM that’s much faster to reference. Think about it like this. Your wife has a grocery list for you. You go to the store but forget the list. Every time you’re in an aisle, you have to call her on the phone: “Hey, do I need anything from the bread aisle?” Get the bread. Put the phone down. Go to the next aisle. “Hey, do I need anything from canned goods?” And so on through produce, meat, pick up the beer, check out, get home. Very inefficient. Groq’s approach is like you just took the list to the store. Get to a new aisle, look at the list. Next aisle, look at the list. Much faster than a phone call. That’s the key difference. Nvidia GPUs are phoning out every time they hit a new aisle. Groq’s LPUs mean the shopper has the list in their pocket. Groq’s main offering is GroqCloud. An engineer like me isn’t going to go out and buy an LPU (I don’t even know if they’re commercially available). What I’m going to do is, if I need lightning fast response in an application I’m building, I’ll use GroqCloud. That inference happens at an extremely fast rate, running on LPUs in a data center somewhere. Their value prop is: fast, cheap, low energy. Where they’ve been falling short is they mostly use open source models. Llama, Mistral, GPT-OSS (OpenAI’s open source offering). These are decent models, but nowhere near the quality of something like Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro. Groq positioned themselves for hardcore use cases where milliseconds matter. One of their big industry fits is real time data analysis for Formula 1. When your driver’s out there on the track, you don’t have time to send a query to Gemini and wait 20 to 30 seconds to figure out if you should pit this guy for new tires this lap. You want something like Groq which does pretty good analysis, really really really fast. This is insider baseball you’re going to miss from mainstream news headlines. The media is paying attention to Grok (Elon’s chatbot), not Groq (the chip company). This isn’t a conspiracy, it’s just that the only people aware of Groq are software developers and tech nuts like me. This is a canary in the coal mine for worse things to come in 2026. About a year ago, Groq announced a $1.5 billion infrastructure investment deal with Saudi Arabia. They also secured a $750 million Series D funding round. These are crazy multiples even for a software company that’s somewhat leveraged in hardware. Bubble level projections. To visualize $1.5 billion: if you cashed that check out in $100 bills and stacked them one on top of another, it would reach a five story building. For ordinary plebeians like us, at the average US salary of around $75K, you’d need to work 20,000 years to earn that. At that time, the company was valued at $2 billion. Hello bubble. Then in maybe one of the best rug pulls of all time, in July they quietly changed their revenue projections to $500 million.1 A 75% cut in four months. I’ve never seen anything like that since the 2008 financial crisis. Prefer to Watch the Video This was a company valued at $2 billion, enough that the government of Saudi Arabia was investing at that valuation. Then they took a 75% haircut four months later without anything major happening. If it can happen to Groq, who else can it happen to? Nvidia? Intel? The rumors started flying on Christmas Eve. Confirmed the 26th: Nvidia will be buying Groq, their key product line, and key personnel including the CEO, for $20 billion. Let’s walk through that again: February: $2 billion valuation July: Down to $500 million December: Nvidia buys them for $20 billion after they took a 75% haircut What is going on? This is a bubble. The only explanation is this is a fear purchase. Groq was promising faster, cheaper, more efficient, less electricity use for their chips. But they couldn’t scale fast enough to compete with the vendor lock in and buddy system Nvidia has going. Nvidia’s buying them with their insanely inflated war chest. They don’t want a chunk taken out of their market share. They can’t afford to take that chance. So it’s like they’re just saying: “Shut up, take the $20 billion, walk away from this project.” This is a sign that in order to succeed, Nvidia needs a monopoly on the market. Otherwise they would not pay ten times the company’s valuation that was then decreased by 75%. This is a desperate move to consolidate the market into “you have to go with us.” Saudi Arabia didn’t keep that $1.5 billion sitting around. They redirected it to Nvidia and AMD instead. Nvidia still gets paid ofc. Smaller competitors like Cerebras and Inflection, doing things in Groq’s space or exploring different architectures for AI inference, are canceling IPOs, dropping like flies, seeking emergency funding. The chatter I’m hearing from VCs and friends in that world? Ain’t nobody buying it right now. Google made their own chip. Microsoft and Amazon are racing to make competition chips that run on less electricity, are more efficient, faster. But no matter what anybody does, the market is consolidating around the Nvidia monopoly for AI hardware. Engineers like me and architects at large enterprises are trying to escape this. Once they consolidate enough of the market, they can set their price for chips and usage. If you don’t own them, you go through Oracle or some cloud computing service, and they can charge whatever they want because there will be no competitors. Even a competitor having a rough time but getting some traction? They just buy them out for $20 billion because with this monopoly going, that’s pocket change. $20 billion is a rounding error to Nvidia. The AI infrastructure boom ran on one large errant assumption: that power is cheap and plentiful. That assumption was very, very wrong. We’ve seen parts of the power grid fail, go unmaintained. There’s a great article on Palladium called “The Competency Crisis” that explains some of what’s going on in the US right now. Electricity is now the bottleneck. It’s the constraint. Too expensive or you can’t get enough of it. Who’s paying these costs? The tech companies aren’t. Trump is meeting with Jensen Huang, with Sam Altman. He hasn’t been over my place lately. He hasn’t invited you to the White House to talk about how you can’t afford groceries and eggs cost three times what they did a few years ago. No. You and I are going to pay to subsidize the electricity constraints. US data centers are using about 4% of all electricity right now. If growth continues at the same rate, in ten years they’ll use 9%. Almost one tenth of all electricity generated in the US. I’m not much of an environmentalist. But even someone like me, pretty jaded to some amount of waste because of industrialization, something like this actually makes my stomach turn. In places with lots of data centers, AI heavy regions, they’re experiencing about a 250% increase in energy costs compared to just five years ago. That’s huge. Even compared to grocery costs, which are out of control. At least with food you have alternatives. Red meat too expensive? Buy chicken. Chicken too expensive? Buy eggs. But electricity? You have to run electricity. It’s a public utility. You can’t just “use a lot less” when your bill goes up 2.5x. Let me walk you through what happens. Some business development guy from Oracle wants to build a new data center in Rural America. A year before it’s even built, they meet with city officials, maybe the governor. They grease the right people. Get legislation passed with the utility companies that says they’ll pay a preferential rate for electricity because they’re going to use a shit ton. They’re Oracle or Nvidia, they’re good for it. They pay five years upfront. Then the utility decides what to do with the rest of the electricity. The grid is strained. They want everyone else to use less. They can’t just tell them to use less, so they keep raising the price until naturally you just can’t afford to use more. You turn the lights off. Turn the TV off. Get those LED bulbs that disrupt your sleep. Do everything to keep electricity costs down. But you and I are left holding the bag. The data center folks aren’t paying for that, they paid upfront at a preferential rate. Senate Democrats are allegedly investigating this. I’ll believe it when I see it. These tech companies have their hooks so far into influential politicians. It’s a vote grab. I’d be happy to be wrong about that, but I know I’m not going to be. I talked about this in my last piece on the AI bubble. This computer communism that’s going on, pricing you out of personal computing, keeping it all in the family of these tech companies. But with the Groq deal confirmed, it’s gone one step further. Nvidia is not just selling chips anymore. They are lending money to customers who buy the chips. They are artificially inflating demand. It’s like if I run a small grocery store and I need to show good signal to investors that I’m bringing cash in the door. So I go downtown during farmer’s market and give everybody a $20 voucher to use at my store. I take a wholesale hit when they come in and buy stuff. But what I can show is: “Hey, people are coming in and spending money. Look at the revenue. Give me more venture capital money.” This can’t work infinitely, for the same reason any perpetual motion machine can’t work. Back in September, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. Coming through in $10 billion tranches over time. And it’s not equity, it’s lease agreements for Nvidia’s chips. Literally paying them to pay themselves.There’s probably some tax shenanigans going on there since they’re typically offering $xxx in leases of their chips to the company they’re “lending” to. Assuming they do this in part because the depreciation on the physical asset (the chips) can be written off on their taxes somehow. They’re essentially incentivizing another person to use them with money. Even OpenAI’s CFO has admitted, quote: “Most of the money will go back to Nvidia.” They’re playing both sides. In the OpenAI case, they’re financing software that uses their chips. But they’re also getting their hooks into data centers. CoreWeave: they have something like 7% share in the company. Worth $3 billion. That’s funded by GPU revenue from CoreWeave. Lambda: another data center operator. That’s a $1.3 billion spending deal. Renting Nvidia’s own chips back from them. They’ve pledged to invest £2 billion across British startups, which of course are going to go back to Nvidia chips one way or another. In 2024, they invested about $1 billion across startups and saw a $24 billion return in chip spend. They 24x’d their billion dollar investment in one year. Nvidia has more power than the Fed right now. More power than the president over the economy. They have their hand on the knob of the economy. They can choose how fast or slow they want it to go. If the Nvidia cash machine stops printing, if they stop funding startups, data centers, hardware companies, software companies, that whole part of the economy slows way down and maybe crashes if investors get spooked. I’m waiting for somebody to blow the whistle on this. I’m not a finance guy, so it’s strange I’m even talking about it. But their entire success story for the next couple years hinges on their $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which they’re expecting to bring back about $300 billion in chip purchases. It’s vendor financing. It’s sweetening the pot on your own deals. I cannot believe more people are not talking about this. OpenAI, the leader of this space, the company whose CEO Sam Altman is invited to the White House numerous times, probably has a direct line to Trump, a lot of the economy hinges on this guy’s strategy, opinions, and public statements. And he runs a company that is not profitable. Actually insane if you think about it. All he’s done with that company, from an economics point of view, is rack up debt. Spent more than he’s earned. By that metric, I’m richer than Sam Altman. Not in net worth. But if I consider myself a business and the fact that I bring in any salary at all, even a dollar a year, that would make me earn more than Sam Altman, who has only lost money. In the next few years, they’re expected to burn something like $75 billion a year. Just set that money on fire. I have a credit card with no preset spending limit, but I assume if I run up a $75 billion charge it’s going to get denied. By their projections, they think they’ll become profitable around 2029/2030, and they need $200 billion in annual revenue to offset their debts and losses. To visualize $200 billion: if you cashed that out in $100 bills and stacked them, it would reach halfway to the International Space Station. That’s how much they’d have to make every single year to just be profitable. Not be a massively successful company. Just to not spend more than they earn. 2024: Spent $5 billion, earned $3.7 billion. Spending $1.35 for every dollar earned. 2025: Set $8 billion on fire (after profits). 2028 (projected): Will lose $74 billion that year. Just lose it. Cumulative losses through 2029: $143 billion. They’d need to make $200 billion in a year to offset that. Are they including interest? I have no idea how these things work, but in simple terms: they’re spending a lot more money than they make. Groq was kind of a one off because Nvidia panic bought the competition. But they also need to figure out how to get prices down or they can’t keep this money machine moving. Groq is probably one of the last companies that caught a good lifeboat off a sinking ship. What we’re going to see this year: it’ll start small, but get major. A company first, then multiple larger ones, that had a 2025 valuation, will go to raise. They’ll do a 409A evaluation. A bunch of smart analysts will say what it’s worth to investors. And you’re going to see the valuation drop. They won’t be able to raise money. Then the shit is really going to start to hit the fan. The dominoes will start falling. That’s probably what kicks off the actual pop, and it’s imminent. Any day now. Part of the big gamble they’ve sold investors is: we’ve got to replace you. The worker. That’s why we need to spend so much money, go into debt. It’ll all be worth it because then we won’t have to pay people to do these jobs anymore. We’re going to continue to see massive labor displacement. To a degree this is a shell game, an investor illusion. What these larger enterprise companies are hoping to do: cut a lot of folks, have big layoffs, say it’s because AI is replacing the jobs. In some cases they’re right. Data entry, for example. I don’t mean to be mean if you do data entry for a living, but there are models very good at that now. You need someone to manage the work, spot check it. But it’s kind of a job AI can do. Like how grocery stores have automatic checkout lines now with one person monitoring six or eight of them. So some of that’s real. A lot of it isn’t though. They cut a bunch of American workers under the guise that AI’s replacing workers. A lot of these megacorp execs are actually convinced of it. Americans are expensive, especially tech workers. Then they see: damn, maybe we could have cut some, but not as many. We got greedy. Now our services are failing in production. AWS in Northern Virginia is flaky, going down again. That just happened, by the way, direct result of these layoffs. So instead they think, “We’ll look globally! Spin up a campus in Hyderabad!” Pay them way less. The cost of living is less there, they expect less. Bring them over on H-1B when needed. I’ve written about the H-1B program. This is nothing against the individuals on that program. I’ve worked with very talented H-1Bs, and some very inferior ones, just like American citizens. But the corporate sleight of hand is something like this, we can get those H-1B visas, and they’re not going to ask for pesky stuff like Sunday off for church. We can put them on call 24/7 and they can’t say no because if they do, we kick them back to their country. Same thing that’s happened with migrant labor in farming over the past century. Even if it doesn’t look like it on the surface, corporations know that they can pay H-1B employees less than American citizens. If a US citizen and H-1B recipient both make $120k but the H-1B works double the hours because they have no room to push back and are under threat of being sent home, they are making 50% less than the American per-hour. Amazon/AWS: 14,000 laid off. Microsoft: 15,000 total just in 2025. Salesforce: My favorite one. 4,000 customer support roles cut. And the CEO is gloating about it in interviews. So great that he can replace workers! Now Salesforce is admitting that they fucked up. They cut too many people. I’ve been on the other side of this when I was an engineering director at a Fortune 500 company. They were neurotic about tracking AI use. Spending an exorbitant amount of money on shitty AI tools. Like tools from a year ago. GPT-4o in the GPT-5 era, in the Anthropic dominance era. More or less useless. Not only would they monitor all usage across employees, specifically who’s using it how much, they could see every single message being sent to the AI. So theoretically you could check somebody’s queries and do a performance evaluation based on where you perceive them to be. Pretty creepy. They’re using yesterday’s tools because of regulation and compliance, blowing an absurd amount of money. The CEO just sees a lot going out the door: “I thought these were supposed to save money, what’s going on here?” So his lieutenants have to get a grip on it, monitor everything. Even at Amazon this is being included in performance reviews, how much they’re using AI. That’s why if you’re a software developer wondering why your boss is on you about using AI tools. They’re probably getting pressure from their bosses. I want my engineers to be as productive as possible. I think AI is probably part of that tool belt for everyone at this point. But is tracking it really the best way? I’m going to gauge performance on metrics, how you interacted with the team, what you shipped. It puts the cart before the horse to say you’re paid by how much you use these AI tools. If I’m a developer, I’m just spinning up a script to send lorem ipsum text 24 hours a day, get maximum ratings because I used GPT-3.5 the most. MIT did a study in summer 2025. They’re saying 95% of companies report zero measurable ROI on AI products. Actually not that crazy if you consider that a lot of them did layoffs and subbed in AI. That’s just going according to plan in my estimation. They estimate about $30 to $40 billion has been spent on enterprise AI. That’s the money your JPMorgan Chase is spending for their engineers to use Claude Code or whatever dated tool they have access to. The market heard that signal. When that study came out: Nvidia crashed 3.5% Palantir down 10% Nasdaq in general down 1.2% That last one isn’t encouraging for an AI bubble pop because it indicates this is a big part of the economy. January through February: Maybe down valuations, just a very flat market without much growth. Q1 to Q2: We’ll start to see a couple businesses, or maybe one major one at first like a domino starting to fall, not able to raise capital at their 2025 valuation. We’ll see valuations go down. VCs will be like: “Not touching it, not giving them more money, cutting our losses.” Then timing a little more indeterminate but these things will happen quickly in succession: Credit markets start to tighten Debt refinancing pressure builds up in the system Nvidia revises its revenue guidance to something at least vaguely linked to reality And that’s when the big reckoning begins. I want to be clear. AI is not going anywhere. It’s going to continue being a mainstream part of the world. I like a lot of these tools, I think they’re very helpful. But the talking heads have really promised us the world. It’s clear the technology cannot deliver above and beyond what it’s doing now. We’ve seen progress of these models slow at an exponential rate of slowing over the past few releases. Each release is better, but the gap between the current release and the last release is much smaller than it used to be. Because of that, a lot of these AI companies are going to survive, but their valuations are going to get giga slashed. Valuations of $500 billion for OpenAI, $42 billion for Anthropic are unsustainable. We’re going to actually see them become unsustainable in 2026 as they’re eventually cut. Smaller companies will face those slashes first. But it’s coming for the major AI labs as well. This is good news, honestly. This AI hype has really turned tech into something different these days, different than it used to be. While I don’t feel AI is going anywhere, I do feel we’ll get a little more back to normal once this bubble pops and resolves. What do you think? Drop a comment below.

Title: 3 Reasons Broadcom Crashed 15% on Blockbuster Earnings — And the Real Reason to Load Up Now

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / tech_BG Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar fiscal fourth-quarter results earlier this month, with record revenue, beating analyst estimates. AI-driven growth powered the performance, yet the stock tumbled sharply afterward, dropping as much as 21% from $405 per share before the report to $321 per share in the following days. While Broadcom shares have since recovered some ground, they remain approximately 15% below their pre-earnings levels. This selloff is the result of a disconnect between strong fundamentals and the market’s reaction. There are three key reasons behind the decline in Broadcom stock, but these concerns open up an opportunity for investors to buy at a lower price. Broadcom reported net revenue of $18 billion for the period, a 28% increase from $14 billion a year earlier. Semiconductor solutions revenue reached $11.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, while infrastructure software contributed $6.9 billion, up 19%. AI semiconductor revenue was exceptionally strong, rising 74% year-over-year to $6.5 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.95 per share, up 37% from the year-ago quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $12.1 billion, for margins of 68%, which was also 34% higher than last year, allowing Broadcom to generate a 36% increase in free cash flow to $7.5 billion. CEO Hock Tan highlighted the momentum, noting AI revenue growth drove the results. Broadcom also offered robust guidance for Q1, projecting revenue of $19.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year, with AI semiconductor revenue expected to double to $8.2 billion. Semiconductor revenue is forecast at about $12.3 billion, up 50%, underscoring continued demand acceleration. While AI-related order backlog of over $73 billion — deliverable over 18 months — was substantial, representing nearly half of the consolidated $162 billion backlog, was lower than anticipated for the pace of AI demand. This backlog includes custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking components like the Tomahawk 6 switch, with over $10 billion in orders for the latter alone. Management described bookings as “unprecedented” in recent months, but the specific backlog number contributed to perceptions of moderating momentum. Where gross margins were 77.9%, management said it expected a sequential decline of about 100 basis points in Q1 due to a higher mix of AI revenue, including passthrough costs in rack-level solutions. AI semiconductors, particularly custom chips and systems, carry lower margins than traditional products. Semiconductor gross margins are around 68%, compared to 93% for infrastructure software. As AI becomes a larger portion of revenue, this mix shift is expected to dilute overall margins slightly, even as absolute operating profit dollars grow. A third concern was the outlook for infrastructure software, primarily from VMware. Although segment revenue grew 19%, guidance called for low double-digit growth next year, with Q1 at $6.8 billion, only 2% higher year-over-year. This deceleration from prior rates raised questions about sustained momentum in the software segment, which has offered high-margin stability. Despite the stock’s tumble, Broadcom’s outlook remains robust, driven by accelerating AI demand that management describes as a multiyear trend. AI revenue is on track to double in Q1, fueled by custom accelerators and Ethernet networking. The company has also diversified its customer base, adding a fifth XPU client with a $1 billion initial order for delivery in late 2026, alongside follow-on commitments worth $11 billion from existing hyperscalers. Networking backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion, reflecting strong deployment needs. Moreover, bookings have surged recently, with visibility into leading-edge nodes and advanced packaging secured through facility expansions. Non-AI semiconductors remain stable, supported by a recovery in broadband. Broadcom continues to deliver strong capital returns, raising its dividend 10% and extending a $7.5 billion repurchase program. These factors point to sustained growth in 2026 and beyond. Broadcom is likely to surprise the market in future earnings reports with its strength, making the drop in its stock today the time to buy. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Tech layoffs in 2025: From TCS to Amazon — these IT firms laid off over 1,00,000 employees amid AI reshaping market

Amid artificial intelligence (AI) shaping the market, tech layoffs continue to hit workers across the world following a bruising year, in which over 100,000 people lost their jobs. Although the pace of layoffs has slowed slightly over the last few weeks, the impact remains significant, with around 122,549 tech workers being laid-off from 551 tech companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Some of the biggest pink slips came from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Salesforce, Amazon, and Microsoft — collectively affecting hundreds of employees. These job cuts are often linked to artificial intelligence, as companies are looking for ways to cut expenses amid rising costs from inflation and tariffs. In such times, hiring fewer employees and relying on AI can seem like an appealing short-term solution for companies. Several major tech companies have announced large scale of workforce reductions this year. Some notable examples of these layoffs include: — Amazon: The e-commerce giant announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history in October this year, slashing 14,000 corporate job roles, as it seeks to make more investments in its “biggest bets” which includes AI. — Microsoft: The US-based tech giant has cut a total of 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent restructuring announcement coming in July, which saw 9,000 employees losing their jobs. — TCS: India's largest tech company also joined the wave of companies laying off its employees. It announced a 2% reduction in its workforce, equating to nearly 12,000 jobs, which sent shockwaves to the country's IT industry. The company also refused claims that the job losses were due to AI replacement, citing skills mismatch and an evolving business model as the real reasons behind the move. — Intel: The chipmaker announced in July that it had mostly completed cutting 15% of its workforce. Intel had employed 109,800 people at the end of 2024, with 99,500 of them classified as ‘core employees’. However, the chipmaker said that it wants to end the year with around 75,000 core employees. — Salesforce: The company's CEO Marc Benioff confirmed in September that 4,000 customer support workers had been cut at the firm with the help of AI. He had revealed over the summer that AI was already doing up to 50% of the work at the company. However, some recent news reports also indicate that alongside these cuts, Salesforce is also planning to hire more staff. — HP: In November, the PC maker said that it plans to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs globally through fiscal 2028 as it aims to streamline operations and integrate artificial intelligence across workflows to speed up product development, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity. — Apple: According to a Bloomberg report, iPhone maker Apple has laid off dozens of sales workers across the United States in November, in a rare job cut for the tech giant. Although the exact number could not be verified. — Meta: As per news reports, Instagram's parent company Meta said in October that it plans to lay off 600 employees in its AI division, with the aim to build new products faster. — Google: The tech giant laid off 100 of its employees in design-related roles in October as part of its ongoing push to accelerate its AI agenda. A month earlier, the company had also reportedly cut more than 200 contractors working on its AI projects, including Gemini and AI Overviews. — Verizon: The US wireless carrier announced in November that it will lay off more than 13,000 employees marking its largest single job cut drive triggered by plans to shrink costs and restructure operations. — Siemens: The German tech firm cut 5,600 jobs at its Digital Industries business in March. The job cuts amount to a little more than 8% of the 68,000 people employed in Digital Industries globally.

And if the author was prepared to pay forty-four bucks for two of them, it just goes to show you that he has more dollars than sense. I’m hoping he made more than that for the article and can chalk it up as an expense. The author got paid for the article. It’s business expense. Re: Hainan The author of that tweet and substack doesn’t seem to understand that for the past 3 decades or so, every business that has sought to sell in China, manufactures in China. Importing has always been a fraught business for any company in China, there are just too many bureaucratic obstacles for anything except raw materials imports. The move to offshore to Vietnam, Indonesia, etc., has been driven by exporters from China, not companies wishing to sell in China. Since it’s just a customs free area for China, it will almost certainly only attract investments from companies already within China, and already selling within China. There may be good regional development reasons for this, but in terms of overall growth, its not likely to generate any real investment – this is why (for example), the Tories proposed Freeports around the UK went nowhere. Most likely, the justification is internal, specifically to complete the weakening of HK and Macau as economic powerhouses. Shanghai has already take up much of HK’s former financial role. There may also be a desire to create an alternative growth pole away from the traditional arc from the Yellow Sea to the Yangtze Delta. If it does indicate a strategic reset towards the western seaboard of China, then the Vietnamese in particular will be looking very closely at how to respond. Oddly enough, the best stats I could find from my neck of woods, only around 8% of the companies that export to China have a subsidiary there – the 92% manufacture somewhere else (mostly here). That is from 2023, so it indeed falls within the last three decades. Already over a decade ago I heard a comment by the CEO of Genelec that “one can’t compete with the Chinese in price, the secret is to make so good stuff the Chinese come and buy it regardless of the price”. “Trump tempers Zelensky’s optimism on peace plan The Hill” links to an Axios article. Here’s the correct link: https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5663887-trump-zelensky-peace-plan/ From the Axios article: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Axios on Friday that he hopes to agree on a framework with President Trump for ending the war when they meet on Sunday. Zelensky also revealed he’s willing to bring that plan up for a referendum if Russia agrees to a ceasefire of at least 60 days” They just keep playing the “ceasefire” broken record as if the Russians are somehow gonna fall for it if they repeat it long enough. I imagine now that they need a ceasefire to hold the referendum. True brain geniuses in the British government these days. Thanks, fixing. I had considered linking to the Axios piece but its headline claim was bogus. Mercouris has already picked apart Zelensky’s offer that Axios depicted as new (adding the “60 day” specifier does not change the basic idea). “Have Germans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?” The answer is probably no as German media is all in on the propaganda effort and everything that Germans say online is being watched like a hawk with punishment meted out from time to time. Plus alternate views are banned in Germany and the EU such as the Russian RT & Sputnik. I mean here, you may as well ask ‘Have Americans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ or ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ The answers to both questions would also apply to the Germans. Rev Kev: ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise.’ Actually, the majority have, I’d guess. The problem is the media and TPTB relentlessly keep shoveling the sh*t to allow no break in the narrative. such as the Russian RT I’m typing this in a hotel room in Munich. No problem getting RT. You are blessed, channels such as press tv,russia today have been removed from circulation in my tiny and toney part of the collective west. When I’ve visited in Deutschland, MSNBC and Bloomberg are the only english language options. Their view of the world rarely chimes with my experience or understanding of it. Slop did not start with the AI con. That’s an odd one that. Back in 2022 the EU banned RT & Sputnik for “disinformation”- https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-bans-rt-sputnik-banned-over-ukraine-disinformation-2022-03-02/ And yet a 2024 article states that in many EU countries you can still get them. Then again the European parliament wants to ban them from its IT infrastructure as of a few months ago. So maybe a rule more honoured in the breach sort of situation? Indi Samarajiva, at it again. They Corrupt and Call It Peace. Or, they are corrupt and what they deign to offer as peace is rotten. An observation well known in Europe (although not acknowledged by most of the media outlets): “Von der Leyen failed upwards by A) doing corrupt defense deals on her phone and deleting evidence in Germany B) doing corrupt vaccine deals on her phone and deleting evidence for the EU. What mere mortals would consider ruinous scandals are really just a successful job application within White Empire.” What Indi Samarajiva reports has been covered here at Naked Capitalism, but you should read the essay because it is compact, well argued, and spicy indeed. Oreshniks to Belarus — https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1221212/possible-oreshnik-deployment-in-belarus/ Not unexpected, of course. Of the two authors here, back when I was doing journalism I used Lewis as a source and my sense was, while he’d no technical knowledge (degrees in policy and philosophy bs) as long as he was backed up/fronting for a technical person) he was sort of okay. He has a technical person as a co-author here. The British tabloid press is soberly reporting on all this, of course– Russia moves terrifying hypersonic nuclear missiles closer to UK in WW3 terror https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2150812/russia-moves-terrifying-hypersonic-nuclear-missiles TBF, the Daily Express also reported last week that Russian troops were forced to eat each other as they were not being supplied with food. https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2148914/putins-desperate-troops-so-short The Express is probably the worst of the rabid right wing British tabloids. Take whatever they report and how they frame reporting with a bushel of salt rather than a pinch. Pavel Podvig relating to Lewis´s post: Oreshnik in Belarus? There are reasons to be skeptical https://russianforces.substack.com/p/oreshnik-in-belarus Podvig posted the only comment under the Lewis post btw. p.s. However I am not sure any more what to think about Lewis…his proximity to Dems. is odd and out of place. Am always suspecting he downplays or overplays things depending on what may be fitting ideology best. Just like the last paragraph: “(…) impending deployment of Typhon to Germany, and possible future deployments of Dark Eagle (…) Although these systems are purely conventional, Putin has raised the prospect that they could be converted to nuclear-armed systems that could decapitate the Russian leadership in Moscow. This is precisely what he is now doing, by placing Oreshnik in Belarus. (…)” Right! Because Belarus is bordering to Virginia. I didnt´know that. “Why Does the West Hate Russia?” I’m not sure what is to be done here. This hatred goes back at least two centuries and is firmly embedded in the EU countries especially the Baltic States. It is even worse in the UK but mostly in the political elite who are rabid over the subject of Russia. And through emigration, these hatreds have made their may across the Atlantic and has found fertile ground in Washington DC. Victoria Nuland may be an example here. I’m not sure how you dig your way out of this hatred which right now is warping the policies of many western countries to the point that they are destroying their own country in a vague hope of destroying Russia. I don’t know if the Sachs essay that was linked there has been in the NC links but it’s a very good read. I learned a few things, especially about the machinations on German neutrality and eventual rearmament in the 1950s. https://consortiumnews.com/2025/12/24/jeffery-sachs-two-centuries-of-russophobia-rejection-of-peace/ My view of Adenauer is diminished, not that I had any belief that he was a great statesman. It’s too bad that Sachs didn’t get into the Sino-Soviet split, De Gaulle recognizing the PRC, Nixon going to China, etc. I always wonder how much Russophobic treachery was involved in those events. Fascinating stuff. Hate is a strong word. I’d call it a healthy distrust. My ancestors have dealt with several Russian invasions. I do not doubt that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again someday. If the Baltics keep cozying up to the corrupt US and Western Europe and promoting warmongering crazies like Kaja Kallas, you prophecy will no doubt become true. Yes, calling Russians “orcs” and Russia “Mordor” is healthy, humanizing and perfectly normal way to express distrust 🥲 And as Sachs points out, Russia has many reasons for holding a “healthy distrust” of Europe. But I’m curious. When you say you “do not doubt” that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again, on what is this certainty based? The past? Because I have seen no evidence whatsoever of this likelihood after the fall of the Soviet Union, and (as Sachs also points out) much evidence of Russia’s desire for European integration. On the other hand, Russian fears of invasion by the West were reinforced by US/NATO actions almost immediately after the Soviet collapse, and continue to be. I’m not naive. I’m not trying to whitewash past Russian actions, and I understand the effects on historical memory and prejudice. But I honestly cannot see the evidence for such fears of some new Russian imperialist expansion. I am honestly interested in what such evidence might be. Especially since, as I say, there is plenty of reason for Russia to fear the West. “Invade” is a dodgy concept these days. Note that Kaja Kallas included, iirc, 1944 among her “Russian invasions.” I’m not so naive as to believe Russia does not “invade” in general, but they tend to be “defensive” in nature, afaict, such that potential invaders can generally avert by playing diplomacy carefully (see Cold War Finland, and, to a lesser degree, most of the Eastern Bloc–Of course, how much room the countries on the other hand might be quite limited and Russians might not give them too much leash–eg Czechoslovakia in 1968. But such interventions strike me as both more complex than mere “invasions” and not particularly unusual in Great Power-Small Power politics, unpleasant though they might be.) In the real world, attitudes toward Russia differ wildly across Eastern Europe. Usually, but not always, this follows the Orthodox/Western Christianity line of demarcation, but for instance in Slovakia national identity is historically bound up with pan-Slavism and hence Russia. “Eastern Europeans all hate and fear Russia” is just propaganda. Usually the people who say this are from the Baltics, Romania, or Western Ukraine, where it is coupled with an idea that “we are defending Europe from the Asians,” which I suspect (I 100% know in the case of WU) is linked to their past as allies of Germany in WW2. Ally of Germany carries a lot of water for a Romanian. The first to snatch a piece from the territory of Greater Romania was Germany, to pay upfront Hungary as a future ally. Then it allowed USSR to take Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940. Romania joined Germany in order to recover those territories lost because of Germany. And then it changed sides and regained Northern Transylvania… With allies like Germany… n=1 but….A very good friend, Polish, opened Dun & Bradstreet’s office in Moscow in 1994. She got on swimmingly with the Russians. But she was not a typical Pole. Among other things, her family harbored Jews during WWII. Russia is the biggest part of Eastern Europe (and used to be much bigger), so your prophecy is true by default. As a matter of fact they are invading Eastern Europe as we speak. Nostradamus stuff indeed. Also. it’s funny that you fail to give any deatils of your ancestors, and their dealings with all those unprovoked full-scale invasions. Reminds me of a recently erect memorial in Canada, that had to blank the names of the “victims”. My Lithuanian ancestors invaded Russia and occupied some of it for almost 2 centuries. I have no doubt the Balts, Poles, Germans along with their western European allies aspire to control Russia again. My deceased elders and Lithuanian relatives HATE Russia and Russians; nothing healthy about that. They have a KKK and Nazi mentality. This goes back to the schism. In Bulgaria (Eastern Orthodox) there is a distinct subset of people with Russia Derangement Syndrome that borders on clinical pathology. There’s no informed argument to be had with them, everyone who exhibits even a mild doubt as to the immaculate blamelessness of the West for the war is automatically labeled a Putinist. Which is kind of funny, considering that they bring up historical grievances going even further back in history than Putin. That is kind of odd, given that it was largely the Russian army that created the independent (in practice, at least) Bulgaria. Well, their answer for that is that Russia didn’t do it out of pure altruism. Which is at least partly the case, but these are creatures wedded to moral absolutism towards others, if only rarely willing to acknowledge their own failings in the morality department. People seem to forget – social networks – especial the haves at a given moment in time “that perceive” a loss of status – ???? [waves@Ayn Rand sorts] – be it power too shape reality or material wealth … don’t go poof when one age cohort expires … its passed down as environmental bias e.g. this whole world is full of peoples[tm] that at one time were BSD and then poof … I think Toynbee was correct about the basic 3 levels of any society. In saying that I had some fun with my Samsung TV a few years ago as it had a Samsung channel that depicted early European/Asia&Minor history. Used to speed it up and the contracts made and broken between ruling classes was Epic … so much cannon fodder … Yes, partly it’s the perceived loss of status by the “landed gentry” (given Ottoman rule, they became landed and propertied by way of scammery, thievery and thuggery after independence, often legitimizing their gains by supporting the anti-Russian governments after Reunification). It’s little wonder that that the most vociferous russophobia one encounters is from members of the so-called “restitute class”, whose restored properties in choice locations in and around Sofia make them a genuine rentier class exuding a sense of superiority that’s backed by little else other than having inherited said properties. Oh, yeah, Russians invaded Bulgaria in 1877, who can forget that unprovoked invasion… It’s a bit more complicated than that, going back to revolutionary activities prior to the war and some less than helpful Russian imperial meddling in the revolutionary organizing. That’s what empires do, but these fine “history truthers” conveniently turn blind eye to anti-Bulgarian German, Austrian, British and French meddling at that period, as it would force them to enter the realm of Realism. They prefer to inhabit the much more gratifying realm of hypocritical morality posturing on the so-called “European values,” which would be great if they were ever actually applied in practice… Old Sam Huntington and his Clash of Civilizations. The map in the linked page shows that fault line. Huntington really lost marbles with the Clash of Civilizations, IMHO. For the great powers, there is something there, although not quite for the reasons that he thinks. For the lesser powers, he’s completely off–countries like South Korea and Vietnam might belong to the same “civilization” as China, but that actually furthers the ambiguity, not lessens it (Taiwan, which is actually “Chinese” illustrates the problem better, in fact. For that matter, why is Japan of a different “civilization” from China?). The problem with Huntington’s glib thinking is that “civilization” as a political identity is a mushy concept, semi-artificially created and maintained. That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant. (Japanese imperial propaganda in Korea between 1910 and 1945 provide lots of examples that both work, fall flat on their face, and were the former but are officially remembered today as the latter–and these are countries with a lot of historical baggage both positive and negative, notwithstanding Huntington’s ignorance.). It goes a lot deeper than the simpleminded “civilizations.” (Unless you have discovered the Republic and Gunpowder?) “really lost marbles” is putting it midly. Sorry for being not very sophisticated but studying political science is like studying BS. And on top of that his life reads like piling even more of that cluelessness: Brzezinski, National Security Council, Trilateral Commission? The fact that he made this career and is still known sheds no good light on the intellectual culture. At.all. “That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant.” Exactly. I thought this would be self-evident today. But hell was I wrong. It’s been 30 years since I read Huntington and more than 50 since he read me, but I’ll undertake a partial defense. The book came out in the 90s as the Soviet Union collapsed and Fukuyama was ready to declare “game over.” Huntington steps up and says, “No, there will not be a Pax Americana or even a Pax Neoliberal. Instead, the old pattern of rivalries. along the fracture lines of language, religion and culture, will resume. One group that certainly took this seriously are the neocons, who have spent the last 30 years trying to exploit these fissures, especially in the Balkans and the Caucasus, and they’ve been pretty successful at making trouble. I know Huntington had been thinking along these lines since the mid-70s not because I had read anything of his or taken a course from him, but because he turned up as a surprise reader of my senior thesis. The subject matter was how would the arrival of lots of suburban, Republican voters in formerly Dixiecrat rural counties affect the level of political activity and participation, in other words, a mild clash of civilizations. So I think he deserves credit for having a more accurate idea of where we were headed than those who thought the end of the Cold War would end or at least greatly decrease international violence. You may be right that the “civilization” concept is mushy, and that Huntington’s analysis of the Far East is weak, but he sure seems to have gotten a lot of things right as upstater confirms with his assertion that the acrimony between Poland and the Baltics on the the one side and Russia on the other goes back to the Great Schism. Thanks for this account. I don´t want to disregard any scholar´s insight just because I do not concur with the politics behind it. But it frankly appears to me that what you did was analyze after the fact and come to a conclusion. Just what science does. Huntington on the other hand got invovled into creating a situation first which only caused the crisis. And then he was doing scholarly work about that very crisis as if it had already been in place – without any interference and assistance from his own “people” and his own ideas (“inspired” by your work in this example). I am not the expert so please forgive my superficial take: In the Arab world I often understood that, again simplified, radical Islam of the 1980s was the response to the demise of left/Communist/nationalist movements. So latter had to be destroyed first as they withstood Western imperial interests. And only when in the wake of the destruction of civil society the “healthy” fabric disintegrated would former – radical Islam – find the fertile ground and the space to take over (with a lot of help from us.) And eventually after supporting those circles of the US that had been responsible for this shift in the Middle East would Huntington come up and present his “scholarship”. It almost sounds as if he turned things upside down. (I know this is a bit exaggerated. But I hope the essence of my simple point comes across. And I assume that he probably didn´t even realize his hand in all this to some extent.) p.s. Maybe some remember the Danish caricature scandal: 20 years ago Jyllands-Posten published provocative caricatures about Muhammad. Expecting outrage. However initially there was no such reaction by the Muslim communities at all. So the editors actually sent the pictures to Muslim communities explicitly. But those again responded very relaxed and stated it didn´t really bother them. Only after these disappointing reactions did the paper force it and other papers took it up, I believe French outlets in particular. I don´t exactly remember the chronology then but I do know that almost nobody was interested in how this affair had actually started. So what happened the paper had created a scandal to sell its product. Plain and simple. And then swapped cause and effect. Oh, and nonetheless this once huge scandal has been completely forgotten. I do not believe that people hate. And elites work really really hard to bring about this hatred. And people like Huntington are part of that. In whatever twisted ways. But classic, clear-minded, honest scholarship – IMHO – never gets invovled with the politcs of the subjects it researches. Sorry for the length. I think the problem with Huntington was that he was purporting to write about the future of international order, not internal dynamics of politics within great powers. If his argument were only that great powers would seek to orient themselves around a common sense of shared civilization, that would be correct to a large degree, but that was not his primary claim. This, incidentally, is a very old critique of Huntington–that nations do not have allegiance towards allegedly shared civilizations. It came out almost as soon as the Huntington essay came out in Foreign Affairs (that was a long while before the book, I think.). Neighboring countries often share civilizations. They also have more shared interests and conflicts. These trump whatever civilizational affinity there is. They would rather align with “alien” civilization against their neighbor, or, at least, hedge their bets, which create seemingly “counter civilizational” motives. The Lithuanians I actually know express opinions on the full range as regards our neighbor-to-the-west-and-east. Not ten years ago, we were the only of the three Baltics not to have an organic anti-russian movement of any significance whatsoever. The intervening decade of influence operations against us is starting to show results, sadly. Latvians and Estonians are indeed kind of psychos. Locally, and in our drinks, it is theorized the same might have become of us if we had also allowed ourselves to be colonized and ruled by the Crusader orders. That kind of influence has to leave a mark. But “Baltics” is (weirdly) an overbroad category… The “Lithuanians” cultivated for decades in the US, UK, and Canada as weapons against Teh Commiez, on the other hand? Nazis to the core. I do remember that there were Lavian and Estonian volunteer SS divisions, but not a Lithuanian one (heck, Estonia probably raised more SS troops per capita than any other country…) Russian invasions? Most likely the arc of Russian invasions, in an active way, moved mostly east and south. In the west was in fact a scramble between empires. I.e. Bulgarians, Romanians cannot claim of being invaded by Russians, when the fights were just on their territories btw Russians and Ottomans or Austrians, Swedes, etc… There’s a pretty fundamental difference between invasion and liberation. FWIW, growing up in the U.S. during the Cold War, I and most people I met didn’t hate the Russians/Soviets. The usual take was “They’re good people with a bad government”. When later I met some people from the Soviet Union, that was their take on the U.S. This may have just been naive why-can’t-we-all-get-along-ism but I never encountered the kind of poisonous hatred other commenters are describing. The dehumanizing rhetoric in Europe must be witnessed to be believed. What we in the US would call ‘hate speech’ is fully normalized with respect to Russia and Russians, especially in former Axis allies. It was funny when my Dad who grew up in Hungary met a US Vietnam Veteran Dad, in the US. I had to translate but both had been raised with stories about how evil the other army had been. Fun memory: “thwarting Cold War fairy-tales with a lot of beer.” Dad found it really odd that you weren´t allowed to buy booze on Sundays in the bible belt. So the first time he went to the cashier and filled the cart with the finest bottles you can imagine. Until he was denied the purchase. I had to interfere and calm him down since he caused a ruckus and cursing – fortunately – in Hungarian. Which is quite bad. But few understand it. Travelled from one end of Russia to the other in the late 90s. Folks were always friendly to Americans. “You’ve never killed us.” Many of my companions were Germans and on rare occasions bitterness toward Germany from the 1940s did come up. Just absorbing what one does in general media and education, I always thought of Lithuania as one of the three Baltic tinies. I was surprised to find out that it is a former great power. Re. “Both of these influencers…” The “precious metals” sphere has had the emergence of an AI oriental looking “presenter” giving a series of very slick programs highlighting the “doomed” nature of the metals markets as presently constituted. On the “original” metals vlogs this “character” is jokingly referred to as AI Man, and yet the information “he” presents is seriously debated. The ultimate agenda of whoever is behind AI Man is still murky at best. This highlights what is possibly the greatest danger from this AI People phenomenon, the very effective value of well made AI programing as propaganda. When everybody accepts “unreality” as the new normal… I am now waiting for the emergence of AI Politicos. We call Politicos ‘fakes’ already. What’s to stop the power elites from taking that idea to its logical extreme? Stay safe. Practice your pattern recognition skills. God forbid that this does not eventually lead to a whole bunch of AI Ben Shapiros, each tailor made to a specific audience but combined creating a political movement. My initial defense to this is to stick to Youtube channels I know. This is becoming increasingly difficult as the feed is filling up with these AI fakes. The other day, I made the mistake of clicking on what I thought was Mercouris. After a minute or so, I knew it wasn’t Alexander because there was no nose-picking and no stuttering. I’ve seen fake Wilkersons, MacGregors and lots of Mearsheimers. Usually, these fakes are making outrageous claims, discrediting these commentators to people who aren’t cautious. Crazy world. We’re getting to the point where your assumption has to be any channel created after 2026-01-01 has a >50% chance of being fake or some form of astroturf. The fake-AI Bob Barker insult comedy videos make me laugh though, lmao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPitD1eYLiM Having the same experiences that you have had. It’s bad enough when YouTube keeps on shoving adds into those videos and you can see that the “presenter” is actually an AI. Hint – it’s hard for a human to talk and have a big smile on their face at the same time but that is how you pick an AI person. Best to stick to their official channels I guess. It seems that the real Mercouris, MacGregor, and Mearsheimer could file complaints with YouTube and report these channels. And per YT policy they should be taken down, just like YT took down channels spreading COVID “misinformation.” I won’t hold my breath, though. Especially because all of the real McCoys are engaged in truth telling that inconveniences the narrative that narrative makers want us to buy. Perhaps this is a deliberate move from the narrative makers to discredit alt-media and make it more difficult for them to get their message out. For one thing, it could easily affect traffic and revenue. Surely these commentators are aware this is happening. I’d like to hear them address how they’re trying to deal with this and the extent to which Youtube is cooperating. Mercouris has talked about doing that fair bit, but it seems that YT has not been as responsive as he’d have liked. (Although fake Mercouris seems rarer than others) I actively report such channels – at this point easy to spot, and block them from my feed. Hopefully if a large number of viewers do so, also, they will disappear (for the time being). We had friends and neighbors over for dinner during the Holidays. One of these families has a 22 year old young man who is quite frankly movie star handsome and is very bright. There were other kids his age here at the same time. It came up in conversation that ANY and ALL texts, emails, etc he receives with any possible dating partner are sent through AI services to a) have a full profile of the possible partner’s mental health and motivations and b) to assess their compatibility with him. Again, in my day, this would not have been a young man who would have had any problems attracting women and furthermore all of the above issues he is sending to AI would have been talked out with his closest friends. Now we ditch the friends, the locker rooms, the bar, the basketball court and hand everything over to Grok or chat GPT. What really concerned me is that every person in my house between 18-30 or so that evening informed us all that they do exactly the same thing. AI screening of all potential dates, partners, etc. This was new to me and I could scarcely believe what I was hearing. We are removing humanity from every single interaction we have. I fear for these kids when they are 50. But the other very concerning issue is that all texts, emails, any correspondence at all that has our individual names, email addresses, phone numbers, whatever are being sent to AI companies to be analyzed. And we have zero idea this is even being done. You can avoid it all you want in your life, but it is becoming increasingly clear that AI has no intention at all of avoiding you. Please, anyone, help me find a bright spot here. Do you think this is a truly representative experience for the US or rather fringe? Bright spot? Not bright: But maybe things happening later in their lives which will render this new way of connecting less attractive. Life has a way of messing things up, doesn´t it? As they say in German: “Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt”/”Man proposes, God disposes.” (I assume the idea of a “ghost in the machine” too is related to the chaos-oriented hope that not all can be planned and manipulated incessently in an AI-controlled society.) Sometimes you have to dodge people walking down the street who are staring at their phones. Re Doc’s tale presumably any kid who is off the electronic grid never gets a date–the new definition of a wallflower. Filmmaker John Hughes would have made much of this. Ned Ludd would not have been on any social media. The “moderne” habits of social media use are quite understandable if viewed through the lens of conformism as a social organizing strategy. Being in the world but not of it is very hard. I try and generally fail in that endeavour. However, I continue trying. The main point about any of the so called AIs we encounter is that they are simple tools for others. A computer program has no agency. As the Late Lamented Lambert remarked, code is law. Learn who or what lies behind an AI and you are half way to mastering said AI. As for the use of AIs in general; I have noticed that many people are prone to searching out the “easy way” to accomplish difficult tasks. Thinking is hard. It takes will power to ‘buckle down’ and do the hard work when a supposedly “easy” fix is available. I too fear for the younger cohorts. They will eventually encounter problems that AIs cannot fix for them. Then the lack of skills and training will cripple them in the face of their problems. I fear I am becoming trite, but this is nothing really new. The problems of laziness and lack of skill acquisition are perennial. Today, with the “help” of high tech, those problems have become automated, at scale. As the “adults” in the room, so to speak, our task is the difficult one of finding those of the younger cohorts who can be helped and are willing to try. We are now entering a period of Social Triage. Stay safe, strong and resilient. A friend who has a Gen Z co-worker reported the following… Gen Z co-worker wanted to use ChatGPT to resolve a customer issue. Friend: “no, we shouldn’t do that.” Co-worker admitted to probably relying on ChatGT too much, but at least wasn’t as bad as co-worker’s partner, who evidently wears ear buds and has an AI app listen to all conversations with other humans. In conversation with others, this person just waits, listens to the earbuds to be told what to say by the AI, and then responds. So…. You ready to do a Butlerian Jihad now, Doc? 😉 3 tomahawks failed to explode out of 12?

And another speculation crossed my mind that may be wild to mention. Those two lying on flat ground have been put there gently, so someone is already doing some cleaning. I don’t what is worse: Lord Bebo passing off AI slop as real or people on this site falling for it. We were overdue for a feral hog story. Excellent timing! For a shorter summary of the Epstein history, see the Doug Ross item. Thank you for the link which I have bookmarked. I am three hours through the four hour Mike Benz broadcast that was in today’s links. Except for an explanation of Epstein’s entre into Bear Stearns, that link can be skipped up to about the 50 minute part (Yadda-yadda). As this outline suggests, Benz highlights many points at which Epstein’s life intersects with some very interesting characters involved in some very significant “deep history” events. At minimum he provides reasons to take the Epstein case seriously rather than write it off as simply the sensationalized actions of a “lone pervert” or (as with the NY Times) just a con-man ripping off poor unsuspecting billionaires. A lot of this is being covered in the on-going work of Ryan Grim and Drop Site News. And almost all of it has been covered earlier by Whitney Webb, who continues to be ignored by the mainstream press but also gets shafted by a lot of the alt media. I’ve been very cautious about Benz. He was a sketchy anonymous right-wing “influencer” before he suddenly exploded all over the internet as a former State Department employee and supposed intelligence expert. But much of what he says does ring true and correspond with other sources. That link is great. Also confirms my priors. I had long thought and sometimes said that Epstein was most likely an arms dealer. That is hugely lucrative. Looks like he was broadly involved in that nexus. On the name change to the Trump-Kennedy Center, it’s worth noting that the original name is The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center. A “Memorial” refers to how a society honors someone who is already dead. I doubt Trump realizes adding his name makes no sense. Second, Trump is not adding his name or building monuments to himself because he has a big ego. Rather, he knows deep down how incompetent and weak he truly is. And he spends enormous energy hiding that fact. For this reason, he realizes that when he dies nobody is going to build anything in honor to him. Or he’s just messing with people. It used to be hard to guess which part of Trump was shtick. Nowadays he seems genuinely gaga. A headstone?

I have no YT account but some channels like Pascal Lottaz are only on YT and sometimes I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. So I stopped watching. There were ad-free YT-alternatives but those disappeared and the most recent comments about the existing YT alternatives mentioned on NC recently I forgot to bookmark. I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. A wireless mouse could be one solution? I download everything I want to watch. Then watch at my own leisure, including fast forwarding and rewinding. No ads. Works on 90% of stuff out there. Then, delete to free the disk space. How do you download things? I had WonderShare for years but the algorithm changes and now I need to upgrade. Which I haven’t been able to do. media-downloader https://github.com/mhogomchungu/media-downloader I use Any Video Converter Ultimate. Free download. You just have to get a slightly older version, some 2-3 years old. Works with w10 and w11. Video Download Helper extension on Firefox works well but those more savvy than me can discuss whether the permissions make it a spybot. Firefox does offer tracking protections that may block. I never use Chrome or Safari. If you want to watch YouTube on your phone, I have heard good things about Newpipe, though I haven’t tried it myself yet. If you want an alternative site, some youtubers cross-post to Rumble, so depending on what channels you want to watch, they may already be there. Rumble is newer, so not as enshittifide yet. I use Newpipe on Android with excellent results. No ads. Download features available On desktop I use Firefox browser with the YouTube ad block extension. Also works excellently. Can’t download, but no ads. It also works with a YT account without issues. Both the above work without a YT account. If i am understanding the problem correctly. You can use the FireFox browser to watch programs like “Neutrality Studies” ad free once you install an ad blocker like “ublock Orgin” . Setting -> Extentions and Themes Then search ublock under addons Brave browser blocks utube ads by default and allows background play on android. I’m a hard-core IT nerd so I use a technique not available to most: I use the ‘yt-dlp’ program to download videos, mostly from video-game playthroughs, and watch those on a flash drive plugged into my TV. I also download long music videos for video game soundtracks, turn those into MP3 files, and play them on my phone. As part of the soundtrack project I use a program that I wrote 30 years ago and made open-source. So… not a normal responder. Youtube has lately been playing ‘arms race’ with the downloader apps, and I don’t know if they still work. Cheers, and good luck! As a medium-hardness-core IT nerd, I use 9xbuddy.com, savefrom.net, and invidio.us. The first one works on bunch of sites. FreeTube app. All ads defeated. Excellent. Thanks for the help to everyone!!! I guess I figure out the best solution. And I will bookmark this now. I don’t have a YT account so I do not understand your issue. And I watch a LOT of YT. If you use the Orion browser, it blocks YT ads. But sometime the video freezes as a result of the ad blocking and you have to restart (but it will resume where it stopped). I had a lot of ads during shows like Neutrality Studies. Every 3-5 minutes. It became impossible to listen to especially when I am not near the computer to click it away. But Lottaz is an important source. As is Patrik Baab. And several others. So I try to solve it. Pardon selling……Does no one remember Marc Rich? https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bill-clintons-last-outrage-the-presidents-defenders-feel-betrayed-by-his-pardon-of-marc-rich/ The Dhammacetiya Buddhist group is having their Walk for Peace from Fort Worth Texas to Washington DC. The group of monks has recently entered LaGrange, Georgia. Their website has a daily map, and their Facebook page has a live map. Local news stations along the path have had stories of the monks. “Photos show California slammed with heavy rain, mudslides from storm” Between the floods, the fires and the earthquakes, you sometimes wonder if California hates people and is trying to kill them off. Nah, since half the state doesn’t have seasons, earthquakes, fires, floods, and riots become our seasons. Apropos of nothing this is interesting. https://www.openculture.com/2025/12/what-pompeii-looked-like-hours-before-its-destruction-a-reconstruction.html The Pompeii/Herculaneum archaeology have been really useful because the high-class Romans who wrote all of the scrolls did not care about how everyday life worked. For example, they dug up a two-story-high wooden wheel that they used to do construction work. We had no idea!

I grew up in Northern California in the 70s, marinated in that stuff. re: In 2026, Will Americans Finally Turn Against Oligarchs? -Matt Stoller Thanks for the link. A must read, imo. Lol the so called left would never even consider withholding voters It began when Cuban American lawmakers pressed Mr. Trump early this year to end Chevron’s Biden-era confidential license. After Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio announced in late February that they would do so, Mr. Maduro stopped accepting deportation flights of Venezuelans. Mr. Maduro had agreed to them on Jan. 31 with Richard Grenell, a special envoy for Mr. Trump. Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, lobbied the administration for a license extension, speaking to Mr. Trump several times over the coming months. The Cuban American lawmakers got wind that the license could be extended, and they threatened to withhold their votes for Mr. Trump’s signature legislation, “the One Big Beautiful Bill.” At the Oval Office meeting in late May, Mr. Trump told Mr. Rubio and Mr. Miller that he needed to get the bill passed.

That was when Mr. Miller offered to help. He had been nurturing his ideas for mass deportations and boat strikes. Mr. Trump did not renew Chevron’s license when it expired on May 27.

Title: BlackRock Details ‘Most Obvious’ Megaforce Shaping Markets in 2026, Firm Remains Overweight US Stocks and AI

Asset management giant BlackRock says one powerhouse sector of the market is going strong heading into 2026. In a new report, BlackRock says the next year will be defined by artificial intelligence (AI), which the firm says is growing at an unprecedented rate and will help push the US stock market to heights it has never seen before. “We’ve long argued we’re in a world of structural transformation shaped by a few mega forces, including geopolitical fragmentation, the future of finance and the energy transition. But the most obvious now is AI, with a buildout of a potentially unprecedented speed and scale. This shift to capital-intensive growth from capital-light is profoundly changing the investment environment and pushing limits on multiple fronts – physical, financial and socio-political. A few big macro drivers implies a few big market drivers. Today’s market concentration reflects underlying economic concentration. That means investors can’t avoid making big calls, in our view. AI is the dominant mega force right now, helping propel U.S. stocks to all-time highs this year… We stay overweight U.S. stocks and the AI theme, supported by robust earnings expectations. The capex (capital expenditure) may pay off overall even if not for individual companies. The next phase may be more about energy and resolving bottlenecks.” However, BlackRock notes that AI does face challenges, such as its extremely high rate of energy consumption. “AI data centers could use 15-20% of current U.S. electricity demand by 2030 – a scale sure to test the limits of power grid, fossil and materials industries… Some estimates even suggest data centers could use a quarter of current electricity demand. Rising power demand collides with a backlog of projects waiting to connect with the electric grid and generally slow permitting in the West. Capex plans could be walked back if such limits bite, crimping ambition around the AI buildout.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Farrell and McCracken: colossal impact of Irish football legends still felt today

Time Published: 2025-12-27T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Early on in The Emerald Evertonian, a new book about the life and times of Peter Farrell, comes a remarkable detail revealing something of the status of soccer in 1930s Ireland. The young Farrell had just joined Cabinteely United, then run by an enthusiast called Christy Devlin. “The team’s ‘pavilion’,” writes author Rob Sawyer, “was a huge tree . . .” The tree was behind one goalmouth and under its branches, the players changed and deposited any valuables a 13 year-old from south Dublin might possess. Farrell saw the difference when he played Gaelic football “on much better grounds than our soccer one at Cabinteely”. He added: “We also had a well-equipped pavilion with showers at our school sports ground at Dún Laoghaire.” But Farrell was inspired, not dismayed. Even though Devlin earned little as a gravedigger, he and his wife would feed “several” boys before matches. Farrell took it all in. Early on in The Offside King, a new book about the life and times of Bill McCracken, comes his verdict on arriving at Newcastle train station at 3am, having just been transferred from Distillery. He was be met by three Newcastle United directors in “old-fashioned frock coats... I c...uldn’t help saying to myself ‘Begarra – they look more like undertakers’.” McCracken was dismayed, not inspired. But he endured his first unhappy months at St James’ Park and went on to become “a true legend of the game“, in the words of author Paul Joannou. Irish football, gravediggers and undertakers, there’s a joke in there. Farrell, from Dublin, and McCracken, from Belfast, were serious men, though. They were rich with connections great and small and these two books help build out our knowledge of who and what Irish football was and how we are where we are. This is social history as well as the charting of two fascinating football lives. Peter Farrell, for example, married Mabel Carney, whose aunt Winnie was the Winifred Carney alongside James Connolly at the GPO in 1916. The scent of independence may also have been in Farrell’s nostrils when he played in the first Ireland (FAI) international after the second World War. It was June, 1946, in Lisbon against Portugal and Farrell was made captain, even though it was his debut. That must have been some moment. Afterwards, back in Dublin at a ceremony at the Gresham hotel, he was presented with this first cap. Rather than hold on to it, maybe frame it, Farrell instead gave it to his guest at the Gresham – Christy Devlin. The big tree at Cabinteely had not been forgotten. Untold numbers of Irish soccer volunteers – and those who benefited – will recognise this reciprocal commitment and affection. In the 1910 FA Cup final replay, held at Goodison Park, McCracken was part of a Newcastle United side winning the trophy for the first time. McCracken was the penalty-taker and at 1-0 up, Newcastle were awarded one. But McCracken knew centre forward Albert Shepherd had been the subject of bribery gossip before the semi-final and was not selected. Shepherd was reinstated for the final and scored the opening goal. As McCracken passed him for the penalty, he said to Shepherd: “Fancy it? Go on, take it.” McCracken’s motivation was “to get him re-established”. Shepherd scored and entered the history books as the first player ever to score a penalty in an FA Cup final. Really, it should be McCracken. Thirty-nine years later there was another penalty in a 2-0 win at Goodison. It was England v Ireland (FAI) and Con Martin scored the spot-kick. Farrell scored the second as Ireland became the first “foreign” nation to beat England on English soil. Farrell was an Everton player by then, winning the 10th of 28 caps. He had passed through Shamrock Rovers, under the supervision of Jimmy Dunne, and won a tennis tournament in Blackrock. A dual international, he made the last of his seven Ireland (IFA) appearances six months earlier. McCracken played for Ireland (IFA), but only 16 times due to a row over pay. The blazers in Belfast barred him from selection for 11 years. Bureaucrats and Irish football. This was when McCracken was at his peak, but in asking for equal pay with English and Scottish internationals, he was deemed a troublemaker. The IFA ban extended to Irish League clubs and given there was no Border then, McCracken was effectively banned from setting foot on an a pitch anywhere in Ireland. Simultaneously, he was becoming the most talked-about footballer in England. Working in a Tyneside munitions factory during the first World War, McCracken was known for his prominent role in fundraising friendlies. It was a bit different from his reputation as a defender – ‘The Most Hated Man in Football’ was one headline. That attitude stemmed from his offside capabilities. McCracken was so efficient at offside that ‘McCrackenism’ became a term. In 1925, Law 6 of the game was changed from having three players between an attacker and goal to be onside, to two. The man from Nansen Street off the Falls Road changed the geometry of football forever. McCracken played 432 times for Newcastle United – Shay Given is one of only four players to have more appearances. Farrell played 452 times for Everton – only four men have made more league appearances for the club. Both went into management after playing, McCracken with Hull City, Gateshead, Millwall and Aldershot, Farrell with Tranmere Rovers, where his great friend and Evertonian Tommy Eglington played. Success, and failure, for both men is seen in context – neither were managing clubs with big budgets. McCracken returned to the Irish League as a Newcastle scout to sign George Eastham from Ards, then as a Watford scout to sign Pat Jennings from Newry Town. Farrell went briefly to the League of Ireland, playing three games for Sligo Rovers. It means he, Dixie Dean and Séamus Coleman, who writes the book’s foreword, are three men to have played for Everton and Sligo. Farrell went back to Britain – to Holyhead Town in Wales – then returned to Ireland for good. He managed Drogheda United briefly, then St Pat’s and TEK United. There he came to know another Devlin – Pat. Like all who came into contact with Farrell, Pat Devlin says he felt honoured to know the man. Lest anyone think this esteem is exaggerated, walk down Farrell Close in Kirkby in Liverpool, the street named after him. McCracken has less formal recognition, although his central role in changing a key law of the game will be reasserted by The Offside King, just as The Emerald Evertonian illustrates the significance of Peter Farrell. Two compelling men. Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Groq continues innovation after raisingÂ $750M (September 2025) at a $9B valuation. Nvidia solidifies dominance amid competition fromÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google TPUs. In a move that further solidifies its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, Nvidia has secured a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip startup Groq, bringing aboard its founder, CEO Jonathan Ross, and key executives to bolster its inference technology capabilities. The deal, announced by Groq on Wednesday, Dec. 24, allows Nvidia to license Groq's proprietary AI inference technology while hiring Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior engineers. Groq will continue operating independently under new CEO Simon Edwards, with its cloud platform, GroqCloud, remaining unaffected. Groq, founded in 2016 by former Google engineers, specializes in AI inferenceâthe process of running trained AI models to generate predictions or responses, such as those seen in ChatGPT or image recognition systems. The company developed its customÂ Language Processing Unit (LPU), designed for high-speed, low-cost AI inference. "AI inference, in the context of artificial intelligence, refers to the process by which AI models draw conclusions or make predictions based on input data. This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference. With competitors likeÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google's TPUsÂ vying for market share, the AI chip wars are far from over. For now, Nvidia's strategic talent grab reinforces its position as the undisputed leader in the AI revolution.

Sources include: TheEpochTimes.com BusinessInsider.com CNBC.com ChannelNewsAsia.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com Groq, founded in 2016 by former Google engineers, specializes in AI inferenceâthe process of running trained AI models to generate predictions or responses, such as those seen in ChatGPT or image recognition systems. The company developed its customÂ Language Processing Unit (LPU), designed for high-speed, low-cost AI inference. "AI inference, in the context of artificial intelligence, refers to the process by which AI models draw conclusions or make predictions based on input data. This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference. With competitors likeÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google's TPUsÂ vying for market share, the AI chip wars are far from over.

Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.) Allee Errico’s pages in Bernadette #2 9.) Pleasure Beach #1 by Josh Pettinger 8.) Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan 7.) Flea by Mara Ramirez 6.) Christine by Cyril Vilks 5.) Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons. This Slavery by Scarlett & Sophie Rickard, published by SelfMadeHero The Poet Volumes 1 & 2 by Todd Webb (self-published). Molly and the Bear by Bob and Vicki Scott, published by Simon & Schuster. Wally Mammoth: The Sled Race by Corey R. Tabor & Dalton Webb, published by HarperCollins. Tedward by Josh Pettinger, published by Fantagraphics. You and Me on Repeat by Mary Shyne, published by Henry Holt. The Horrors of Being a Human by Desmond Reed, published by Microcosm Publishing. Tuck Everlasting: The Graphic Novel by K. Woodman-Maynard, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This Beautiful Ridiculous City by Kay Sohini, published by Ten Speed Press. Raised by Ghosts by Briana Loewinsohn, published by Fantagraphics. Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb, published by Fantagraphics. Raymond Chandler’s Trouble is My Business by Arvind Ethan David & Ilias Kyriazis, published by Pantheon. The King’s Warrior by Huahua Zhu, published by Bulgilhan Press. *** (articles)(top) I hate writing best-of lists. Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Glenn Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing. Best Digital Comic — C’mon: it’s the 21st century and this category is totally irrelevant.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ... (Image Comics) So damn FUN and extremely DARK with incredible characters, genuine suspense and impeccable pacing and storytelling. The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) A beautiful and raw expression of extremely difficult experiences and emotions. Tyler provides the reader with a TRANSCENDENT experience. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore (Pantheon) An extremely important, well researched and compiled historical account of the History of Black Resistance that is lovingly told with beautiful artwork, moments of humor, ire, genuine feeling, and a whole lot of DEPTH. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees: Rite of Spring by Patrick Horvath (IDW) Disturbing and masterful, this story has got me HOOKED. There Will Be Tears by Charles Burns (Partners and Son) Drawings so insanely beautiful they will both BREAK and MEND your heart simultaneously. The Devil's Grin: Book One by Alex Graham (Fantagraphics) Exceptional writing and character development, Graham builds a STRANGE world we can identify with deeply. Viscere #2: Folk Horror edited by Katie Skelly (Stregasporca) Soothe your inner hedgewitch with this outstanding horror anthology filled with MACABRE tales by fabulous femmes. Orphan and the Five Beasts: Bath of Blood by James Stokoe (Dark Horse Comics) James Stokoe's artwork is PHENOMENAL, this outstanding limited series has great writing and a well developed universe. His take on epic battle scenes and creepy, gooey guts and gore is a pure delight. Saga de Xam by Jean Rollin and Nicholas Devil (Anthology Editions) STUNNING. This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world. Toxic Avenger by Matt Bors and Fred Harper (Ahoy Comics) Matt and Fred EXCEL at continuing the adventures of Lloyd Kaufman’s titular character, THE TOXIC AVENGER. Adventure Time (2025): The Bubbline College Special #1 by Caroline Cash This is so damn CUTE. Gorgeous artwork and coloring, a beautiful coming of age sapphic tale filled with classic Adventure Time capers and lots of chuckles. Skinbreaker by Robert Kirkman and David Finch (Image Comics) JAW-DROPPING artwork and exceptional world building make this a must read series. Moan by Junji Ito (Viz Media) HORRIFYING and delightful, I have yet to ever be disappointed by a Junji Ito book. The Confessional by Paige Hender (Silver Sprocket) GORGEOUS artwork compliments this delightfully wicked period piece about vampires, sinners and wannabe saints. Rats Eyes: a Games and Puzzles activity book (expanded 2025 edition) by Hyena Hell and Josh Bayer (self-published) Two completely unstoppable FORCES OF COMICS NATURE combine their powers to bring you a love letter to BLACK FLAG in the form of a puzzles and games book that is so damn fun, it'll completely melt ur eyeballs. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy. HONORABLE MENTION Black Cohosh, Eagle Valiant Brosi (Drawn & Quarterly) Calavera, P.I., Marco Finnegan (Oni Press) Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) Drome, Jesse Lonergan (23rd St.) Gaza in My Phone, Mazen Kerbaj (OR Books) The Giant: Orson Welles, the Artist and the Shadow, Youssef Daoudi (23rd St.) Holy Lacrimony, Michael DeForge (Drawn & Quarterly) In the End We All Die, Tobias Aeschbacher [Andrew Shields, translator] (Helvetiq) John Muir: To the Heart of Solitude, Lomig (NBM Publishing) Lovers and Haters, Gilbert Hernandez (Fantagraphics) The Magnificent Adventure, Milo Manara (Fantagraphics) The Murder Next Door: A Graphic Memoir, Hugh D'Andrade (Street Noise Books) The Pit, Erik Kriek (Living the Line) Simplicity: A Novel, Mattie Lubchansky (Pantheon Books) World within the World: The Collected Short Comix 2010-2022, Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2024 was a terrific year for the medium, with new releases by greats like Olivier Schrauwen, Rick Altergott, Maurice Vellekoop, Emil Ferris, Peter Bagge, Dash Shaw, and many others (not to mention a bumper crop of books by Charles Burns). Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1. Monsieur Chouette, David B, L'Association This is a tale about the nature of fear, the imagination and the afterlife. It's also the best thing David B has done since Epileptic. BUT: After 35 years, the trailblazing L'Association risks extinction due to production/transport costs, the squeeze on indie bookstores and the huge amount of well-publicized competition from big BD publishers. I urge you to join as a member (benefits include a discount their on their 800+ work catalogue, which gave you Epileptic, Persepolis and Emmanuel Guibert's Alan's War). Or just make a small contribution here. 2. Béla sans monde, Simon Roussin, Editions 2042 Roussin is one of today's most original artists. This is psychedelia beyond psychedelia, with poetic storytelling and specially-printed, fluorescent pages. Gorgeous and hallucinatory. 3. An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.)

Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons. This Slavery by Scarlett & Sophie Rickard, published by SelfMadeHero The Poet Volumes 1 & 2 by Todd Webb (self-published). Molly and the Bear by Bob and Vicki Scott, published by Simon & Schuster. Wally Mammoth: The Sled Race by Corey R. Tabor & Dalton Webb, published by HarperCollins. Tedward by Josh Pettinger, published by Fantagraphics.

The King’s Warrior by Huahua Zhu, published by Bulgilhan Press. *** (articles)(top) I hate writing best-of lists. Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Glenn Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ... (Image Comics) So damn FUN and extremely DARK with incredible characters, genuine suspense and impeccable pacing and storytelling. The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) A beautiful and raw expression of extremely difficult experiences and emotions. Tyler provides the reader with a TRANSCENDENT experience. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore (Pantheon) An extremely important, well researched and compiled historical account of the History of Black Resistance that is lovingly told with beautiful artwork, moments of humor, ire, genuine feeling, and a whole lot of DEPTH. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees: Rite of Spring by Patrick Horvath (IDW) Disturbing and masterful, this story has got me HOOKED. There Will Be Tears by Charles Burns (Partners and Son) Drawings so insanely beautiful they will both BREAK and MEND your heart simultaneously. The Devil's Grin: Book One by Alex Graham (Fantagraphics) Exceptional writing and character development, Graham builds a STRANGE world we can identify with deeply. Viscere #2: Folk Horror edited by Katie Skelly (Stregasporca) Soothe your inner hedgewitch with this outstanding horror anthology filled with MACABRE tales by fabulous femmes. Orphan and the Five Beasts: Bath of Blood by James Stokoe (Dark Horse Comics) James Stokoe's artwork is PHENOMENAL, this outstanding limited series has great writing and a well developed universe. His take on epic battle scenes and creepy, gooey guts and gore is a pure delight. Saga de Xam by Jean Rollin and Nicholas Devil (Anthology Editions) STUNNING. This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world. Toxic Avenger by Matt Bors and Fred Harper (Ahoy Comics) Matt and Fred EXCEL at continuing the adventures of Lloyd Kaufman’s titular character, THE TOXIC AVENGER. Adventure Time (2025): The Bubbline College Special #1 by Caroline Cash This is so damn CUTE. Gorgeous artwork and coloring, a beautiful coming of age sapphic tale filled with classic Adventure Time capers and lots of chuckles. Skinbreaker by Robert Kirkman and David Finch (Image Comics) JAW-DROPPING artwork and exceptional world building make this a must read series. Moan by Junji Ito (Viz Media) HORRIFYING and delightful, I have yet to ever be disappointed by a Junji Ito book. The Confessional by Paige Hender (Silver Sprocket) GORGEOUS artwork compliments this delightfully wicked period piece about vampires, sinners and wannabe saints. Rats Eyes: a Games and Puzzles activity book (expanded 2025 edition) by Hyena Hell and Josh Bayer (self-published) Two completely unstoppable FORCES OF COMICS NATURE combine their powers to bring you a love letter to BLACK FLAG in the form of a puzzles and games book that is so damn fun, it'll completely melt ur eyeballs. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy. HONORABLE MENTION Black Cohosh, Eagle Valiant Brosi (Drawn & Quarterly) Calavera, P.I., Marco Finnegan (Oni Press) Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) Drome, Jesse Lonergan (23rd St.) Gaza in My Phone, Mazen Kerbaj (OR Books) The Giant: Orson Welles, the Artist and the Shadow, Youssef Daoudi (23rd St.) Holy Lacrimony, Michael DeForge (Drawn & Quarterly) In the End We All Die, Tobias Aeschbacher [Andrew Shields, translator] (Helvetiq) John Muir: To the Heart of Solitude, Lomig (NBM Publishing) Lovers and Haters, Gilbert Hernandez (Fantagraphics) The Magnificent Adventure, Milo Manara (Fantagraphics) The Murder Next Door: A Graphic Memoir, Hugh D'Andrade (Street Noise Books) The Pit, Erik Kriek (Living the Line) Simplicity: A Novel, Mattie Lubchansky (Pantheon Books) World within the World: The Collected Short Comix 2010-2022, Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2024 was a terrific year for the medium, with new releases by greats like Olivier Schrauwen, Rick Altergott, Maurice Vellekoop, Emil Ferris, Peter Bagge, Dash Shaw, and many others (not to mention a bumper crop of books by Charles Burns). Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1. Monsieur Chouette, David B, L'Association This is a tale about the nature of fear, the imagination and the afterlife. It's also the best thing David B has done since Epileptic. BUT: After 35 years, the trailblazing L'Association risks extinction due to production/transport costs, the squeeze on indie bookstores and the huge amount of well-publicized competition from big BD publishers. I urge you to join as a member (benefits include a discount their on their 800+ work catalogue, which gave you Epileptic, Persepolis and Emmanuel Guibert's Alan's War). Or just make a small contribution here. 2. Béla sans monde, Simon Roussin, Editions 2042 Roussin is one of today's most original artists. This is psychedelia beyond psychedelia, with poetic storytelling and specially-printed, fluorescent pages. Gorgeous and hallucinatory. 3. An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Full Content:
India's markets are consolidating into duopolies, with two dominant players controlling nearly 90% of sectors like aviation, food delivery, and digital payments.

Title: The €170bn 'resting' in Irish bank accounts

Try from €1.50 / week Try from €1.50 / week €1 in every €7 earned in Ireland is now being saved by households, underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. Irish households are saving money at a rate not seen since the pandemic-induced highs of the early 2020s with recent data showing the savings rate hitting the highest levels since the middle of 2022. However, much of that money languishes in deposit accounts which offer little in the way of returns for customers as inflation erodes its value. Recently released figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows that Irish households are continuing to add to their deposit accounts with the savings rate rising to almost 15% between July and September, up 2% from the previous quarter. The current savings rate is also notably above the average of 13.1% since the beginning of 2023. It said that €1 in €7 is now being saved by households, which is being underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. According to data from the Central Bank of Ireland, as of the end of October, the total value of household deposits stood at €170.3bn marking the first time in the history of the data series that this figure surpassed €170bn - an increase of €2bn compared to September and an increase of €11.3bn in the year to the end of October. Even though all categories had a positive contribution, overnight deposits - which is money largely kept in current accounts - was the main driver, reporting a positive flow of €1.9bn during the month. The CSO said that savings can add to a household's overall wealth in the form of buying new homes, growing bank deposits, pension savings, and paying off debt. Managing director of Cork-based financial planning firm Alpha Wealth Nick Charalambous said the reality is a lot of Irish depositors are “getting next to zero interest” on their savings with inflation eroding its value over time. "Don't leave your money sitting dormant in the banks, the post office, credit unions,” he said. Financial planner with Castle Capital Colum Carroll said inflation is the “real killer” of wealth and investing money, whether it be through a pension or other mechanisms, allows people to plan better for the future. "People often see investments as being risky, but I think the narrative kind of needs to change around that again…Not investing can actually be even more risky. The risk of running out of money, the risk of not having enough money in the future, or losing purchasing power. They're the kind of real risks,” he said. Mr Charalambous said a part of the reason for people keeping money on deposit or in savings is the fear of losing it and maybe a lack of understanding of the options that are out there for people to make their money work harder particularly over the medium to long term. When looking into what to do with all their savings, Mr Charalambous said households should consider the timeframe for when they need the savings as this will dictate the appropriate financial vehicle. In the short-term, which would be three years or less, he says that money should be kept on deposit. "Most of us are now used to using Revolut. With their introduction of savings and deposit rates as well as investment accounts, there are millions upon millions of euros going into those types of savings,” he said, however, there are better returns offered by other non-Irish entities. “Raisin would be my preferred one, and the main reason for that is that they use physical banks. With Raisin you can get a sort of a three month starter rate with Raisin themselves who are triple a rated institution at 3.1% gross, and typically the demand deposit rates with Raisin are in and around 2.15%,” he said. After covering expenses and managing savings for the short-term, Mr Charalambous said people should be prioritising longer-term investments such as a pension. "Unfortunately, we all live in the here and now, and it's very difficult for us to kind of visualize a scenario where we are basically benefiting from building up this very tax efficient investment vehicle, which is a pension,” he said. In the medium term, which would be four years or longer, Mr Charalambous said there are investment options from the likes of Irish Life, Aviva, and Zurich which offer “very broad investment solutions”. Mr Charalambous said all investments should be reviewed at least once a year. Given the growth of Revolut, along with other financial applications, people have become a lot more familiar with investing themselves in stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In these apps, people can choose to manage their own investments with the money being easily accessible should the customer need to make a withdrawal. However, Mr Charalambous warned that the options often offered in these apps are very concentrated and largely dependent on US stock markets. "The Vanguard S&P 500 as an example, is the most common ETF globally, where most people start with and put too much exposure to. But it's a very narrow fund, because it's concentrated purely in the US, solely in 500 companies,” he said, adding that it is largely dependent on the growth of the Magnificent Seven. “Yet we've seen gold has done spectacularly well this year. European equities have typically outperformed the US particularly if you take into account the dollar weakness that we've seen this year.” Growth in the US stock market is heavily concentrated on just a handful of companies nicknamed the Magnificent Seven - Google’s parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - which brings with it a lot of risk particularly if there is a falloff in the tech sector. Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, has seen its stock price surge over the course of the year as tech companies scramble to buy as many of its graphics processing units (GPUs) as possible to put into data centres to power their AI models. Nvidia alone accounts for over 7% of the S&P 500. Mr Charalambous said the Vanguard S&P 500 is a “speculative type of investing” and the risk might be higher than they realise. "People typically wouldn't realize the level of risk that they may be undertaking when they go into a fund like that,” he said. Data from the Central Bank of Ireland shows the market value of Irish resident holdings of securities stood at just under €6 trillion (tn) as of the end of September - an increase of €353m over the quarter. Of this total, Irish pension funds account for €51bn while household investments account for €28.26bn. Listed shares accounted for €2.4tn of the total with the US being the primary destination for Irish resident investment in stocks accounting for 58% of the total value or €1.4tn. In comparison, the Irish stock market only accounts for 2% or €49bn, of the total money Irish investment in stocks. The surge in share valuations in the US stock market is primarily being driven by the Magnificent Seven of which many are heavily investing in AI and its supporting infrastructure, particularly data centres. However, as of yet, there has been little return on this investment for these companies and if the so-called AI bubble bursts, this could spell trouble for Irish investors who have a lot of money wrapped up in US stocks. In terms of households holdings of listed shares, it reached an all-time high during the third quarter reaching €11.5bn. However, this is largely due to the increase in the overall total market value which increased by around €700m in the quarter. During the budget in October, former finance minister Paschal Donohoe announced a reduction in the investment exit tax from 41% to 38% from January 1 which makes it a little cheaper to actually invest in ETFs or other investment products. This rate could come down in the future potentially reaching the 33% rate set for capital gains tax. Due to these tax changes, Mr Carroll said coming into 2026 it’s now “more advantageous” to invest than it has been over the last number of years because of the exit tax coming down. “Hopefully that should come down even more,” he said, adding that even if it came down to 33% it would still be quite high compared to the US and the UK. Capital gains tax is paid at 33% on the profits of the sale or disposal of certain access such as shares in a company or bonds. However, an exit tax is paid on the profit from an investment in a fund - such as an ETF - and is charged at 38%. In addition, under deemed disposal rules, that tax is liable to be paid every eight years regardless of whether the asset is sold or not. Given the lower rate of tax on holding single shares, rather than investing in broad funds, Mr Carroll said these rules do not "promote good investing”. “You get 33% if you hold a single stock which is very risky, versus holding a tiny, tiny percentage of tens of thousands of stocks all around the world, you get taxed heavily on that,” he said. "The best practice is, if you have the money now and you don't need access to it, now is the best time to invest,” he said. "Like long term investing isn't essentially risky, it's more the risk of not having enough money in the future or when you need it. If you don't have enough money to pay for your children's education fund, or you don't have enough money to retire at 65 and you need to continue to work longer than you'd hoped, that's the kind of real risk,” Mr Carroll said.

Title: Ethereum's TVL could skyrocket '10X' in 2026: Sharplink CEO

Time Published: 2025-12-26T23:46:28Z

A surge in stablecoins, tokenized RWAs and growing sovereign wealth fund interest could drive a major increase in Ethereum’s TVL in 2026, Sharplink’s co-CEO said. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) may surge ten-fold in 2026 as adoption expands across multiple use cases and institutional investors, according to Sharplink’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom. Sharplink Gaming is the second-largest public Ethereum treasury company, holding 797,704 ETH (ETH), worth roughly $2.33 billion at the time of publication, according to Ethereum Treasuries data. “The stablecoin market will hit $500B by the end of next year,” Chalom predicted in an X post on Friday, as the total stablecoin market capitalization currently sits at around $308.46 billion. A move to $500 billion would represent an increase of about 62%. With over half of the total stablecoin activity (54%) taking place on Ethereum, such a rise could potentially contribute to an increase in the network’s TVL. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to see significant growth, forecasting the market will reach $300 billion in 2026. “Tokenized assets will 10X in AUM in 2026, going from tokenizing individual funds, stocks, and bonds to full fund complexes,” Chalom said. He pointed to rising interest over the past year from financial services companies including JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock as a major catalyst. An increasing TVL is often seen as a sign of growing interest in the network, which can bolster market sentiment and potentially influence the price of the asset. At the time of publication, Ethereum’s TVL is around $68.20 billion, according to DeFiLlama. However, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said on Tuesday that Ether is unlikely to hit new highs in the coming year, given current conditions for Bitcoin. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $2,924, down 3.12% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. Chalom anticipates Ethereum holdings and tokenization activity by sovereign wealth funds to grow five- to tenfold over the next year. Related: Ethereum in 2026: Glamsterdam and Hegota forks, L1 scaling and more “In 2026 this will amplify meaningfully as competitive dynamics take hold. When no one was willing to touch crypto from this pool of allocators, it was safe to stay sidelined,” Chalom said. Chalom also predicted that onchain AI agents and prediction markets will “go mainstream,” which he said will drive more activity and value to the ecosystem.

Title: Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?
URL: https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-meta-x-a-threat-to-NVDA-or-just-another-deepseek-market-scare/?utm_source=yahoofinance&amp;utm_medium=yahoofinance
Time Published: 2025-12-26T21:45:00Z
Full Content:
On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float. Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.

On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion.

On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence.

Title: Etheruem’s tokenization role takes focus as Tom Lee outlines bullish outlook

Time Published: 2025-12-26T21:15:54Z

Fundstrat’s head of research said institutional tokenization supports a $7,000–$9,000 Ether price in early 2026 and a longer-term case for $20,000. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s growing role in institutional finance took center stage on CNBC’s Power Lunch this week, when Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Ether could climb to $7,000–$9,000 by early 2026 as Wall Street accelerates efforts to tokenize assets and move financial activity onchain. Lee said Ether’s (ETH) investment case is increasingly tied to its use as financial infrastructure, as Wall Street experiments with onchain settlement and tokenized securities. “Wall Street wants to tokenize everything,” Lee said, pointing to initiatives at Robinhood and BlackRock. The shift, he said, could bring efficiencies to traditional finance while anchoring real-world use cases on Ether. He added that Ether could eventually reach $20,000 as adoption deepens. He was also bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), calling it a “genuine store of value” and saying a move to $200,000 next year “makes a lot of sense,” framing its recent underperformance versus gold as temporary. Lee is also chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading Ether-focused treasury company that has reported holdings of 4,066,062 ETH, according to CoinGecko data. Related: 70% of Ether positions are 'long' as whale accumulation tightens ETH supply Tokenized real-world assets, traditional financial instruments and physical assets represented onchain have expanded rapidly this year, with total market value rising to about $18.9 billion, up from roughly $5.6 billion at the start of 2025. According to data from RWA.xyz, US Treasury debt is the largest tokenized asset class at around $8.5 billion, followed by commodities at about $3.4 billion. Ethereum currently accounts for the majority of tokenized RWA value across public blockchains. As of late December 2025, the network hosts more than $12 billion in tokenized assets, well ahead of alternatives such as BNB Chain, Solana and Arbitrum. Ethereum also leads stablecoin issuance, with roughly $170 billion in stablecoins issued on the network, reinforcing its role as the primary settlement layer for dollar-denominated activity onchain. Institutional interest in tokenized RWAs continued to build in December, when the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) said it plans to tokenize a portion of US Treasury securities held at its Depository Trust Company subsidiary on the Canton Network. DTCC operates post-trade infrastructure for US securities markets, with its subsidiaries processing about $3.7 quadrillion in securities transactions last year.

Title: Expert Alleges Bitcoin Under Siege Again, ETFs And BlackRock Suspected
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-under-siege-etfs-and-blackrock-suspected/
Time Published: 2025-12-26T19:52:41Z
Full Content:
The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) volatility has led to significant liquidations, prompting renewed suspicions of market manipulation among experts. A detailed analysis by market expert NoLimit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) reveals that, at the time of the stock market opening, BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT transferred hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin into Coinbase Prime wallets. This timing and location indicate a pattern that institutions often follow when selling their assets. As explained, these coins are not sent to Coinbase Prime merely to remain inactive; they are typically directed there for sale or liquidity management purposes. NoLimit asserts that when a major player like BlackRock needs to liquidate assets or meet redemption demands, the price of Bitcoin reacts rapidly. He suggests that this situation reflects a combination of factors: selling related to ETFs taking place during low liquidity, inventory management in anticipation of upcoming volatility, and risk reduction in light of a significant derivatives event. Compounding these concerns, technical analyst OxNobler highlighted further developments that contributed to the recent downturn, detailing significant sell-offs by various trading platforms. In a rapid succession of transactions, Binance reportedly sold 10,155 BTC, Wintermute let go of 5,354 BTC, Coinbase disposed of 10,113 BTC, BlackRock sold 4,945 BTC, and Kraken moved 4,630 BTC. Collectively, these actions amounted to over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin sold within a mere 30 minutes, raising suspicions of coordinated market manipulation. According to analysts from Bull Theory, the situation has taken a dire turn, with Bitcoin plummeting by $2,300 and liquidating $66 million in long positions in just 45 minutes. Against this backdrop, $60 billion has been wiped from the crypto market without any negative news triggering such a drastic shift. This scenario has led them to assert that manipulation continues to be a significant concern within the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $87,340, down slightly more than 30% from its all-time highs set earlier in October.

Title: Meta Platforms Might Be the Biggest Bargain in Big Tech
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/26/meta-platforms-might-be-the-biggest-bargain-in-big-tech/
Time Published: 2025-12-26T18:05:14Z

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © nextheprime / Shutterstock.com Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) certainly stands out as one of the bigger “deals” to be had in big tech for those looking to play the value side of the AI trade. Undoubtedly, when it comes to the Magnificent Seven, investors might wish to be more selective with which members of the famed group they buy going into the new year. Whether that’s due to the variance in performance between the individual names, the different slates of expectations set ahead of them, or their potential to make up ground in this AI race, there are reasons to get pickier when it comes to the most magnificent names atop this market. Since it feels unlikely that the non-stop chatter about stretched stock valuations, bubbles, and all the doubts that AI can live up to its potential will pull back in the new year, investors might need to increase their tolerance for turbulence going into the new year, especially with the companies that have been spending far more than your average investor might be comfortable with. At this juncture, the higher the AI spending bar, the higher the expectations bar is likely to be in the new year, and for companies like Meta Platforms, it seems like the shares are looking relatively cheap for a reason. But what happens if there are decent returns that lie just a bit further down the road that investors and analysts can’t yet see? In such a case, shares of Meta Platforms may very well be in for more consolidation or even downside before investors come to the realization that its AI strategy is paying off, perhaps many times over. Some upbeat analysts over at Morgan Stanley seem to think that the new year could be incredibly kind to the social-media juggernaut. Notably, they see revenue re-acceleration at the hands of stronger ad demand as well as improved performance of ads at the hands of AI. Add Reels and WhatsApp business messaging momentum into the equation, and it certainly feels like 2026 will see enough of an AI return to soothe the fears of the rising tide of AI spend. Another bull, Colin Sebastian, over at Baird, also thinks 2026 could be a good year for Meta Platforms shares. He thinks new AI models (think closed-source Avocado and Mango models, as Meta Platforms moves on from its open-source LLaMA model) might help push the name to $815 per share. Undoubtedly, the sudden and surprising shift from open-source to closed-source models might be a head-scratcher for some. Either way, it seems to be the right way to go, especially given industry trends. I think Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg can deliver more than a few surprises in the new year, as the company potentially looks to give investors what they want over the near- to medium-term while also ensuring enough is spent on the long-term opportunity at hand. On the one hand, some of the bears see the firm as spending a bit too much on AI efforts. On the other hand, some skeptics might see Meta Platforms as “lagging” in the AI race. Undoubtedly, there’s room to catch up if Meta AI is to catch up to the likes of the current leaders. Either way, it’s just too easy to be bearish on the stock right here. And that’s why the stage might be set for a big rally that helps shares catch up to the rest of the Mag Seven after a rough, but still positive (shares up 11% year to date) year. At the time of this writing, Meta Platforms’ shares are going for 22.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E).

Title: Christmas Wrap: Retailers Relieved After Achieving Middling Gains

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Apparel performed especially strongly this holiday and there's some optimism that 2026 might be OK for the retail business. Senior Editor, Retail Between price hikes due to tariffs and inflation, sagging consumer confidence, and shoppers becoming choosier than ever, retailers had plenty to overcome this holiday season. But they managed to — and should emerge with sales 3 to 4 percent above last year’s holiday season, meeting or slightly surpassed their plans, according to commentary from about two dozen retailers, shopping center executives, analysts, and market researchers. How did they do it? Retailers offered values that were appealing and apparent. Consumers were willing to absorb tariff-related price increases, generally under 10 percent on fashion. And the weather was conducive to Americans getting out to shop, except where there was flooding in the Pacific Northwest and storms in the Midwest. California was battered with flooding rains on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and the Northeast got hit with a major snowstorm late Friday into Saturday. These likely reduced store visits for returns and shopping with gift cards and had some impact on business, but probably didn’t dramatically alter the outcome.

Electronics also fared well, particularly video games. On the other hand, sales of home goods were on the soft side. Visa projected holiday spending (Nov. 1 to Dec. 31) in the U.S. will be up 4.2 percent year-over-year, led by sales of electronics. Mastercard forecasts a 3.9 percent year-over-year gain, with apparel the top category, generating a 7.8 percent sales increase. Those estimates fall in line with the National Retail Federation’s prediction of 3.7 to 4.2 percent holiday sales gains, and total U.S. holiday sales eclipsing $1 trillion for the first time. A clearer picture of how the 2025 season played out with sales and profits will emerge when retailers issue their fourth-quarter results in February and March. “This was a decent season, not great, but a good one,” said Jim von Maur, president and fourth-generation leader of the Davenport, Iowa-based Von Maur Department Stores. “In the Midwest we had horrific storms almost every weekend, but we’ve been catching up, and we’ll end the season in the 3 percent range. Men’s has been really strong. Cosmetics not as much. Fragrance has been good. Children’s has been very good.” Among the bestselling brands cited by von Maur were Skims, Uggs, Peter Millar, Vineyard Vines, Spanx, Hoka, and Cloud 9. “I think we are going to have strong business right after Christmas,” von Maur added. “People will continue to shop. I’m optimistic about that, but you never know about returns. People will be out shopping for deals. Our competitors seem to be promotional. We were restrained. We sold a lot at full-price and did not see [consumer] resistance to that.” “The Christmas selling season has been better than we anticipated,” said Stephen Yalof, president and chief executive officer of Tanger. “On Super Saturday, we saw sales levels in stores that rivaled Black Friday; in some cases there were even steeper levels. We saw stores taking half off everything, stacking discounts on top of discounts, giving gifts with purchase, even some door busters, but the promotions were planned for sure. I don’t think there was any desperation.” Regarding post-Christmas returns and shopping, Tanger was probably less impacted by the inclement weather since most of its 38 outlet centers and three open-air lifestyle centers are in warmer climates. Yalof listed Nike, Under Armour and Adidas in athletic apparel and footwear; Michael Kors, Coach and Tory Burch in accessories; Pandora and Kay in jewelry, and Gap and Old Navy in apparel as among the busiest destinations. “The season was good early on and good late and the lull in the middle lasted a little longer than we expected, so the shopping got bigger very late,” said one top retail executive, who said the season has been OK. Regarding the snow and rains post Christmas, “I don’t think that should change things dramatically.” One specialty retail executive at a company that also wholesales said, “We feel really fortunate. There could have been this perfect storm between tariffs, the price of gold going up at least 50 percent to $4,500, and the situation with Saks Global,” which hasn’t been paying vendors and seems headed for bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the source said, “Gold has been selling very strong.” Following an “amazing Black Friday,” business continued to churn throughout the holiday season at Brooks Brothers, according to CEO Ken Ohashi. “We’ll end the month in a good place,” he said. “We had a tremendous sportswear year,” he said, led by sweaters, knitwear and fashion items in seasonal colors and patterns. “A lot of our business is replenishment items, like our white button-down shirts and Golden Fleece blazers, but the disproportionate strength of our fashion offering tells me the customer is looking for newness,” he said. Ohashi said Brooks Brothers notched a strong number of new customers this year purchasing at full price. “Our consumer is pretty resilient and our dollars per transaction have been up all year,” he said.Bob Mitchell, CEO of Mitchells Stores, said the company’s 10 stores had “another record holiday season. To keep putting increases on every year is great. The formula is working — clients are just happy to be in a multibrand environment with high service.” Although Mitchells and Richards on the East Coast led the way, Wilkes Bashford stores in California, including the unit in Palo Alto that was up against a strong opening last year, also performed well. Marios stores in Seattle and Portland, Ore., “came on strong at the end,” Mitchell said, and the latest addition, Stanley Korshak in Dallas, also had a good season. For most of the company, traffic slowed at the end, Mitchell said, particularly in menswear, but overall, the business posted high-single-digit gains for the season. In men’s, top performers included luxury sweaters, outerwear and expensive casual pants from Marco Pescarolo. Zegna was the most popular brand along with Kiton, Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana. In women’s, “jewelry was the big winner,” along with expensive outerwear that “helped make up for the lighter traffic,” Mitchell said.“It was busy the last few days before Christmas, which caught me a little by surprise,” said Ken Giddon, president of Rothmans, which operates men’s stores in New York City and the nearby Westchester County. “I’m surprised at the tenacity of the consumer. There was a crazy amount of gift giving. Our suburban stores were a little light on merchandise because of the big late push. I guess we did a good job picking the right things.” Giddon said the strongest sellers included Eleventy and Peter Millar, a brand that ran out of stock early, and an indicator of the strength of the quarter-zip sweater trend. “We’re selling those to the younger guys as well as their dads.” Raffi sweaters, Barbour socks and Brax pants were also strong sellers. “As the weather changes, we get a big push in outerwear and we also benefit from kids coming home from college and shopping for suits,” Giddon said. Heather Kaminetsky, CEO of Net-a-porter, said in a statement, “This holiday season we’ve seen our customer buy gifts for others, but also for herself — with peaks in fine jewelry from David Morris and Jessica McCormack, cozy fashion pieces from Loewe and Khaite and accessories from The Row.” One retail CEO, who requested anonymity, said, “A lot of [retailers] have taken their units down and are riding on higher average unit retail prices. There’s less inventory out there. I think after last April, a lot of people scrambled to pull down some things because the cost of inventory went up, and so you really had to pick your shots. We took our assortment down. It was effective for us. It’s paying off in margin, in a year where margin has been hit hard with the increased cost of tariffs.” Asked if markdowns were steeper this year compared to 2024, the retailer said, “I don’t think the magnitude increased any. Q4 is the most promotional quarter. We all know that. But it’s also, for many of us, the lowest margin quarter, right? It’s a lot of volume, but it’s also end of year, end of season, and given the inflated cost basis, we’ve all been very careful about managing our inventory so it doesn’t dilute our margins too much. No one wants the inventory after the holiday.” “I’m hearing from retailers that Black Friday and Super Saturday were both good,” said John Neutzling, chief operating officer of Miller Capital Advisors. “They both showed increases over last year. However, what was more interesting is that the sales across the weeks of Black Friday and Super Saturday were better than last year also. So that suggests shoppers were showing up all week long.” The privately held Skokie, Ill.-based Miller Capital has 17 properties in its portfolio including large, high-profile shopping centers like Ala Moana in Honolulu, Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona and the Houston Galleria. “Some of the legacy brands, the ones that have been around for a while, seem to now appeal to Gen Z and even Gen Alpha. The Gap in particular has found a really good business plan, and has had multiple quarters of sales growth,” said Neutzling. John Harmon, a technology and equity analyst at Coresight, characterized the season as “just on track,” but could wind up being a bit better than 3 to 3.5 percent. Noting how people were shopping early, Harmon said October seemed “pretty calm, business really picked up in November, and 34.7 percent of consumers in the U.S. were done shopping by Dec. 15.” Regarding promotions, “It seemed pretty normal and largely planned.” Harmon listed Amazon, Walmart and Target as the top-performing retailers during the season, though Walmart was largely fueled by its superior food offering; Amazon by its popularity, speedy deliveries and low prices, and Target apparently experienced a pickup after several sluggish seasons. He also cited Dollar Tree, TJ Maxx, Dollar General, Costco and Kohl’s as having a good season. With holiday shopping spreading out over a longer period, Black Friday was less busy this year, with 46.8 percent of consumers shopping, versus 63.8 percent last year. Doorbusters were limited, and the Black Friday crowds of yesteryear were gone. “The season ended on a high note,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. “Super Saturday and the Sunday and Monday after were very strong days for retailers, in terms of foot traffic and buying. It’s also been an excellent year for apparel, which is well over 7 percent ahead. Apparel was a laggard for many years. But people have been out spending, perceptions of the economy are improving, and interest rates ticked down. The impact of tariffs has been overblown. We think that will all settle out. “The real thing that added money for spending was this dramatic drop in gasoline prices. We went into the season forecasting 4 to 4.6 percent sales growth. It might get up to 5 percent-plus” overall for the retail sector. Johnson, like other observers, cited Walmart, Costco, Amazon and off-price players as performing well this season. “It’s been a relatively benign promotional season, though there are always a few outliers, most retailers were 25 to 40 percent off, though Gap offered 40 percent off everything” in late December, he said. Industrywide, “Inventories were pretty much in balance, as the two months unfolded we saw people really beginning to spend.” The athleisure sector, including Vuori, Beyond Yoga and Free People Movement, were exceptionally strong, and retailers specializing in health and personal care had a good season. Demand for consumer electronics picked up, but mostly with video games. Outdoor sporting goods had just “a pretty good season.” Returns were in full swing starting Friday, as were post-Christmas sales, so Americans took the opportunity to exchange gifts for credit or take advantage of discounted merchandise. The combination of returning gifts and taking advantage of deepening discounts will continue for weeks, as will redeeming gift cards. For the holiday season, about 20 percent of apparel sold will be returned, according to Marcus Shen, CEO of B-stock, a business-to-business platform helping retailers unload returns and excess merchandise to off-pricers, jobbers and resale stores. The vast majority of apparel, he believes, will be back on the shelves and hangers. “Consumer electronics and some other categories outside of apparel are probably closer to the 10 to 15 percent range. It varies by brand and category.” Overall, he expects return rates to be a slightly above last year’s, mirroring how sales perform. While business has been so far so good, the Friday and weekend after Christmas brought significant weather volatility, impacting what’s normally a busy day in stores for returns and redeeming gift cards. In the Pacific Northwest, “Heavy precipitation and high winds are expected to persist through New Year’s Day,” Evan Gold, executive vice president of global partnership and alliances at Planalytics, which quantifies how weather impacts businesses, wrote in a report. “Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, Seattle and Portland are among the major markets to expect heavy precipitation, including 3-plus inches of rain over the coming days. This will bring flooding conditions and keep soils saturated. In addition, high winds are expected from Northern California into the Pacific Northwest, posing threats for power outages and causing travel disruptions.” Gold indicated that sales on the West Coast of need-based categories will spike, including wiper blades, rainwear and pumps. Major population centers, including New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore and Detroit, got hit with snow and ice over the weekend. New York City got over 4 inches of snow, its most in four years. Another storm, mainly rain with some ice, was expected to hit the Northeast late Sunday afternoon into early Monday morning. Gold wrote before the Saturday storm that it was likely to drive demand for need-based categories, including ice melt, snow shovels, scrapers, heaters and more, Gold wrote. However, unlike the days preceding Christmas, when consumers must get to the stores for last-minute gifts, shoppers could wait out the bad post-Christmas weather hitting the East Coast and California because stores typically allow 30 to 90 days to make returns and gift cards are generally good for years. Looking ahead to 2026, there will be a wave of tax refunds due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and he has proposed providing a onetime, $2,000 tariff rebate to Americans to offset some of the impact of tariffs and the anxiety over the economy to stimulate spending. Also, Trump has proposed $1,176 “warrior dividends” to military personnel. “From what we understand from the customer, there is enthusiasm” about the economic stimulus from the government, Yalof observed. “There is a lot money in the marketplace.” Yalof also said retailers he’s had contact with are “very optimistic” about 2026. “Retailers have not slowed down growth, from a leasing perspective. We’re doing a lot of brick-and-mortar deals.” Ohashi at Brooks Brothers said he believes the skies will be bright “as long as we continue to offer newness.” While half of the company’s stores are in the Northeast, he said Brooks will be focusing more on its warm-weather doors next year, even opening two stores in Puerto Rico in 2026. Stores in warmer climates move into spring more quickly, providing a quicker read on the season. Mitchell said he’s “a little cautious, especially in men’s where traffic slowed the last two weeks, but I’m still positive.” Giddon at Rothmans said he’s optimistic about 2026, and that the final days before Christmas “surprised us because we felt the economy wasn’t that strong. But people are obviously more optimistic so we’ll have to measure our projections slightly upward for 2026.” RetailNext tracks shopper traffic at hundreds of retailers outfitted with tens of thousands of RetailNext traffic counters. “For the season overall, traffic was down 6.5 percent from November through Super Saturday,” said Joe Shasteen, global manager, advanced analytics, Retail Next. Stores were getting fewer visits, but conversion rates held up. “The shopping this year was more intentional and less about browsing,” Shasteen said, adding that retailers made up shortfalls in their stores with their e-commerce businesses, which were up in the high single digits. “Holiday sales are not a reliable predictor, but we see a 5 percent-plus gain possibly repeated in the first quarter of 2026. It may even jump ahead of that, if we see a turn in the housing market,” said Johnson. “There are a couple of signs of that happening, but it’s not quite there yet. Housing has historically been a big booster to growth. If interest rates come down, we may yet see not just above 5, but 6 percent by the back half.” “All the indicators show we are going to have some positive business going into 2026,” Von Maur said. “The economy is still strong, unemployment is low, tariffs got the prices up but customers aren’t holding back.” With tariffs, “The worst is behind us.” “The holiday season has so far been a success for retailers,” Stephanie Cegielski, vice president, research and public relations, ICSC, said on Tuesday. “Consumers are still price-sensitive, but most continued to shop in the final days leading up to Christmas….One thing is clear: Despite their economic concerns, consumers are still willing to spend on memorable experiences, entertainment and gifts at the right price. They may be prioritizing value, but the retailers that are winning this holiday season will look beyond price to connect with consumers and stay on their radars into 2026 and beyond.” — With contributions from Jean E.

Instead, most of the biggest headlines attached to the financial services organization were irrelevant to trading screens, most notably the conclusion to its years-long battle with the SEC, major acquisitions to propel its future growth, and the launch of a billion-dollar stablecoin product—RLUSD. Below we’ll look back at the biggest highlights for XRP and Ripple in 2025. More than four years after it began, the legal dispute between Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially came to a close in August. The landmark case, which investigated whether or not sales of XRP violated securities laws, extended back to December 2020. In 2023, a partial ruling favored Ripple Labs, but appeals and counter-appeals extended the saga into 2025. However, with the election of President Donald Trump and a crypto-friendlier regulatory administration, the pair opted to find a jointly negotiated resolution in early 2025. That negotiated resolution was later denied by a U.S. district judge, and then by the courts, so eventually the pair agreed to drop their respective appeals—ending the affair for good and cementing the 2023 ruling in Ripple’s favor as a precedent for future crypto classifications. Prior to 2025, XRP had last traded above $3.00 in 2018. Seven years later, and around a month before the conclusion to Ripple Labs’ yearslong legal battle with the SEC, the Ripple-linked XRP made a new all-time high of $3.65, according to data from CoinGecko, surging beyond its previous high mark of $3.40 from 2018. That made XRP the third-largest crypto asset by market capitalization at the time, trailing just Bitcoin and Ethereum. With regulatory scrutiny waning, analysts at the time told Decrypt that investors “believed in Ripple's vision for a regulatory-compliant blockchain for institutions.” Though its rapid rise placed the token in a range it had not seen since 2018, investment firms like Standard Chartered maintained even higher end-of-year price targets for XRP during the summer—expecting a move to $5.50 by the end of year. That mark seems unlikely now though, despite the acceleration of the tokenization trend that Standard Chartered highlighted as a potential catalyst for the price of XRP. XRP, now the fourth-largest asset by market capitalization, was changing hands at $1.90 as of December 15, around 48% off its July all-time high. After the approval and ensuing success of ETFs for crypto majors Bitcoin and Ethereum, both investors and fund issuers were eager to get altcoin ETFs—like those for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—to market. As a result, applications for altcoin ETFs flooded the SEC, and by June, expert opinions predicted the likelihood of their approvals as a “near lock” for 2025. Those opinions were further validated in September when the SEC cleared a path to approval for new ETFs by signing off on new generic listing standards. Around that time, Rex Shares and Osprey Funds got their joint XRP ETF to market—an Act 40 ETF that follows different listing standards than other crypto ETFs. Demand for the product was shown immediately, grabbing $38 million in day one volume, good enough to mark the year’s biggest debut up until that point. Shortly thereafter, though, more traditional spot ETF products from Canary Capital, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton hit the market. In December, leveraged products hit the market as well, allowing investors to double their exposure to XRP’s gains. Since their launch, the spot ETFs have generated nearly $1 billion in net inflows without a single day of outflows, according to data from CoinGlass, as of December 15. XRP eclipsed a major milestone in 2025, but so did Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD. First launched in December 2024, the dollar-backed stablecoin frontran the growing trend of stablecoin products from other financial giants like Western Union and JP Morgan, and the passing of the GENIUS Act, which provided regulatory clarity on the issuance and trading of the fiat-backed tokens. In the year since its launch, functionality for RLUSD has expanded. In September it was added to Securitize’s tokenization platform, a BlackRock-backed platform that now allows users to exchange shares of tokenized money market funds for RLUSD. In December the firm earned approval to broaden payment services, including RLUSD, in Singapore as well. It's being used for credit card settlements too, thanks to a partnership with Mastercard and WebBank, the issuer of crypto exchange Gemini’s credit card products. While RLUSD is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, Ripple applied for a National Bank Charter in July, following the lead of USDC issuer Circle, as it aims to become the “benchmark for trust” in the stablecoin market. And it received conditional approval in December, alongside other stablecoin issuers. At the time of writing, the stablecoin has reached a $1.3 billion market cap, making it the 11th largest stablecoin in less than a year since its launch, according to data from DefiLlama. Though closely linked to XRP, Ripple is much larger and more expansive than a single crypto token, and its footprint grew considerably throughout 2025 thanks to major acquisitions. In April, the firm forked over $1.25 billion to acquire primer brokerage Hidden Road as it aimed to better serve institutional clients on a larger scale. It then spent another $1 billion to acquire treasury asset management firm GTreasury in October, in a play that will reduce friction and costs associated with legacy financial systems, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. It surrounded that acquisition with two others, paying $200 million to add Toronto-based stablecoin platform Rail, and an undisclosed amount on wallet-as-a-service provider Palisade. All told, Ripple's acquisitions in 2025 maintain a similar theme, improving payment efficiencies while expanding its financial services offerings. Those moves helped the firm notch a $500 million investment in November, valuing it at $40 billion and cementing its place among the current and future leaders of the crypto industry. "This investment isn’t just validation of Ripple’s growth strategy and business built on the foundation of XRP, but also a clear bet on what the future of crypto will look like," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. "I’m very proud of what we’ve built, and all that’s to come."

In a move that reshapes the battlefield of artificial intelligence hardware, chip giant Nvidia has strategically deployed a massive $20 billion to secure the technology and brains behind a key startup, Groq. This deal, structured as a licensing agreement and talent acquisition, represents Nvidia's largest such transaction ever and is a direct response to rising competition, particularly from Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs). For those watching the high-stakes race for AI inference supremacy, this is a clear signal that the arms race is accelerating, with Nvidia pulling out its checkbook to maintain its edge. The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets. This complex structure is widely seen as a tactic to navigate intense antitrust scrutiny. Groq will continue to operate independently, at least in name, with its finance chief Simon Edwards becoming the new CEO. Its cloud service, GroqCloud, will also continue operating. As Huang noted, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groqâs IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company." This "acqui-hire plus licensing" model has become a common playbook for Big Tech. Similar deals have been executed by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia itself earlier this year. The approach allows giants to rapidly absorb innovative technology and top-tier talent without triggering the same level of regulatory review as a traditional acquisition. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon observed, "Antitrust would seem to be be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive." The Google factor and inference wars The strategic impetus for this massive expenditure is clear. Nvidia, while dominant in chips for training AI models, faces a growing challenge in the inference market, where trained models deliver answers to user queries. Google's custom TPUs have gained significant momentum here, offering an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Groq's specialty is its "language processing unit" chips, designed specifically for fast, efficient inference. By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months. This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount. Nvidia's historic $20 billion deal is not just a purchase of technology; it is an investment in maintaining sovereignty over the future of computation itself. As custom chips from tech giants and well-funded startups emerge, this move proves that even the market leader cannot afford to simply innovate; it must also strategically assimilate.

Title: A 'jobless boom' is shaping up to be the story of the 2026 economy

The US economy continues to surprise on the upside — except when it comes to jobs. Hot growth, as seen in this week's GDP report, typically corresponds to stronger hiring and personal earnings, which then enable consumers to continue spending. However, this year, the trend has been the opposite. Spending is driving the economy, but the job market is stuck in a "Great Freeze." As KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote on Tuesday, "Growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled." It's shaping up to be the story of 2026. The US has found itself in what some are calling a "jobless boom." Money is flowing in and out of the economy at a healthy clip, but it's not going toward creating a new job for you. Instead, all eyes are on artificial intelligence, investment in which drove much of the year's economic growth, along with still-strong consumer spending. The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and "do more with less" has been the mantra of the year. "Firms are doing more with fewer workers," Swonk wrote. "Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels more in line with demand. Others are offsetting the squeeze on profit margins due to tariffs with layoffs and hiring freezes." Economists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts. Business Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt "impossible," and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life. In addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread. This suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty. The tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow. Dozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job. In his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for "ROI for AI." "I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects," he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year. If that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market. Although it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the "Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead." Still, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains. Jump to

Dear reader, as 2025, a year of global tumult and volatility, rolls by, Mint's reporters and columnists look around the corner on what is coming in 2026—to help you know what to expect and prepare for it. Tell us what you think at feedback@livemint.com. The Chinese zodiac predicts that 2026 will be the Year of the Fire Horse, symbolizing bold decisions, ambition and sharply moving away from the strategic thinking that was 2025, the Year of the Wood Snake. For both the employer and the employee in India Inc, there will be three prominent trends, says experts. The spotlight will shift to smaller cities and towns as companies look for the right talent and metros lose their lure. The second change will be the dominant role that the gig workforce will play. Thirdly, the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) will remain an integral aspect of the workplace in the coming year with concerns on how to upskill employees without letting go of the high performers. About 18 months ago, recruitment firm CIEL HR opened a hiring hub in Patna where 25 recruiters scout for talent from neighbouring Chhattisgarh and Odisha states and the smaller towns of Bihar. The aim was to cater to the hiring needs of retail, financial services, consumer goods, and manufacturing clients. A similar hub was created earlier in Mysuru in Karnataka as well to tap into IT talent. “The demand from smaller towns will grow because the total cost of hiring and retaining an employee is 5-10% lower in the longer run for companies as those who migrate can be held onto for a longer period than those who are from the larger metros with their offices and homes in the same city,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, managing director and chief executive officer of CIEL HR. The total cost of hiring denotes the overall financial implications of an employee during one's tenure. In this case, it will include investments in upskilling the employee and how their productivity impacts the firm. Mishra pointed out that companies have started employing a blended workforce where a major chunk will be from the same city, 20-25% from nearby towns and the rest from other states. This is largely in the case of temporary staffing, where the employee works at the client's site but will be on the payrolls of the vendor. Over the past couple of years, staffing firms found it difficult to get workers for the peak sale period (August-December) as the workforce demanded higher wages for relocation to the larger cities. A similar challenge will continue in the coming year. Cost pressures on companies will force more gig hiring across the skillset spectrum. Until now, the spurt in gig hiring would come on the back of festive season recruitment, but with the implementation of the labour codes, the benefits for gig workers are cemented. Online food delivery, e-commerce and quick-commerce companies will now have to allocate up to 2% of their annual turnover for the welfare of gig and platform workers. In November, the ministry of labour and employment announced that with the new reforms, all workers would get benefits such as retirement savings via provident fund, coverage under the Employees' State Insurance Corporation, other insurance and social security benefits. Therefore, there will be a larger number of the informal workforce aiming to enter the gig economy. While on a vendor's payroll, gig workers take up short-term projects that could be for a few hours or days and they can work across platforms. Dark stores, retail and logistics are some of the segments that hire gig workers on a large scale. The country’s gig workforce is projected to grow from 10 million in 2024-25 to 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to a Press Information Bureau note on 30 August. "Gig will continue to grow in scale as more people will be eager to join this workforce after new labour codes giving them the social security cover along with blue collar and even white-collar gig roles will scale up," said Lohit Bhatia, CEO-designate for Quess Corp. Blue-collared workers are typically employed in the automotive and manufacturing sector while white-collared find a job in services. In 2025, companies including Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta retrenched employees, citing AI. Companies are in a flux as they scamper to upskill employees on the latest in technology. They are hiring candidates who have the prowess on AI and at the same time, letting go of those who are in the bottom rung of the skillsets. There is a stress that has built up across industries and will play out in the coming year as well. "I do not expect AI’s impact on workplaces to stabilize or 'calm down' after the layoffs we saw in 2025. The 2025 layoffs were not only about cost-cutting – they were about restructuring work around AI systems. In 2026, in my view, that process will deepen," said Rohini Lakshane, a technologist and researcher. Lakshane said companies will have to take note of how they inform and discuss with their workforce the changes in profiles because of AI. “Jobs will not vanish in waves, but they will be hollowed out, with fewer people doing more work, assisted and monitored by AI. Tasks within roles will be automated, recombined or shifted. If that is done without clear communication to workers, it creates insecurity even when employment technically continues," Lakshane said. With increased automation, the pressure on employees will go up as well. "Workers who can design, audit or manage AI systems will remain in demand. For highly skilled professionals, especially in technology and analytics, 2026 will look calmer on the surface, but expectations might rise sharply. Fewer people doing more work, assisted by AI tools, with thinner margins for error," said Lakshane. Ironically, India Inc is one of the swiftest to adopt AI in its teams. According to an EY report covering 50 employers and 800 employees, about 62% use GenAI at work regularly, whereas 90% of the employers and 86% of the employees believe that AI impacts productivity positively. The study noted that 75% of the employees and 72% of the employers believe that GenAI enhances decision making, 82% of the employees and 92% of the employers believe it positively impacts the quality of work.
