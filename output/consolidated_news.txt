What is driving the recent surge in Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin’s price? After facing weeks of uncertainty, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are once again gaining momentum. Despite September’s bearish reputation for BTC, both the cryptocurrency and its associated ETFs have defied expectations with a trend reversal. As of the most recent data on the 26th of September, total inflows for all Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive $365.7 million. Leading the charge was Ark’s ARKB with $113.8 million, followed by Blackrock’s IBT at $93.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded $74 million, while Bitwise’s BITB sits at $50.4 million. VanEck’s HODL, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin’s EZBC also contributed inflows of $22.1 million, $6.5 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Although two more smaller ETFs showed modest inflows below $5 million, the overall surge underscores the renewed investor confidence in BTC ETFs. Notably, on the 25th of September, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, witnessed an extraordinary surge of $184.4 million in inflows for its spot Bitcoin ETF, making it the highest single-day inflow of the month for any fund. This spike comes amid growing market speculation, potentially influenced by developments in Asia. For those unaware, Chinese stocks rallied following reports that the Chinese government may inject up to ¥1 trillion($142 billion) into its major state banks, aimed at boosting an economy that has faced challenges recently. Earlier in the week, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) took easing measures by cutting the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points and lowering the seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. These actions have seemingly fueled optimism, which may be playing a role in the inflows seen in global markets, including Bitcoin ETFs. Remarking on the matter, Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, said, Source: Ki Young Ju/X He further added, “The U.S. is regaining dominance in #Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand. Only known entities are included.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Meanwhile, on the price front, BTC’s price action has shown remarkable resilience. After struggling to break past the $60,000 barrier for days, the leading cryptocurrency surged, reaching $65,642. This marked a 2.89% gain in the last 24 hours. As the month draws to a close, Bitcoin has exhibited a strong bullish trend with an impressive monthly rise of 10.98%, signaling sustained upward momentum in the market.

"We now have a Labour government whose number one priority is wealth creation," U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive broadcast interview Thursday. "We are a Labour party that is proud to say we are pro business just as much as we are pro worker." In July, Starmer became the first leader from the center-left Labour party to win a U.K. national election since Tony Blair — ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Since being elected, he has said his top priority is economic stability. During his visit to New York City amid the United Nations General Assembly, Starmer met with business leaders including Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and Blackstone President Jonathan Gray. This week, Blackstone committed to investing $13 billion to build a data center in the northeast of England. The investment aims to create 4,000 jobs and lead to one of the largest data centers in Europe to power the surging demand for artificial intelligence. "It's a big signal of confidence," Starmer told Sorkin about the deal. "It's also in the northeast of England, which matters to us, because I want economic drive outside of London." Starmer said the industries in particular he's working to attract investment in include renewables, artificial intelligence and life sciences. This call for investment comes as the Labour government is getting ready to unveil its budget plan in October, while dealing with a stagnant economy. Starmer's government, in the early days of its tenure, flagged a £22 billion ($29 billion) financing shortfall after his administration performed an audit. Former Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt, for the Conservative Party, in July wrote to Simon Case, the head of the British civil service, labeling Labour's claims about the public finances "deeply troubling." Starmer has, more recently, been accused of being too negative on the U.K economy, and Labour's plans to ax the U.K.'s non-dom tax regime has also been criticized. "We will stabilize the economy," said Starmer Thursday. "There are going to be more hard decisions to be made when it comes to the budget." Earlier this week, Starmer's plan to cut payments that offset fuel costs for pensioners was rejected by his own party in a symbolic vote at the Labour Party's Annual Conference. "No one wants to change the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. But by doing that, we stabilize the economy," Starmer told Sorkin. "We can commit to what we call the triple lock, which means that they get more money year-on-year." The U.K.'s "triple lock" is where the state pension rises each year by either 2.5%, the inflation rate, or earnings growth — whichever is highest. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is due this morning; U.S. stock futures are steady after Thursday's jump and the S&P 500's record close; Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly revenue numbers; almost 1.2 million electricity customers are without power in Florida as Helene slams the state as a Category 4 hurricane; and Intel (INTC) reportedly rebuffs a bid by Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division. Here's what investors need to know today. Market watchers will be focused on the Fed's preferred inflation measure to gauge the future path of interest rates, after last week's half-percentage-point cut signaled the central bank's view that price pressures are easing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is expected to have risen 2.3% year-over-year in August, down from 2.5% in July, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, but the "core" number is expected to have risen to 2.7% from 2.6%. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes surged Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high after a strong earnings report from Micron (MU) sent chip stocks sharply higher and shares of companies with exposure to the Chinese economy jumped on reports of additional government stimulus. The Nasdaq finished higher for a fourth straight session yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched closer to another record high of its own. Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping 1% in premarket trading after the warehouse retailer's quarterly revenue missed analysts' expectations as growth slowed. The company's fiscal fourth-quarter sales growth was just 1% year-over-year, offsetting earnings that topped forecasts. Investors will be watching how higher membership fees could affect the company’s results going forward. Hurricane Helene landed in Florida as a Category 4 storm Thursday night with wind speeds of around 140 miles per hour, with about 1.2 million customers losing power in the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved farther inland over Georgia, but a "life-threatening storm surge, winds, and heavy rains continue," the National Hurricane Center said. Troubled chipmaker Intel (INTC) has rejected a bid by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division, Bloomberg reported late Thursday. Earlier this week, the news outlet reported that Apollo Global Management had offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, days after The Wall Street Journal said that Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a "takeover approach" for it. Intel shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down more than 50% this year. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Arm are edging lower.

Ark's ARKB ETF leads with $113.8 million inflow, marking a significant turnaround. On Sept. 26, Bitcoin ETFs recorded substantial inflows totaling $365.7 million, marking the highest single-day inflow since July 22, when $530 million entered the market. According to Farside data, Ark’s ARKB ETF led with $113.8 million, marking a significant shift after recent outflows seen earlier this month. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF added $93.4 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC ETF reported inflows of $74 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF also saw strong participation with $50.4 million, and VanEck’s HODL ETF contributed $22.1 million. Invesco’s BTCO and Franklin’s EZBC reported smaller additions of $6.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC continued its trend of outflows, losing $7.7 million, while its smaller BTC ETF gained $2.9 million. Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows of $0.1 million, continuing the recent trend of mixed investor sentiment in the Ethereum space. Grayscale’s ETHE fund saw the most significant movement with outflows of $36 million, contrasting with BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH, which brought in $15.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Inflows were also recorded for Bitwise’s ETHW, Invesco’s QETH, and 21Shares’ CETH, albeit in smaller amounts. Other funds, including those from VanEck and Franklin, remained relatively flat. The contrasting flows highlight evolving trends. Bitcoin ETFs attract substantial inflows across major funds, mainly driven by Ark and BlackRock, while Ethereum ETFs face continued outflows, primarily from Grayscale. The flows coincided with Bitcoin also breaking $65k for the first time since August. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

Title: The Hollywood Cuts Keep Comin’ As Disney Does Another Worker Cleanse

(Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) As if Hollywood needed any more reminders why the mantra “Stay Alive Until 2025” is going to be difficult for many industry workers, Disney embarked this week on another 300 layoffs, on top of thousands of other reductions there and across the industry. This set of layoffs in the Burbank, Calif.-based Disney largely hit corporate workers in divisions such as legal, human resources, finance and communications, Deadline reported. All told, CEO Bob Iger has targeted 8,000 jobs for elimination. Some 4,000 of those cuts landed in April of last year, but more keep coming. In May, Disney’s Pixar laid off 175 workers amid a sustained box-office slump for the animation unit’s films. Even the subsequent record-setting performance of Inside Out 2 this summer wasn’t enough to fend off the Mouse House reaper. The Disney reductions, part of $7.5 billion in spending cuts that CEO Bob Iger instituted beginning late last year, haven’t spared sports either, even though that sector has been the most watched and lucrative remaining corner of broadcast and cable. This week, for instance, Disney’s ESPN division continued to lay off on-air talent, this time with NBA reporter and podcast star Zach Lowe. His departure follows recent ones by Robert Griffin III and Sam Ponder, who both, like Lowe, made more than $1 million a year. Five behind-the-camera executives, including Head of Content Operations Stephanie Druley, also have departed as part of a reorganization that Burke Magnus, ESPN’s President, Programming and Original Content, told staff in a memo this week will make the company “more strategic, collaborative and nimble” while resulting in “new positions or promotions for people who are expanding their responsibilities or taking on new challenges.” Basically, the survivors will get to do more with less. The cuts come amid the unexpected retirement of NBA scoop-meister Adrian Wojnarowski, who earlier this month walked away from an estimated $20 million remaining in his ESPN contract to become general manager of the men’s basketball team at his alma mater, tiny St. Bonaventure’s University in upstate New York. Disney is, of course, far from the only Hollywood media giant getting buffeted by the industry’s many changes. Paramount Global is headed toward a sale to a group led by Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Nonetheless, Paramount’s three-headed office of the CEO is proceeding with 15% cuts across its operations, which are far smaller (and less profitable) than Disney’s. The latest cuts wiped out entire offices, such as the communications unit for Paramount+, the company’s main streaming service. All gone, Deadline reported Friday. Similarly, the streaming service’s eight-person content strategy team was wiped out, perhaps further indication that the strategy for Paramount+ is to stop operating after the merger sometime next year. Given the debt crunch Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone were facing, deep cuts were inevitable, especially in an expected Skydance merger of overlapping operations in film, TV and animation production. But it’s all of a piece with larger layoff waves washing over the industry. Debt-saddled Warner Bros. Discovery has undergone seemingly endless cuts, layoffs and closures since it was created 2.5 years ago from a merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia (and still more cuts during AT&T’s spotty stewardship previously). Even Comcast may be vulnerable, especially as the price of NBCUniversal’s new $2.5-billion-per-year NBA rights deal starts to bite next year, even though its parts include the eponymous cable provider, wireless carrier, and theme parks, among other holdings. Disney told the New York Times in a statement that it is looking to manage resources and costs “more effectively” to “fuel the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney.” Hollywood’s biggest media company is hardly alone in that search. The streaming wars proved ruinously expensive — even for relative winners such as Disney+ and Hulu, which Disney now fully controls. Losses just from subscription streaming-video operations have topped $11 billion across the industry, according to SEC filings by the various contenders. That total doesn’t include any losses at Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video, their programming and operating costs subsumed within (and unreported by) the vast mass of their far more lucrative main businesses, though even they are reportedly tightening program spending and operational costs. Wall Street pressures have been growing to turn streaming operations into profitable operations, a process made more complicated by the continued, and increasing, swoon in customers watching the companies’ legacy cable and broadcast operations. Cord-cutting has nearly halved the cable subscription footprint to a little more than 50 million U.S. households. All the streaming operations, even those owned by Netflix and tech giants Apple and Amazon, have been cutting or re-prioritizing their spending on entertainment properties. Even industry leader Netflix is spending differently, even as it continues to generate billions in cash flow. The company has spent around $17 billion a year on programming the past few years, executives have repeatedly said in earnings calls. But now Netflix is spending more on live events, like The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which proved to be one of the company’s most-watched shows of 2024’s first half, according to the company. Netflix also recently announced a deal to carry two NFL games this Christmas Day. That’ll likely be huge for Netflix, but also means the reported $150 million paid for the two games’ rights won’t be spent on, say, five run-of-the-mill rom-coms or a couple of mid-level action comedies. For that matter, Netflix has also been profitably licensing more and more old shows from its erstwhile competitors, who after a few years of the streaming wars freezeouts, once again are welcoming the found money of a Netflix deal for a library show such as Suits. While that’s good money for the owners and creators of those older shows, that’s also money that won’t be spent making new shows, either at Netflix or at the production studios. All of that has also translated to deep problems at Los Angeles production, post-production, visual-effects and other corners of the industry that regularly do projects with the studios.

Title: BlackRock Highlights Bitcoin’s Unique Properties as Approved IBIT Options Could Cement Risk-Off Status
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/27/blackrock-highlights-bitcoins-unique-properties-believes-btc-is-risk-off-in-the-long-term/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T09:51:00Z
Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by BlackRock released a report last week, titled "bitcoin as a unique diversifier." The investment giant identified four key points from the report. First, how to analyze bitcoin (BTC) in relation to traditional financial assets due to its fundamental properties, such as not having a quarterly earnings report or a CEO. Second, bitcoin's high volatility can be perceived as a "risky" asset, which contributes to the discussion that whether it is a "risk-on" or "risk-off" asset. The token could be considered a flight-to-safety option because it is scarce, non-sovereign, and decentralized. Lastly, BlackRock pointed out that the long-term adoption of bitcoin may come from global instability. Bitcoin's realized volatility continues to trend downwards over time, indicating increased stability. In the early years of bitcoin, its realized volatility used to trade over 200%; however, as the asset matured, so did the volatility. Since 2018, realized volatility has not exceeded 100% and is currently at 50%. As realized volatility decreases and liquidity increases through financial instruments such as the spot and futures market, this may bring in more sophisticated investors such as options traders. This seems to be on the horizon with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of physically settled options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. BlackRock also asked the question: Is bitcoin risk-on or risk-off? While short-term trading may suggest that bitcoin behaves like a risk-on asset, the data reveals a different narrative over a longer time horizon. According to data from bitcoin custody service Unchained, "almost all holders (99%+) are in profit if they held for just three years. All bitcoin holders in this class are in profit if they held for at least 5 years". We can see this type of mentality on-chain among investors, where over 65% of the circulating bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for more than one year, according to Glassnode. This trend suggests that many investors tend to hold bitcoin because they believe in its store-of-value narrative and view it as a risk-off asset, even though bitcoin has faced multiple 20% corrections in 2024. BlackRock also showed that bitcoin has a very low correlation to U.S. equities. A graph shows the trailing 6-month S&P 500 correlation with bitcoin; the average correlation is 0.2 since 2015. Sometimes, assets will trade near one-to-one with one another due to external macro factors, most likely in risk-off or liquidity events. The report notes, "These episodes have been short-term in nature and have failed to produce a clear long-term statistically significant correlation relationship." Continuing with the theme of having a long-term time preference, BlackRock noted that bitcoin tends to outperform other risk-on assets after 60 days following a major geopolitical event. The U.S.- Iran escalation in 2020 saw bitcoin return 20% after 60 days, outperforming gold and S&P 500. This was also the case for Covid-19, the 2020 U.S. election challenges, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. regional banking crisis, and most recently, the Yen Carry trade unwind on Aug. 5. During the recent Yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5, which was now 53 days ago, major assets experienced declines on the day. However, bitcoin has risen by 22% since then, with gold and the S&P 500 up roughly 11%. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Google to invest $3.3 billion building two data centers in South Carolina
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-invest-33-billion-building-two-data-centers-in-south-carolina/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T07:52:02Z
Full Content:
Google has announced its plans to invest $3.3 billion in two new data centers in South Carolina. The news comes as rivals, including Microsoft and Amazon, have started investing heavily in infrastructure upgrades for use in AI, as they provide the necessary computing power, data storage, and network connectivity, all essential for processing vast amounts of data efficiently. Out of the $3.3 billion, a significant portion of the investment, $2 billion, will be allocated for campuses at Pine Hill Business Campus in Ridgeville and Winding Woods Commerce Park in St. George. The other $1.3 billion would be used to expand Google's existing data center in Berkeley County and is expected to create 200 operational jobs in the region. Google is not the only big tech company that is expanding its data centers. Microsoft recently announced a massive $30 billion fund to invest in AI infrastructure which includes building data centers, energy projects, and more, in partnership with BlackRock and an investment firm. Google is itself investing €1 billion (around $1.1 billion) in expanding its data center in Finland and $2 billion in an AI data center in Malaysia. Amazon is also investing $11 billion in new data centers in Indiana and even includes four solar farms and a wind farm, with a combined capacity of more than 600 MW for the data center's energy needs. Energy demand is likely to soar as big tech companies continue to build and expand energy-hungry data centers across the globe to meet their AI capabilities. However, they are likely to be run on green energy in the near future. A notable example is Microsoft's recent announcement to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. The facility, infamous for a significant nuclear accident in 1979, will now supply 835 megawatts of power to support Microsoft's data centers, as the company aims to run all its data centers on clean energy by 2025.

Hi, what are you looking for? From disinformation campaigns to soaring scepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media has been hit with blow. By Published From disinformation campaigns to soaring scepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media landscape has been hit with blow after blow. World News Day, taking place on Saturday with the support of hundreds of organisations including AFP, aims to raise awareness about the challenges endangering the hard-pressed industry. – ‘Broken business model’ – In 2022, UNESCO warned that “the business model of the news media is broken”. Advertising revenue — the lifeline of news publications — has dried up in recent years, with Internet giants such as Google and Facebook owner Meta soaking up half of that spending, the report said. Meta, Amazon and Google’s parent company Alphabet alone account for 44 percent of global ad spend, while only 25 percent goes to traditional media organisations, according to a study by the World Advertising Research Center. Platforms like Facebook “are now explicitly deprioritising news and political content”, the Reuters Institute’s 2024 Digital News Report pointed out. Traffic from social to news sites has sharply declined as a result, causing a drop in revenue. Few are keen to pay for news. Only 17 percent of people polled across 20 wealthy countries said they had online news subscriptions in 2023. Such trends, leading to rising costs, have resulted in “layoffs, closures, and other cuts” in media organisations around the world, the study found. – Eroding trust – Public trust in the media has increasingly eroded in recent years. Only four in 10 respondents said they trusted news most of the time, the Reuters Institute reported. Meanwhile, young people are relying more on influencers and content creators than newspapers to stay informed. For them, video is king, with the study citing the influence of TikTok and YouTube stars such as American Vitus Spehar and Frenchman Hugo Travers, known for his channel HugoDecrypte. – Growing disinformation – The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed concerns about disinformation — rife on social platforms — as the tool can generate convincing text and images. In the United States, partisan websites masquerading as media outlets now outnumber American newspaper sites, the research group NewsGuard, which tracks misinformation, said in June. “Pink slime” outlets — politically motivated websites that present themselves as independent local news outlets — are largely powered by AI. This appears to be an effort to sway political beliefs ahead of the US election. As part of a national crackdown on disinformation, Brazil’s Supreme Court suspended access to Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter. The court accused the social media platform of refusing to remove accounts charged with spreading fake news, and flouting other judicial rulings. “Eradicating disinformation seems impossible, but things can be implemented,” Reporters Without Borders (RSF) editorial director Anne Bocande told AFP. Platforms can bolster regulation and create news reliability indicators, like RSF’s Journalism Trust Initiative, Bocande said. – Alarming new player – AI has pushed news media into unchartered territory. US streaming platform Peacock introduced AI-generated custom match reports during the Paris Olympics this year, read with the voice of sports commentator Al Michaels — fuelling fears AI could replace journalists. Despite these concerns, German media giant Axel Springer has decided to bet on AI while refocusing on its core news activities. At its roster, which includes Politico, the Bild tabloid, Business Insider and Die Welt daily, AI will focus on menial production tasks so journalists can dedicate their time to reporting and securing scoops. In a bid to profit from the technology’s rise, the German publisher as well as The Associated Press and The Financial Times signed content partnerships with start-up OpenAI. But the Microsoft-backed firm is also caught in a major lawsuit with The New York Times over copyright violations. – ‘Quiet repression’ – With journalists frequently jailed, killed and attacked worldwide, “repression is a major issue,” said RSF’s Bocande. A total of 584 journalists are languishing behind bars because of their work — with China, Belarus and Myanmar the world’s most prolific jailers of reporters. The war in Gaza sparked by Palestinian militant group Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel has already left a “terrible” mark on press freedom, Bocande added. More than 130 journalists have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since October 7, 2023, including 32 while “in the exercise of their duties”. She said a “quiet repression” campaign is underway in countries around the world, including in democracies — with investigative journalism hampered by fresh laws on national security.

AFP provides fast, comprehensive and verified coverage of the issues affecting our daily lives. With an emphasis on sustainability, adaptability, and evolving work dynamics, the mesh conference brings together diverse perspectives to shape the future.

Dell Technologies has announced a significant shift in its work policy for global sales team employees. According to an internal memo obtained by sources, starting September 30, staff members who can work from company offices will be required to do so five days a week, as per a report by Bloomberg. The tech giant's decision aims to foster a more collaborative environment and enhance skill development among its sales force. The memo emphasised the importance of in-person work, stating, “Working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine,” as quoted by Bloomberg. Field representatives are expected to divide their time between customer and partner interactions and office presence, totalling five days a week. This marks an increase from the previous three-day in-office requirement, per the report. However, the company has made provisions for certain employees, noting, “Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely,” Bloomberg reported. Dell has promised to provide additional information regarding remote workers shortly. In August, Dell announced a significant restructuring of its sales division, including layoffs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and prioritise artificial intelligence. According to an internal memo sent to staff on August 6, the company said it plans to consolidate its sales teams and establish a new unit focused on AI, Business Insider reported. While Dell has not disclosed the exact number of employees affected, estimates suggest that around 12,500 workers, representing roughly 10% of the company's total workforce, may be impacted, according to a report from Newsbyte. Dell's move comes amid a broader trend of tech companies reevaluating their remote work policies established during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many firms have embraced hybrid models, some are pushing for a more substantial office presence. In a similar vein, e-commerce giant Amazon recently announced plans to require employees to work from company offices five days a week starting next year, a stricter policy compared to their previous three-day mandate. Dell has recently faced challenges in its core personal computer business, which has not rebounded as strongly as expected following a prolonged downturn. The tech giant's latest financial report, released on August 30, revealed a decline in revenue for its fiscal second quarter. The company posted $12.4 billion in revenue, representing a 4% decrease compared to the same period in the previous year and falling slightly short of market projections. The report highlighted a stark contrast between Dell's PC business segments. While sales of business-oriented computers remained relatively stable, the consumer PC division experienced a significant downturn, with revenue plummeting by 22 per cent year-on-year. In response to these financial headwinds, Dell signalled its intention to implement strategic cost-cutting measures in a regulatory filing submitted on September 11. “We remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business transformation initiatives and will continue to take certain measures to reduce costs."

Title: Is Satoshi Nakamoto’s position as top Bitcoin holder at risk?

Bitcoin ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings. Can it surpass Satoshi Nakamoto by year-end? After a period marked by minimal activity, BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBIT) has regained momentum, recording substantial inflows starting on the 23rd of September. Notably, on the 25th of September, IBIT saw an impressive influx of $184.4 million, while the total inflow across all Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $105.9 million. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC, which usually experiences outflows, reported zero movement on the same day. However, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark’s ARKB experienced outflows of $33.2 million and $47.4 million, respectively. This resurgence in ETF activity has propelled the U.S. BTC ETF to an astounding $17.944 billion in inflows for 2024, marking a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC—only about 84,000 BTC shy of the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. Seeing this impressive growth, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst took to X and noted, “U.S. bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock..” Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is estimated to hold approximately 1.1 million BTC, a figure that institutional BTC ETFs are rapidly approaching. Recent data indicates that these ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings, and if the trend of increasing inflows continues, it could soon surpass him. Currently, Satoshi Nakamoto leads the list of the top Bitcoin holders, closely trailed by Binance with 673,783 BTC. Notably, major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale collectively hold a significant 901,101 BTC through their ETF products, with individual holdings of 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. Source: Eric Balchunas/X In contrast, the remaining five asset managers with BTC ETFs possess a combined total of just 14,946 BTC. Sharing a similar line of thought was Spencer Hakimian, Founder of Tolou Capital Management who said, “ETF’s going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas Day.” Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, ranks sixth with 252,220 BTC and is on a path to potentially join the top tier of Bitcoin holders. Thus, as BTC ETFs continue to capture attention, Bitcoin itself has seen a resurgence in price. After facing challenges in breaking through the $60,000 barrier, BTC was trading at $64,358, reflecting a modest increase of 0.91% over the past 24 hours.

This marked their highest single-day acquisition in September. The news shows a renewed demand for Bitcoin, especially in the exchange-traded fund (ETFs) market. With this purchase, BlackRock solidified its position as the leading Bitcoin holder, surpassing other firms. BlackRock’s latest acquisition represents a significant shift in market dynamics. The firm now holds a total of 359,279 BTC, valued at approximately $23 billion. This amount far exceeds holdings by other firms like MicroStrategy, which has 107,059 BTC less than BlackRock. This massive investment also signals a rebound in the Bitcoin ETF market. The U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs debuted in January, sparking a wave of demand. Bitcoin ETFs recorded a massive single-day inflow of $1.05 billion in March and a total net asset of $62.5 billion in June. However, the market saw a decline in demand during July. Interestingly, recent trends show that inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have picked up again. According to Farside Investors, BlackRock’s $184.3 million Bitcoin Purchase contributed to $105.8 million in single-day inflows for U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BIBT) experienced positive inflows that day. BIBT saw a net inflow of $2.07 million, while other funds like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) sold 525 BTC, worth $33.2 million. Also, the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) offloaded $47.41 million in Bitcoin. Other issuers, such as Grayscale, reported zero inflows. Amid these developments, an X user shared that the 30-day flow indicator for Bitcoin ETFs has turned positive. This is a welcome change after a period of negative trends, and it shows that issuers have seen an average net inflow over the past month. #Bitcoin spot ETF demand has rebounded, with the 30-day net change in total holdings turning positive. pic.twitter.com/c0C8BaFPDq — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) September 26, 2024 These funds have received new money for five days, totaling almost $500 million. Additionally, they have received more money in nine out of the last ten days. “The U.S. is regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand,” says Ki Young Ju. Historically, the U.S. has dominated Bitcoin holdings among public firms. The recent surge in inflows has helped restore that dominance, which had dipped due to previous lackluster performance. The renewed interest in the market is evident in BTC’s price. On September 25, Bitcoin declined to $62,700. However, after this BlackRock purchase, BTC’s price has now been around $64,000. Also, BTC is trading above its 50-day and 200-day SMA lines, suggesting a bullish sentiment. Looking at its chart, BTC is closer to breaking its primary resistance at $64,700. A cross above this level will boost the bullish momentum in the market. Your email address will not be published.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss. AI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. AI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds. Tom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. Lisa Su, the CEO of the firm, recently said that graphic processing units (GPUs) might not be the architecture of choice for companies working on AI within the next five years because they did not offer the level of programmability tech firms wanted. The CEO was contextualizing earlier statements in which she said that GPUs right now were the architecture of choice for large language models, because they were very efficient for parallel processing. Su further noted that the next phase would not be a transition away from GPUs but rather a broadening beyond them. Custom AI chips, tailored to company-specific AI tasks, are already gaining traction in the tech world, highlighting the broadening away from GPUs. Overall AMD ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pendle Foundation, BitMEX Co-Founder Moving PENDLE To Binance—What’s Going On?

Time Published: 2024-09-27T01:30:04Z

PENDLE, the native token of Pendle, a real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, may be steady at press time. However, looking at CoinMarketCap data, the token is up 130X from its November 2022 lows and 41% from all-time highs registered in 2024. As prices cool off, there are emerging concerns. According to trackers, the Pendle Foundation, tasked with promoting the RWA platform, has been offloading tokens. At the same time, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, one of the first crypto perpetual trading platforms, is selling. Specifically, over the last three weeks, a big chunk of PENDLE transfers have been moved to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, a net negative for sentiment. On September 16, the foundation’s governance wallet moved 600,000 PENDLE worth over $2.4 million to Binance. Over the past year, the wallet has moved 3.72 million PENDLE worth over $11.95 million to Binance. Meanwhile, Spot on Chain has also picked out transfers from Hayes. On September 24, the BitMEX co-founder deposited 240,000 PENDLE worth over $958,000 to Binance. Over the last four days, Hayes has moved more than $6.5 million of the token to Binance. Hayes is one of the PENDLE whales. Although there is no direct proof that the former BitMEX executive has been selling, moving tokens to Binance could signal his intention to sell. Currently, Hayes owns over 253,00 PENDLE worth nearly $990,000. This holding represents around 4% of his overall crypto portfolio. Despite the exchange transfers, the token continues to shake off Q3 2024 weaknesses. Buyers are back in the equation after sinking to as low as $1.7 in early August. At press time, the token is up 100% from August lows, and buyers are bent on reclaiming the April 2024 highs at around $7.2. For the uptrend to remain, buyers must hold steady above $3.5, or August highs, and sustain the current upside momentum. Looking at the daily chart, bull bars are banding along the upper BB–a volatility indicator–suggesting that the underlying momentum is strong. If buyers build on this, PENDLE could register fresh all-time highs, incentivizing more whales to HODL. Currently, CoinMarketCap data shows that over 58% of all tokens in circulation is held by whales. Dalmas, a seasoned crypto reporter, brings a unique perspective to the industry.

Title: EXCLUSIVE: Investment Giants Leveraged Red State Universities’ Endowment Funds To Back Anti-Oil Agenda, Report Finds
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2024/09/26/exclusive-investment-giants-leveraged-red-state-universities-endowment-funds-anti-oil-agenda-report/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T01:03:12Z
Full Content:
Several asset managers leveraged two major Texas university systems’ endowment funds to advance anti-fossil fuel shareholder proposals in 2022 and 2023, according to a report from the conservative watchdog group American Accountability Foundation (AAF). BlackRock-owned Aperio Group, Cantillon, former Vice President Al Gore-chaired Generation Investment Management, GQG Partners and JP Morgan Asset Management collectively manage approximately $4 billion for The University of Texas/Texas A&M Investment Management Company (UTIMCO) as of July, which handles the university systems’ endowments. Despite the company’s policy against it and Texas’ status as the leading crude oil and natural gas-producing state, UTIMCO’s asset managers backed over 150 shareholder resolutions under the environmental, social and governance (ESG) umbrella, including proposals that could undermine the oil and gas industry, according to documents AAF obtained through a public records request and shared exclusively with the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Once again, woke ESG ideology has infected a public institution and hijacked its money for their own purposes. This is an outrageous betrayal of the public’s trust,” AAF president Thomas Jones told the DCNF. “[Republican Texas] Gov. Greg Abbott must take immediate action to end this nonsense. He must shake up the leadership at UT/A&M that let this happen and use his influence with UTIMCO to ensure that it never happens again.” UTIMCO told the DCNF that the ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)-related votes violate “a long-standing policy that prohibits using the endowments’ economic power to advance social or political agendas” and that a review found they consist of 0.3% out of around 45,000 proxy votes in recent years. The endowment manager added that it has since modified its guidelines after finding the violative votes and will impose them on all of its third-party investment managers before future proxy votes, and revoking voting authority for those that cannot follow them. 🚨EXCLUSIVE🚨Swing State’s Pension Funds Used By Wall Street Titans To Push ‘Racial Equity’, Climate Agenda, Report Finds from @jasonJournoDC https://t.co/LXx3y4WZPV — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) January 25, 2024 The company’s asset managers voted in favor of a total of 159 shareholder proposals between them that include “racial and gender pay gap reports, efforts to defund conservative candidates and pro-business trade associations, radical climate policy, targeting of gun purchasers, and proabortion initiatives,” according to the watchdog. UTIMCO oversees the largest public endowment fund in the U.S., managing over $76 billion as of Aug. 31. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Swing State’s Pension Funds Used To Advance ‘Racial Equity,’ Climate Initiatives, Report Finds) “UTIMCO’s mission is to ‘generate superior long-term investment returns to support The University of Texas and Texas A&M University Systems,’ yet these votes endorse political agendas that run contrary to the Systems’ best interests,” American Energy Institute CEO and former Republican Texas state Rep. Jason Isaac told the DCNF. “By supporting proposals that harm American energy producers, UTIMCO’s fund managers are violating their fiduciary responsibility.” Texas leads the nation in crude oil and natural gas production and in 2023 was responsible for 43% of crude oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, AAF found many examples of UTIMCO’s asset managers voting in favor of proposals aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions and other actions to mitigate so-called climate change, which the watchdog alleges comes at the expense of producing value for investors. For instance, at ExxonMobil’s May 2023 yearly shareholder meeting, Aperio Group voted in support of a proposal to recalculate its GHG emissions to account for the assets it has sold. The resolution asserted that “the economic risks associated with climate change exist in the real world rather than on company balance sheets” and argues that the investments ExxonMobil sells may lower emissions on paper but that they fail to actually help achieve the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by 1.5 degrees Celsius — which is an objective of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement — potentially exposing the company and its stakeholders to what it calls “climate risk.” Some of Aperio Group’s clients have access to customize their individual proxy voting policy, according to BlackRock. BlackRock itself voted against this ExxonMobil proposal on behalf of most of its clients. AAF’s “report on UTIMCO’s investment practices should alarm every Texan who values our state’s proud oil and gas industry,” Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told the DCNF. “It’s outrageous to see Texas university investments being used to support radical ESG agendas, decarbonization, and dangerous policies like Net Zero and the Paris Accord, which threaten our energy independence and economy. We must put an end to the woke political agendas that undermine the very foundation of Texas’ success and ensure our investments align with the values of hard-working Texans.” Moreover, at defense contractor Raytheon Technologies’ yearly shareholder meeting in May 2023, J.P. Morgan Asset Management backed a proposal urging the company to publish a report on efforts to reduce GHG emissions in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. “Raytheon Technologies creates significant carbon emissions from its value chain and is exposed to numerous climate-related risks,” it states. “Failing to respond to this changing environment may make Raytheon less competitive and have a negative effect on its cost of capital and shareholders’ financial returns.” Isaac told the DCNF that UTIMCO’s “managers are discriminating against fossil fuel” companies through ESG investing based on the definition of “boycott” in Texas’ Senate Bill 13, which Abbot signed in 2021 and the former representative said he helped create. The bill defines boycotting energy companies as refusing to engage or ending business with a company involved in fossil fuels “without an ordinary business purpose.” It also specifies actions aimed “to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations with a company because the company” does business related to fossil fuels and fails to “pledge to meet environmental standards beyond applicable federal and state law.” Isaac added that the asset managers “should be held accountable and placed on Texas’ list of “financial companies that boycott energy companies,” which mandates Texas public investment entities subject to SB 13 “avoid contracting with, and divest from, these companies unless they can demonstrate this would conflict with their fiduciary duties.” The S&P Global Clean Energy Index, which includes companies that engage in energy production from renewable sources, has fallen about 7% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 Energy Index, which features many oil and gas companies, has risen close to 3% in that same time. Louisianans’ pension funds were similarly leveraged to push climate-related proposals within publicly traded companies, the DCNF reported in April, based on another public records request by AAF. “UTIMCO’s asset managers’ apparent promotion of leftist objectives, including ESG, is extremely troubling and contrary to Texas law banning boycotts and discrimination against fossil fuels. The legislature must exercise oversight and hold UTIMCO accountable,” Republican Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison told the DCNF. “Governmental bodies, including their proxies, should not pursue objectives that harm the Texas economy and go against our values.” Cantillon, GQG Partners, Texas A&M and Abbot’s office did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment. Aperio Group, Generation Investment Management, JP Morgan Asset Management and the University of Texas declined to comment.

Title: Netflix co-CEO Peters sells shares worth over $3.1 million
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/netflix-coceo-peters-sells-shares-worth-over-31-million-93CH-3635279
Time Published: 2024-09-27T00:03:09Z
Full Content:
In a recent transaction, Gregory K. Peters, the Co-CEO of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), sold 4,392 shares of the company's common stock, netting over $3.1 million. The sale occurred on September 25, with the shares being sold at a price of $725 each. This sale was part of a prearranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. On the same day, Peters also acquired the same number of shares, 4,392, at a price of $155.35 per share, totaling approximately $682,297. This transaction was related to stock options exercised under the company's stock option plan. Following the sale, Peters still owns a substantial number of Netflix shares, with 13,090 shares remaining in his possession. These transactions indicate a significant trading activity by a top executive within the company, which can often be of interest to investors and market watchers. Netflix, a leading streaming entertainment service, has seen its stock price fluctuate in recent times, and transactions of this nature often draw attention to the company's stock performance and insider confidence. Peters' position as Co-CEO makes his trading activities particularly noteworthy to those following the company's financial developments. Investors and analysts often look to insider buying and selling as a signal of leadership's belief in the company's future prospects. However, it's important to note that there can be many reasons for insiders to sell shares, and such transactions don't necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company. The transactions have been publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing transparency and allowing the investing public to stay informed about significant insider trades at Netflix. In other recent news, Netflix has announced the date for its Q3 2024 earnings release, scheduled for October 17, 2024. The entertainment services leader has also been making significant strides in its advertising business, with JPMorgan predicting that Netflix's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027. Additionally, TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. On another front, the proposed merger between Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets faces regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. The companies may need to sell some of their cricket broadcast rights or commit to advertisement price caps for cricket matches to address these antitrust concerns. Evercore ISI has shown confidence in Netflix's potential, raising its stock target and maintaining an Outperform rating. This comes in the wake of Netflix's surge in upfront advertising commitments, largely due to the addition of NFL games on Christmas Day. These are the recent developments highlighting the growth and challenges faced by these companies in their respective markets. As investors digest the recent insider trading activity by Netflix Co-CEO Gregory K. Peters, it's worth considering the broader financial context provided by InvestingPro. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently boasts a market capitalization of $309.67 billion, underscoring its substantial presence in the entertainment industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at 43.56, reflecting a valuation that is high relative to near-term earnings growth, a point that is also highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips. This may suggest that investors are expecting continued growth and are willing to pay a premium for the company's earnings potential. Another InvestingPro Tip indicates that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt, which can be a reassuring sign for investors concerned about the company's financial leverage. Moreover, the company's strong return over the last year, with a price total return of 88.41%, demonstrates its robust performance in the market. Additionally, with a high gross profit margin of 43.84% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, Netflix shows its ability to efficiently translate sales into profits. For those interested in more in-depth analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, including insights on the company's valuation multiples and profitability forecasts. In fact, there are 15 additional tips listed on InvestingPro for Netflix, which can be found at https://www.investing.com/pro/NFLX.

Guggenheim Treasury Securities (GTS), a subsidiary of financial consulting firm Guggenheim Capital, has issued $20 million worth of Digital Commercial Paper (DCP) on Ethereum. The DCP received a P-1 credit rating from Moody’s. According to a Sept. 26 statement, Guggenheim will issue the paper via a blockchain platform developed by Zeconomy called AmpFi.Digital, which offers tokenization services for qualified investors. Zeconomy CEO Giacinto Cosenza stated: “With tens of billions of dollars locked in DeFi and corporate treasuries, we are thrilled to partner with GTS to address a clear need for more trusted and secure blockchain solutions.” The move comes as the tokenized US treasuries market surpassed $2 billion in market cap, with the participation of traditional finance heavyweights such as asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL has a market cap of over $513 million, while Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX trails close with $435 million. Additionally, AmpFi.Digital stated in the announcement that it aims to address key decentralized finance (DeFi) challenges such as poor credit quality, high fees, and compliance issues. Cosenza added that the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US and the substantial growth in the tokenization market this year highlighted institutional demand for crypto. Notably, nearly $1.6 billion of all tokenized U.S. treasuries are issued using Ethereum as an infrastructure. In addition to BlackRock’s BUIDL, Ondo’s USDY and OUSG and Hashnote’s USYC significantly increase the blockchain’s participation in the tokenized government securities ecosystem. Moreover, CoinDesk reported on Sept. 25 that Visa plans to create a platform that will help institutional firms issue fiat-backed tokens. Ethereum’s infrastructure will also power the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP). Solana holds just 5.5% of the tokenized US government securities market as of Sept. 26, with $122.7 million in tokens issued on the network. However, Franklin Templeton and Citigroup recently announced they are eyeing Solana for their next financial products exploring blockchain technology. During Solana’s ecosystem-focused event Breakpoint, Franklin Templeton revealed its plans to launch a mutual fund natively on Solana. Meanwhile, Citi is considering tapping the network for money programmability through smart contracts aimed at cross-border payments.

Despite breaking the $65,000 area this afternoon, Bitcoin still needs to hold its price above it to confirm the bullish sentiment. SEC Chair Gary Gensler reaffirms Bitcoin's non-security status while criticizing industry non-compliance amid SEC scrutiny. Analysts highlight the convergence of Bitcoin and altcoin momentum as a promising sign for broader market recovery.

Leslie J. Kilgore, a board member at Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), has recently sold a total of 828 shares of the company's common stock, according to the latest SEC filings. The transactions, which took place on September 24 and 25, resulted in a total sale amount exceeding $598,000. On the first day, Kilgore sold 426 shares at a price of $720 each, and on the following day, another 402 shares were sold for $725 apiece. These sales are part of a pre-arranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell shares at predetermined times to avoid concerns about insider trading. In addition to the sales, Kilgore also acquired shares through the exercise of options on both days. The options were exercised at prices ranging from $146.92 to $155.35, with a total transaction value of $125,038 for the acquisition of 828 shares. The recent transactions have adjusted Kilgore's holdings in the video streaming giant, although the exact number of shares owned following the transactions was corrected due to an administrative error in previous filings. The corrected total reflects no omission of reportable transactions from prior filings. Investors often monitor insider trading activity as an indicator of executives' confidence in their company's prospects. Transactions by high-level insiders can provide valuable insights into the company's performance and strategic direction. Netflix continues to be a key player in the competitive streaming market, and the transactions by its executives are closely watched by investors seeking to understand the company's internal perspective. In other recent news, Netflix has announced the date for its Q3 2024 earnings release, scheduled for October 17, 2024. The company will also hold a live video interview with its co-CEOs and CFO following the release. In other developments, Netflix has been making significant strides in its advertising business. Analyst firms JPMorgan and Evercore ISI have maintained an optimistic stance on the company, predicting that Netflix is set to become a major player in the advertising sphere as its ad-supported tier continues to gain traction. They also project that the streaming giant's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027. TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. The firm predicts that advertising will represent 13% of Netflix's total revenue by 2029. Meanwhile, the proposed merger between Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets is facing regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to navigate the competitive landscape of the streaming industry, recent insider trading activity has caught the attention of investors. Leslie J. Kilgore's transactions are a normal part of executive stock management, but they also provide an opportunity to delve into Netflix's current financial standing through real-time data and expert analysis.

Furthermore, the company's revenue growth over the last twelve months stands at 13.0%, showcasing its ability to expand its top-line financials in a challenging market. Another noteworthy InvestingPro Tip is that Netflix's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, which is a positive sign of financial health, especially when considering the company's moderate level of debt.

Title: Vistra is the Top S&P 500 Gainer This Year—Key Stock Price Levels to Monitor
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/vistra-stock-top-s-and-p-500-performer-in-2024-key-price-levels-to-watch-8718660

Full Content:
Shares in electric utility Vistra (VST), the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 this year, hit another record high in early trading Thursday before losing ground to close lower. Wall Street analysts say that the utility’s nuclear assets place it in a position to capitalize on the significant energy requirements needed to power artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, such as data centers. In reports this week, Jefferies bumped its 12-month target on the stock to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley upwardly revised its target on the shares to $132 from $110, The AI utilities poster-child's stock price has surged three-fold since the start of the year, recently toppling AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) for the coveted position of the S&P 500’s top performing stock. Vistra hit a new high of $122.01 early Thursday, before retreating to finish 4.1% lower at $114.16. The stock had risen nearly 6% on Wednesday. Below, we take a closer look at Vistra's chart and use technical analysis to point out important price levels to watch out for. After completing a 12-month trending move higher in May, Vistra shares traded within a symmetrical triangle for several months before staging a breakout above the pattern earlier this month. In recent weeks, the stock has continued to make an impulsive move higher on above-average volume, indicating strong buying conviction. The relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 80 threshold, but also warns of extremely overbought conditions that could give rise to near-term profit taking. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key levels on Vistra’s chart likely to attract attention. During retracements, the shares could initially retest the $107 level, where they may find support around the prominent late-May peak, which also marks the start of the symmetrical triangle. Further selling could see the shares fall to the $95 region, a location on the chart where investors may seek entry points near a trendline connecting comparable trading levels from May to July with the Sept. 19 pre-gap high. A deeper retracement in the shares could bring the $76 level into play. This area, sitting just below the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline, would likely encounter buying interest near the April swing high and this month’s swing low. To project a price target for the stock’s current trending move, investors can use the measuring principle. To do this, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to the breakout point. For example, we add $50 to $85, which forecasts an upside target of $135. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Title: Newly Reduced Quest 3 Price and Quest 3S Pre-orders Now Available on Amazon

Time Published: 2024-09-26T22:10:24Z

The newly discounted Meta Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon, along with pre-orders of the new Quest 3S (128GB) and (256GB), with that sweet, speedy Prime shipping. All now include the promised bundle that includes Batman: Arkham Shadow and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. It wasn’t initially clear exactly when the newly reduced Quest 3 price would hit—would we have to wait until Quest 3S actually launches on October 15th? Turns out, nope! The newly discounted Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon for $500. Just yesterday the headset was listing at its original price of $650. It also now includes a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. The Quest 3 (128GB) model is being phased out, with its own price reduced to $430 while stock remains. At the time of writing, Amazon says it’s already out of stock. But it’s currently offering an even further discounted refurbished Quest 3 (128GB) for just $380. The refurbished unit does not appear to include the Batman Arkham Shadow and Meta Quest+ bundle. As for Meta’s new Quest 3S, both models can be pre-ordered on Amazon ahead of the October 15th release date, with the (128GB) model for $300, and the (256GB) model for $400. Both include a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. Important note: right now the Quest 3S (128GB) is showing delivery from Amazon right around release date, but the Quest 3S (256GB) isn’t expect to deliver until the end of November. It’s unclear if this is a fluke. We’ll be keeping our eye on the date, but in the meantime it looks like ordering the (256GB) headset direct from Meta may mean an earlier delivery. Other places to check for Quest 3S stock and favorable delivery dates include Best Buy, Newegg, Walmart, and Target. Not sure if you should get Quest 3 or Quest 3S? Compare the specs and get our take right here. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. Meta finally getting the website-wide coverage. Glad to see no scams, over promising and under delivering, kickstarter swindels, no humble bundle sales etc on front page. I checked the 128GB Quest 3 on their site and Amazon right after the live Connect conference ended and it was out of stock already. Sounds like they're holding units back so people get the 512GB model instead, but that's just my speculation. Either way, what a lineup. 3S isn't for me (after 3's pancake lenses, I can't go back to fresnel) but it will definitely help VR in the same way Quest 2 did. What a nothingburger of a show …. ILMI remains eerily silent. No HorizonOS update. Not even any new Home enviornments. *sigh* But these reduced prices should push VR ahead nicely during the Christmas shopping season. 8^ ) 512GB is nice, but I still have more then enough room free on my Pico 4 128GB (and I'm still using it as standalone as my wifi setup and PC are still too old to do proper wireless PCVR, still use my HTC Vive Pro/wireless module for that), so 512GB is still overkill for me at the moment, maybe with the next generation it might make sense for me to buy a headset with more GB's.

Title: Why Solana Is Poised To Smash $330 Price Milestone And Capture 50% Of Ether’s Market Cap
URL: https://zycrypto.com/why-solana-is-poised-to-smash-330-price-milestone-and-capture-50-of-ethers-market-cap/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T21:33:41Z
Full Content:
According to data from CoinGecko, among the top ten major cryptocurrencies by market value, Solana (SOL) has registered considerable gains over the past seven days (7.5%), even surpassing Bitcoin’s 1.8% growth. According to VanEck, at press time, SOL is trading for $155 and appears ready to extend its bullish momentum to hit $330 and reach 50% of Ether’s market capitalization. In a Sept. 25 report, VanEck’s research department, MarketVector, noted that Solana has beaten Ethereum in several important areas. For instance, the report’s authors observed that Solana has a high throughput and can process thousands of transactions per second, which is roughly 3,000% higher than Ethereum’s TPS. Moreover, Solana boasts 1,300% more daily active users than Ether, and its transaction fees are “5 million percent cheaper”, making it a more efficient and scalable network. The report highlights decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and payments as key areas where Solana can challenge Ethereum. Solana’s ability to transcend Ethereum in terms of speed and costs gives it an edge in the fast-growing sector. “Another major use-case is lending and borrowing within the DeFi space, a sector expected to continue growing at a rapid pace. Payments and remittances also hold massive potential, especially with Solana’s lower fees and faster transaction times. If institutions and everyday users can save money through cheaper, faster transactions, Solana’s user base could grow even more rapidly”, VanEck stated. The authors wonder why we haven’t yet witnessed a massive exodus toward Solana from Ethereum, particularly from institutions, despite these impressive SOL statistics. In terms of institutional adoption, Solana trails behind its older rival, which won further validation in July this year when United States regulators gave the nod to nine spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Although demand for these ETH instruments is rather lackluster, the approval indicates that institutional investors now have more appetite for ether. The landscape around a U.S.-listed spot Solana ETF, remains in limbo. While other countries, like Brazil, have already greenlighted such products, BlackRock execs recently asserted that “it will be a while before we see” a SOL ETF in America. Nonetheless, the VanEck analysts observed that retail investors are “slowly waking up” to Solana’s potential to challenge Ethereum’s status as the smart contracts king. VanEck further pointed out that Solana’s market cap remains only 22% of Ethereum’s. The report attributes this huge gap to Ether’s first-mover advantage and the wider institutional trust brought on by the ETFs. However, the researchers believe these advantages won’t guarantee Ethereum’s reign forever. Solana should focus on its strengths to ultimately close this wide gap. Meanwhile, the report suggested that Solana is grossly undervalued owing to its technical achievements and could potentially reach 50% of Ethereum’s market cap. Should this materialize, the price of SOL could rocket to $330, given ETH’s present price and market cap of $2,635 and $315 billion, respectively.

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher as the latest estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth slightly outpaced expectations in the second quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 added 0.4% on Thursday, printing a new all-time closing high. The Dow gained 0.6%, ending just below the level of Tuesday's record close. The Nasdaq was also up 0.6%, boosted by strength in the tech sector and solid gains from semiconductor stocks. Micron Technology (MU) shares secured Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, skyrocketing 14.7% after the memory chip maker beat revenue estimates and provided higher-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner nearly doubled its revenue from the year-ago period, with strong artificial intelligence (AI) demand helping underpin the strong sales growth. The firm's CEO said Micron's competitive positioning has reached its highest point in company history. Circuit board manufacturer Jabil (JBL) also reported strong quarterly results, topping sales and profit estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter. Like Micron, Jabil benefitted from strong AI demand during the quarter. The electronics manufacturer and Apple (AAPL) supplier also approved a $1 billion share repurchase plan and announced several cost-cutting initiatives. Jabil shares jumped 11.7% on Thursday. Shares of beauty products company Estée Lauder (EL) popped 10.0% higher following the announcement of an economic stimulus in China. The makeup maker generates around a third of its revenue from the Asia/Pacific region. However, in its most recent earnings report, Estée Lauder pointed to softness in the prestige beauty market in China as a key factor behind its 2% year-over-year decline in organic net sales. Any improvement in consumer sentiment that results from the stimulus could flow through to increased consumer spending and help drive a sales recovery for Estée Lauder in the key market. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged 12.2%, falling further than any other S&P 500 stock on Thursday. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the server and data storage provider's accounting practices. News of the DOJ probe follows a report published last month by activist short-selling firm Hindenburg Research alleging that Supermicro had engaged in accounting manipulation. Crude oil futures prices fell more than 3% amid reports that Saudi Arabia and other major producers are prepared to increase oil output in December, pressuring oil and gas stocks. Diamondback Energy (FANG) stock slid 6.5%, with news that insiders sold more than $2.3 billion worth of in the exploration and production company. Softness in natural gas prices also dragged on companies in that part of the energy sector. Shares of natural gas players Targa Resources (TRGP) and Oneok (OKE) were down around 5.9%.

Title: Analysts Say Meta's Ambitions Make It a Top AI Pick

JPMorgan and Jefferies analysts said Meta's (META) AI and metaverse ambitions make it a top pick after the tech giant's Connect event keynote Wednesday, where Meta unveiled several new products and AI features. The analysts said the event showcased Meta's progress in monetizing AI and made them more bullish on the stock, with JPMorgan analysts writing Thursday that they believe Meta has "earned the right to spend big on AI," given its "early AI benefits in both engagement and monetization." Jefferies analysts added that Meta's "proven ability to successfully scale & monetize new products" added to their confidence in Meta's "new AI future." JPMorgan lifted its price objective for Meta's stock to $640 from $610, while Jefferies maintained its target of $600, representing about a 5.7% to 12.7% premium above Thursday's closing price of $567.84. Both targets were higher than the analyst consensus of $587.66 compiled by Visible Alpha, though all but one of the 31 analysts surveyed held a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Meta shares finished slightly lower Thursday after hitting a record intraday high earlier in the session. They've gained about 60% since the start of the year.

Season of Discovery Phase 5 allows players to venture into the Blackwing Lair and Zul’Gurub raid dungeons, collect new Tier 2 armor sets, and more— all waiting for you to discover. In the dark recesses of the mountain's peak, Nefarian, the eldest son of Deathwing, conducts some of his most awful experimentation, controlling mighty beings like puppets and combining the eggs of different dragonflights with horrific results. Should he prove successful, even darker pursuits rest on the horizon. Step into Blackwing Lair as a reimagined 20-40 player raid dungeon with a host of new mechanics including a swappable difficulty system allowing you to engage in greater challenges by activating new raid-wide effects based on each of the five dragonflight’s unique abilities. Leave no raider behind. Tuned as a 20-player encounter, players can bring additional friends to the adventure, with up to 40 players! As you make your way through the depths of the lair, keep a sharp eye out for some additional drops and their rewarding discoveries. Similar to Tier 1 sets from the Molten Core raid, Tier 2 armor sets are expanding to include multiple variations for different talent specializations and playstyles. The alternate versions of these new Tier 2 sets have new appearances and increased stats from the previous version of the Tier 2 sets and utilize Tier 1 set bonuses. This allows players more options to choose from when selecting the gear they would like to use while fine-tuning their playstyle. Players can also exchange Firelands Embers from the Blackrock Eruption event by visiting with Lokthos Darkbargainer in Blackrock Depths for elemental essences. Pix Xizzix now has additional new items such as Tier 2 bracer tokens for all classes available to purchase along with relics for druids, paladins, and shaman. Deep within the jungles of Stranglethorn, an ancient troll city full of untold peril awaits. Do you have what it takes to delve into its mysteries? Assemble a band of hardy explorers and make your way to Zul’Gurub, a max-level, up to 20-player raid instance with many epic items to procure from its verdant tree-lined avenues and lost temples. Zul’Gurub invites 10-20 players into this raid dungeon. Rewards and difficulty are tuned for 10, with room for 20 to join in the hunt for treasures untold. Players will be able to earn updated and redesigned rewards. Hakkar also offers new encounter mechanics and rewards for defeating him while all Zandalari Priests alive. Defeating Zandalari Priests now also grants access to buffs from powerful loa spirits like Hethiss and Shirvallah. Players will need to figure out the best route through Zul’Gurub to maximize the the effectiveness of these powerful spells. Players may also manually choose which boss they would like to face in the Edge of Madness Encounter. To fight a specific boss, click on their specific tablet and activate the brazier with Gurubashi Mojo Madness while the aura is active. In Season of Discovery Phase 5, many rune abilities have their discoveries streamlined to allow players to more easily complete those discoveries and obtain their runes. Pix Xizzix in Booty Bay now also makes bind-on-account tokens available for characters who have finished certain shared discoveries such as the Dark Riders, Wild Gods, Ley Lines, or Illari Duskfeather. Simply purchase the relevant emblem and mail it to an alt character to redeem at a special Rune Broker in Stormwind and Orgrimmar for their appropriate class rune. We have more discoveries for you to make in Phase 5, including new class-specific items for every class to find. For now, our lips are sealed on more details. The new phase ushers in additional Honor updates along with an increase to PvP ranks over time beginning with the release of Phase 5, allowing characters to continue earning ranks above rank 10, to a new cap of 13. Players earn more honor in battlegrounds along with gaining more honor with Marks of Honor turn-ins, and will earn slightly more Marks of Honor from losses in Warsong Gulch and Arathi basin. Queue restrictions for Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin are also removed, so that players can get into these battlegrounds faster. Season of Discovery Phase 5 adds a few other surprises in the form of a new raid boss and new dungeon boss, complete with all new loot! We look forward to seeing you engage with these new encounters. Good luck and may your blades never dull and your mana bar be plentiful!

Title: Bitcoin Peaks At Highest Value In 2 Months Above $65,000: Bull Run Predictions
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-peaks-at-highest-value-in-2-months-above-65000-bull-run-predictions/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T19:00:09Z
Full Content:
For the first time in nearly two months, Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the $65,000 mark, marking a significant recovery following two notable downturns in August and September. During these crashes, Bitcoin experienced a steep decline of 20% on two separate occasions, specifically on August 5 and September 6. However, as October approaches—a month often associated with a bullish resurgence for Bitcoin—market predictions are increasingly optimistic, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might be gearing up for another major uptrend. On Thursday, Bitcoin recorded a 3% increase within a 24-hour period, reaching a price of $65,500. This upward movement has sparked discussions among analysts about whether this signals the start of a parabolic bull run. Crypto investor Scott Melker expressed this sentiment, emphasizing that Bitcoin is currently attempting to establish its first higher high since peaking at $74,000 in March of this year. Melker noted that closing above $65,000 would confirm a new upward trend, transitioning from the lows of $50,000 observed in August. This pattern—a low, high, higher low, and higher high—suggests a bullish market structure replacing the previous bearish trends. Historically, October has been a strong month for Bitcoin, with analysts like Lark Davis pointing out that the average return during this month is approximately 22.90%. If Bitcoin were to experience a similar increase this year, it could potentially rise to around $79,000, surpassing its previous all-time high and overcoming key resistance levels. Such a move would set the stage for a powerful rally into November according to Davis’ analysis. In a further analysis, Rekt Capital provided insights into Bitcoin’s recent performance. He noted that September, often viewed negatively, turned out to be the best September for Bitcoin on record, with a 9% increase. Rekt also highlighted historical patterns related to Bitcoin’s Halving cycles, indicating that Bitcoin typically breaks out from its re-accumulation range approximately 154 to 163 days post-Halving. Currently, Bitcoin is 159 days past its last Halving that took place in April of this year. Based on previous cycles, Rekt believes that this timing suggests that a breakout could be imminent, reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin is well-positioned for significant gains in the near future. The current resurgence can be attributed to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) dovish stance and recent 0.50% basis point (bps) interest rate cut on September 18, which was seen as a notable bullish catalyst not only for BTC but also for the broader market, which has followed Bitcoin’s performance to the upside in recent days. In addition, last week saw a resumption of inflows into the Bitcoin ETF market, following steady outflows throughout August and early September. For instance, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had a total net inflow of $106 million on Wednesday, continuing their net inflows for 5 consecutive days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF had an inflow of $184 million. Overall, there seems to be a combination of bullish catalysts in place for the market’s largest cryptocurrency to continue its recovery, with massive gains expected in the last half of the year and early 2025.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg seems to have stuck the landing at Meta Connect

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg needed less than an hour to wow Wall Street. He took the stage at Meta Connect in a T-shirt dedicated to himself and delivered a keynote that Wall Street seems to be responding well to. In fact, his showing was a "massive flex" for Zuckerberg, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Zuckerberg introduced a new lineup of Meta Quest headsets, some impressive AI features coming to the company's smart glasses, and gave the public a glimpse of the highly anticipated Orion holographic glasses. He even managed to sneak in one of the many memes about his stylish new look. Meta's stock jumped more than 2%, though did even out in the day following his big announcements. Over the last year or so, Zuckerberg has shown that he's not the 20-something CEO who burst onto the scene with Facebook anymore. He's turned 40, stepped up his style, and has morphed into a Meta influencer on Instagram. His confidence appears to have paid off onstage Wednesday, Stratechery founder Ben Thompson remarked. He compared Zuck's spirited keynote to that of the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. "I thought Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered one of the best tech keynotes in years," Thompson wrote. That's saying something, considering 2024 has been all about the buzzy events from Big Tech. Still, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on X that Meta's stock fading after the keynote is likely because Orion is "years away and overall there was not much new from the event." And Thompson, who described the holographic glasses as "spectacular," gave a similar caveat. "The glasses that I tried felt like a consumer-ready product, but they reportedly cost $10,000 each, and Meta has decided to hold off on shipping a consumer version until they can bring the price down," Thompson said in a Thursday blog post. Consumers may not line up for $10,000 glasses, but reactions to Meta's vision of the future suggest they're open to a new tech frontier. A frontier that might include fewer smartphones and more chunky glasses. Jump to

Title: Where Is Amazon's Stock Price Heading In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/where-is-amazon-amzn-stock-price-heading-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:50:34Z
Full Content:
Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play. Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista: Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200. The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains. After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video. Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year. As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things. On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly. Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes—faster delivery, lower costs and broader selection—that can fuel sales growth. Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth. The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance. Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Elevate your journey by becoming a Forbes member. Unlock unlimited access to premium journalism plus exclusive members-only events gathering leading business minds that shape tomorrow. Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139. Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping. There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes. Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap. Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers—Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet—have deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest. The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon. According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include: Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings. The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%. In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth. Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories. The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20. Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025. Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63. Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio. Amazon's stock price in 2025 will be affected by its success in establishing AWS as the top platform choice for AI computing. Operational execution of the Project Kuiper satellite internet project may also sway investors to trade AMZN stock. Analysts generally see more upside in Amazon's stock price than Microsoft or Apple. Nvidia and Alphabet, however, are predicted to outpace Amazon over the next year. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. A quick settlement is not likely, so the suit may consume resources and be a major distraction for the e-commerce retailer and cloud provider. AWS is a key profit driver for Amazon, now and in the future. Over the last 12 months, AWS contributed 16% of Amazon's net sales and 60% of the company's operating income.

Title: Where Is Amazon's Stock Price Heading In 2025?

Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play. Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista: Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200. The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains. After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video. Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year. As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things. On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly. Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes—faster delivery, lower costs and broader selection—that can fuel sales growth. Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth. The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance. Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139. Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping. There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes. Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap. Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers—Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet—have deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest. The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon. According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include: Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings. The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%. In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth. Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories. The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20. Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025. Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63. Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio. Amazon's stock price in 2025 will be affected by its success in establishing AWS as the top platform choice for AI computing. Operational execution of the Project Kuiper satellite internet project may also sway investors to trade AMZN stock. Analysts generally see more upside in Amazon's stock price than Microsoft or Apple. Nvidia and Alphabet, however, are predicted to outpace Amazon over the next year. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. A quick settlement is not likely, so the suit may consume resources and be a major distraction for the e-commerce retailer and cloud provider. AWS is a key profit driver for Amazon, now and in the future. Over the last 12 months, AWS contributed 16% of Amazon's net sales and 60% of the company's operating income. Amazon is a good buy for long-term investors. The stock is volatile in the short term, but the diversification of Amazon's business model and brand recognition within multiple sectors are positives.

Full Content:
Saba Capital Management, L.P., a significant shareholder in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), has recently increased its stake in the company with the purchase of additional shares valued at over $312,000. The investment firm, known for its active management in closed-end funds, executed the buy transactions on September 24 and 25, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transactions involved the purchase of 9,482 shares at a price of $7.54 each, followed by an additional 31,988 shares at $7.52 per share. This price range reflects Saba Capital's continued confidence in the BlackRock-managed trust, which focuses on innovation and growth opportunities. Following these purchases, Saba Capital Management's holdings in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust have risen significantly. The firm's investment moves are closely watched by market participants, as Saba Capital is recognized for its strategic positions in the market. BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust, trading under the symbol NYSE:BIGZ, is a term trust that aims to provide growth and income to its investors by investing in a portfolio of equity securities. The trust's performance and management strategies have attracted the attention of institutional investors like Saba Capital Management. Investors and market observers often look to the buying and selling activities of major shareholders for insights into a stock's potential direction. The recent purchases by Saba Capital Management could be interpreted as a positive signal for the trust's future performance. The disclosure of these transactions provides transparency and allows investors to make informed decisions based on the actions of significant shareholders. As BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust continues to operate within the dynamic innovation sector, the investment decisions of firms like Saba Capital Management will remain under scrutiny for indications of market trends and confidence levels. In the wake of Saba Capital Management's increased stake in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), it's noteworthy to examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro that could shed light on the company's current market position and future prospects. With a market capitalization of $1.7 billion, BIGZ appears to be a sizeable player in the trust space. An attractive feature for investors is the trust's substantial dividend yield, which stands at 13.85% as of the last recorded date, indicating a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders. The trust's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently at 7.87, which may suggest that the stock is undervalued compared to industry peers, especially when coupled with a high dividend yield. This could be part of the rationale behind Saba Capital Management's recent share purchases. Additionally, the trust's performance over various time frames presents a mixed picture, with a one-week total return of -1.45%, but a more positive one-year total return of 23.71%, reflecting longer-term investor confidence. InvestingPro Tips for BIGZ indicate that while the trust pays a significant dividend to shareholders, it also suffers from weak gross profit margins and a valuation that implies a poor free cash flow yield. These insights might be particularly relevant for investors looking to balance the immediate income generation potential with the long-term financial health of the trust. For those interested in a deeper analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available for BIGZ, which can be accessed for further strategic investment considerations.

On Thursday, Baird reaffirmed its positive outlook on BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL), maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $65.00. The firm highlighted BlackLine as a bullish Fresh Pick, anticipating potential share price growth towards the end of the year. The optimism is partly based on the upcoming analyst day, which is expected to serve as a significant event for the company. The analyst day could reveal new medium- to long-term financial goals that may include an acceleration in revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion. These expectations are supported by recent industry checks which suggest a slight improvement in spending on financial suites and internal advancements within BlackLine. Baird's stance on BlackLine comes amid a cautious market sentiment, with the firm acknowledging that the company is not entirely "out of the woods." However, due to the current low expectations and valuation of the company's shares, Baird sees a path for upside potential. The firm's reiteration of the Outperform rating and price target reflects a belief in the company's ability to overcome present challenges. BlackLine's analyst day is being closely watched as a potential turning point for the company's financial trajectory and stock performance. In other recent news, BlackLine, Inc. reported a significant growth in its Q2 2024 earnings, with a revenue of $161 million and a non-GAAP net income of $43 million. The company's strategic product portfolio, particularly in consolidation and financial analytics, had a strong quarter. In addition, BlackLine appointed David Henshall to its Board of Directors, a move expected to strengthen the company's strategic direction and governance due to Henshall's extensive background in enterprise software and financial management. In terms of investment activity, Soros Capital Management sold off its stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), while Jana Partners established a new position in BlackLine Systems, owning nearly a 2% stake in the company. The Saudi Public Investment Fund added call positions in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), increasing the value of its U.S. stock holdings to roughly $20.7 billion. Looking ahead, BlackLine expects a total GAAP revenue for Q3 to be between $162 million and $164 million, indicating an 8% to 9% growth. These are the recent developments in the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives. As always, this information is based on the analysis of independent sources and does not contain personal opinions or predictions. As BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL) approaches its analyst day with Baird maintaining an Outperform rating, InvestingPro data underscores some financial metrics worth considering. The company's market capitalization stands at $3.15 billion, with a Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.66, indicating investor expectations of future earnings growth. Notably, BlackLine's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 has been 11.94%, reflecting a consistent upward trajectory in its financial performance. Two InvestingPro Tips that align with Baird's positive outlook include BlackLine's high shareholder yield and the expectation that net income will grow this year.

Title: A weight loss drug developer's stock soars after a $198 million IPO

Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:36:00Z

Shares of BioAge Labs (BIOA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on obesity drugs, opened 25% above its initial public offering (IPO) price on Thursday. The Richmond, California-based company set the price for its IPO at $18 a share Wednesday evening. The company aimed to raise nearly $200 million by offering 11 million shares at this price in an upsized IPO, according to a press release. BioAge initially said that it planned to only offer 7.5 million shares between $17 to $19 each. The company’s stock initially surged 24% to over $22 per share Thursday. It is trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “BIOA.” The IPO comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly’s has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors’ bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In an SEC filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their “high prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health” and “outsized commercial opportunities.” BioAge’s leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge’s IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Ethena debuts UStb stablecoin backed by BlackRock to complement USDe

Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:17:39Z
Full Content:
Share this article Ethena Labs, the startup behind the synthetic USDe dollar, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will be fully backed by BlackRock’s on-chain BUIDL fund. The move expands Ethena’s stablecoin offerings and aims to provide additional stability options for users and exchange partners. https://x.com/ethena_labs/status/1839259051030630757 UStb will function similarly to traditional stablecoins, with its reserves invested in BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The BUIDL fund itself holds US dollars, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, providing a stable backing for the new stablecoin. According to Ethena, UStb will exist as an independent product with a different risk profile compared to USDe. While USDe is a synthetic stablecoin that maintains its $1 peg through cash-and-carry arbitrage, UStb aims to offer a more traditional stablecoin structure backed by real-world assets. The company stated that UStb can support USDe during challenging market conditions. Ethena’s governance structure allows for the reallocation of backing assets from USDe to UStb when needed, potentially mitigating risks associated with negative funding rates. “UStb can also help USDe better weather difficult market conditions,” Ethena Labs claimed in a press release. “During periods of negative funding, the company can close hedging positions underlying USDe and reallocate its reserve assets to UStb.” Ethena plans to list UStb on centralized exchanges like Bybit and Bitget, where USDe is already used as margin collateral. The addition of UStb will provide exchange partners with a choice between two distinct products for margin collateral, potentially broadening the adoption of Ethena’s stablecoin solutions. Following the announcement, Ethena Labs’ ENA governance token experienced a significant price surge. Over the past 24 hours, ENA’s price increased by approximately 14%, climbing from $0.307 to $0.378. Trading volume also saw a notable uptick, reaching around $196.1 million. However, the market capitalization of USDe, Ethena’s flagship product, saw a slight decline of $13 million to $2.54 billion on the day of the announcement. This decrease comes after USDe had previously surpassed $3 billion in market cap in June. The introduction of UStb represents Ethena’s continued efforts to innovate in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The company aims to transform Ethereum into a crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin ecosystem that operates independently of the traditional banking system. Ethena’s approach involves leveraging delta-neutral strategies, on-chain custody, and derivatives to manage volatility and improve scalability and stability. The addition of UStb to its product lineup demonstrates the company’s commitment to providing diverse stablecoin options for users and exchange partners in varying market conditions. Earlier this month, Ethena suffered a frontend attack, although its team has confirmed that no funds were harmed or stolen, with the damage limited to its user interface.

Title: Baird raises Meta Platforms stock target on ad checks
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/baird-raises-meta-platforms-stock-target-on-ad-checks-93CH-3634792
Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:12:59Z

On Thursday, Baird, a financial services firm, updated its outlook on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), increasing the price target to $605 from the previous $530. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes after Baird's review of the company's advertising performance, which showed a positive trend, particularly in September when compared to August. The analyst from Baird expressed confidence in the near-term estimates for Meta Platforms, based on the Q3 advertising checks. The firm's decision to raise the 2025 growth target for Meta is attributed to steady macroeconomic trends and anticipated contributions from messaging, devices, and AI-driven platform enhancements. These factors are expected to bolster the company's growth trajectory. Despite projecting slightly lower operating margins than the consensus due to anticipated higher networking and depreciation costs associated with infrastructure development, Baird's revised price target is based on sector multiples that align with the industry. The firm believes this new target offers a substantial upside potential for Meta Platforms. Baird's analysis indicates that while the firm anticipates increased costs in building out Meta's infrastructure, the overall outlook remains positive. This is due to the company's robust advertising checks and the expected growth from new initiatives and enhancements to the platform. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has seen a price target increase to $640 from JPMorgan, emphasizing the company's advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Meta's AI, with substantial user engagement, is projected to become the world's most-used AI assistant by 2024. The company's significant investment in AI and the Metaverse, despite substantial projected losses, is backed by its strong operating results and early benefits of AI in user engagement and monetization. Oppenheimer maintains an Outperform rating for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., despite Meta's unveiling of its lightweight AR glasses prototype, Orion, which has not posed a significant threat to Apple's rumored Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, Citi maintains a Buy rating for Meta, highlighting the company's potential in AI innovation. JMP Securities has also raised its price target for Meta, lauding the company's AI-powered Orion glasses as revolutionary. Meta is also actively engaging with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act, though it has chosen not to immediately join the European Union's AI Pact. In a move towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits, marking a significant step towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2030. As Baird sets a higher price target for Meta Platforms Inc., investors might find the real-time metrics from InvestingPro to be a valuable addition to the analysis. With a substantial market capitalization of $1.44 trillion, Meta's financial health and market position are critical to understanding its potential. The company's P/E ratio stands at a competitive 28.42, indicating a reasonable valuation relative to its earnings. Moreover, the adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 is slightly lower at 26.66, which could signal a favorable investment opportunity when paired with the company's near-term earnings growth. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's perfect Piotroski Score of 9, reflecting strong financial conditions, and the fact that the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility. These factors, combined with Meta's impressive gross profit margins of 81.49%, underscore the company's efficiency in generating income relative to its revenue. Additionally, Meta is trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 9.17, which investors may interpret as a sign of the company's robust assets and growth potential. For those interested in further insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips, providing a comprehensive outlook on Meta's financial health and market prospects. With the next earnings date slated for October 23, 2024, market participants will be keen to see if Meta's performance aligns with Baird's positive projections and whether the company can sustain its momentum in the competitive Interactive Media & Services industry.

Title: Elliott Management Buying Miami Office Tower for $450M
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/09/paul-singer-elliott-management-nuveen-real-estate-tiaa-701-brickell/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:09:36Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, a hedge fund known for its aggressive activist tactics, is diving deep into office real estate, going into contract for $450 million to buy an office tower in Miami’s financial district, Bloomberg reported. The building, 701 Brickell, is home to some of the biggest names in finance, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock and Point72 Asset Management. Last year, Pura Vida, a popular fast-casual chain, opened a 5,000-square-foot cafe on the ground floor. In April, Nuveen Real Estate put 701 Brickell up for sale, seeking $500 million. JLL is brokering the sale of the 32-story high-rise. The New York-based investor purchased the 1.1 million-square-foot tower for $172 million in 2002, according to property records. If the deal closes, it would mark Miami’s largest office sale this year. In 2023, Nuveen sold 801 Brickell, a nearby office property, for $250 million. Elliott Management, which moved its headquarters from New York to West Palm Beach in 2020, has been making inroads in Miami real estate this year. The firm and Adi Chugh launched Tyko Capital, which has emerged as one of the city’s largest lenders in recent months, providing $565 million to refinance the 830 Brickell office building and $527 million to build the St. Regis-branded luxury condo complex, also in Brickell. The district’s office asking rents — which average $93.73 per square foot, the highest in Miami-Dade County — have jumped since the pandemic hit, thanks to a slew of high-profile, new-to-market companies that set up shop. Asking rents also got a boost from the arrival of 830 Brickell, which is nearing completion and set a new benchmark for rates. Representatives for Nuveen and Elliott Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Julia Echikson can be reached at jechikson@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Why Zach Lowe's million-dollar contract led to his exit from ESPN

Editions: En/basketball/nba ESPN cuts ties with Zach Lowe Zach Lowe is a well-known figure in the basketball world, celebrated for his sharp analysis and insightful commentary on the NBA. As a senior writer for ESPN, he built a reputation over his more than ten years with the network, having first joined Bill Simmons' Grantland in 2012. Lowe's journey through the world of sports journalism has been marked by his keen understanding of the game, as well as his ability to break down complex strategies in a way that fans can appreciate. He also hosted the popular Lowe Post podcast and frequently appeared on NBA Today, making him a familiar face to basketball enthusiasts everywhere. Unfortunately, the latest buzz in sports media reveals that Lowe is no longer with ESPN. According to Andrew Marchand from The Athletic, Lowe's dismissal was part of a wave of layoffs that has recently hit the network, which also saw notable departures like Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder just before the football season kicked off. Reports suggest that Lowe's salary-over a million dollars a year-was a significant factor in the decision to let him go. As one insider noted, "His salary was the biggest factor in his dismissal from ESPN," highlighting the tough choices networks face in today's changing media landscape. Despite this setback, there might be a silver lining for Lowe. With NBC and Amazon ramping up their NBA coverage in anticipation of new rights agreements in 2025, opportunities could be on the horizon. Both networks are keen to bring in top-notch talent, and Lowe's experience and credibility in the field make him a prime candidate for their future plans. Interestingly, this shake-up in the sports media world comes on the heels of a surprising announcement from another basketball luminary, Adrian Wojnarowski. Woj, ESPN's lead NBA reporter, revealed his departure to become the general manager of St. Bonaventure's men's basketball team. In a heartfelt message posted on X, he shared, "This craft transformed my life," expressing his appreciation for the journey that sports journalism has taken him on. As for Lowe, while the road ahead may seem uncertain, his contributions to the NBA discourse have been invaluable, and his passion for the game will surely lead him to new and exciting ventures. The basketball community will be watching closely to see where this talented writer lands next. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us

We provide what many… More Info Kazakhstan has defended the country's second-largest lender as being "fully" compliant with sanctions against Russia after a scathing report saw around 20 percent wiped off the Nasdaq-listed Kaspi.kz's stock price. A September 19 report published by Culper Research poured doubt on the claim by fintech giant Kaspi that it lacks exposure to sanctions-struck Russia and raised concerns about the group's past affiliations to a relative of former President Nursultan Nazarbaev who was convicted by a Kazakh court of major embezzlement in 2022. In a September 19 statement, Kaspi.kz called Culper's report "misleading" and "inaccurate." The report, Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money For Criminals And Kleptocrats, focused on Kaspi.kz's issuance of bank cards to Russians, tens of thousands of whom arrived in Kazakhstan in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. "As the U.S. and other nations continue to broaden sanctions against those found to be aiding Russia's wartime economy, we believe Kaspi now risks secondary sanctions," the report warned, justifying its "short" position on the company. Kaspi.kz is widely viewed as a success story in Kazakhstan, going from a relatively obscure bank to the country's leader in mobile payments and online marketplace services in some 20 years. SEE ALSO: In a September 23 statement, Kazakhstan's Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets called Kaspi "one of the country's systemically important and steadily developing banks, demonstrating sustainable growth and a high level of transparency." "The bank fully complies with the sanctions regime of the U.S., the European Union, and other foreign countries," the agency said, referring to the sanctions imposed on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main shareholders in Kaspi.kz are Kazakh billionaire Vyacheslav Kim, Georgia-born Mikhail Lomtadze, and Baring Funds, part of a Commonwealth of Independent States-focused private equity investor. Kaspi.kz listed in 2020 on the London Stock Exchange to become the its largest international tech public offering that year. In January it joined the Nasdaq in an initial public offering that saw the business valued at $17.5 billion. "Being the first company from Kazakhstan to successfully list on Nasdaq has obviously raised our profile amongst short sellers," Kaspi.kz said in its statement. Nazarbaev's nephew, Kairat Satybaldy, who once held a stake of around 30 percent in Kaspi, exited the company prior to the successful listings. In August, Lomtadze, who is CEO of Kaspi.kz, declared the company's intention to compete in the forthcoming privatization of Humo, neighboring Uzbekistan's state-backed payment system. In May, Lomtadze was revealed as the new owner of Wycombe Wanderers, a third-tier English soccer club.

Title: Volatile Month for Nvidia Stock Continues

Time Published: 2024-09-26T17:57:54Z
Full Content:
The volatile month for shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued Thursday, as the stock surged in early trading only to slip into negative territory in the afternoon. The chip-maker’s shares, the year’s second-best performers in the S&P 500, rose more than 3% in the opening minutes of Thursday's session to trade near $127. That put them substantially above the roughly $119 at which they finished August, marking a recovery from September intraday lows near $101. In recent trading, however, the stock was down about 0.2% near $123, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also came off their earlier highs. The early move Thursday came as earnings from Micron (MU), a Nvidia partner, came in better than expected, sending chip stocks higher across the board. Micron pointed to "robust AI demand" as it issued a rosy revenue outlook. Bank of America analysts in a Thursday note said Micron’s results pointed to “a positive read-across” for Nvidia and other semi stocks. Wall Street analysts are still broadly bullish on Nvidia’s shares. Nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the stock have “buy” ratings on it, according to Visible Alpha data, while their mean price target of $152.52 represents a more than 20% premium to Wednesday’s closing price. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week reported the conclusion of a planned sale of some $700 million in company stock.

Title: Amazon Employees Are Overwhelmingly ‘Dissatisfied’ With CEO Andy Jassy’s RTO Mandate

Time Published: 2024-09-26T17:49:07Z
Full Content:
The majority of Amazon (AMZN) employees are overwhelmingly unhappy with CEO Andy Jassy’s new return-to-office (RTO) mandate and are considering looking for new jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by Team Blind, an anonymous social platform for verified tech workers. A poll of more than 2,500 Amazon employees found that 91 percent are “dissatisfied” with the new five-day in-office policy, which will come into effect in January 2025. “My morale for this job is gone,” one said in a post. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Like most other tech companies, Amazon embraced remote work during the pandemic and has since reverted to a three-day in-office policy. Now, in an effort to rebuild the company’s culture and boost collaboration, Jassy’s RTO measure will only allow employees to work from home under extenuating circumstances like illnesses. The change will help ensure Amazon operates “like the world’s largest startup,” according to the CEO. Amazon employees don’t appear to share Jassy’s sentiments. Blind’s survey was conducted between Sept. 17 (a day after Jassy announced the RTO mandate) to Sept. 19 and found that three quarters of polled workers are considering looking for another job because of the new policy, while 32 percent said they know someone who has quit recently in response to Jassy’s mandate. Amazon’s HR is scrambling to fill the void. “I just had an Amazon recruiter blow up my phone and inbox five times in the last 24 hours to get me to provide my availability for an onsite interview,” said a Microsoft (MSFT) employee on Blind, adding that the recruiter said hiring managers are frustrated by the amount of Amazon candidates who have dropped out of interview processes in response to the news. For Amazon employees who were hired remotely, some are viewing the mandate as a thinly veiled strategy to cut headcount. The company’s workforce reportedly surged by nearly 75 percent between March 2020 and September 2021 alone. “Many of those folks are concerned that they don’t live anywhere close to an office, and they were hired with the expectation of being remote,” Rick Chen, Blind’s head of public relations, told Observer. Only a small percentage of employees are okay with RTO, with 9 percent saying they are “satisfied” with Jassy’s mandate. “There were some defenders of the policy, folks that prefer to work in the office and disliked remote work,” said Chen, who noted that a few Amazon employees also suggested that the end of remote work was caused by a few “bad apples'” who “ruined it for everyone by taking quiet vacations or slacking off.” Another trending response to Amazon’s RTO policy is concern amongst other Big Tech workers that their company is next. In addition to worried employees from Apple (AAPL), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL), all of which also currently have a three-day in-office policy, Microsoft professionals—who are allowed to work remotely 50 percent of the time—have overwhelmingly voiced concerns that Microsoft will follow Amazon’s lead, according to Chen. This could be due to a geographic connection, as both Amazon and Microsoft are based near Seattle, Wash., he said. Such comments echo those made in 2022 and 2023 when large tech companies announced layoffs one after the other, said Chen. “The was a feeling among professionals then, and it’s resurfacing now, that these companies are moving in lockstep with one another.” Blind has noticed an unusual uptick in search volume for the term “RTO” since Jassy’s announcement. While the phrase was previously searched by 500 employees on a daily basis at the beginning of 2024, that figure has since doubled this month to 1,000, Chen said. Other keywords like “remote work” and “flexible work” have also gained popularity in lieu of previously common search terms like “layoffs,” “manager” and “promotion.” “It’s a very extreme shift in terms of what is capturing Amazon professionals’ mind space right now,” said Chen.

Title: ESPN lays off NBA reporter Zach Lowe over seven-figure salary
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/sports/espn-lays-off-nba-reporter-zach-lowe-over-seven-figure-salary/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T16:57:32Z

Another high-profile talent is out at ESPN. Senior NBA writer Zach Lowe has been laid off by the network, The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand reported. Lowe had been with ESPN for more than a decade, having joined Bill Simmons’ Grantland vertical in 2012 after writing for Sports Illustrated. Lowe was one of the few Grantland writers who made the transition over to ESPN when the vertical shuttered in 2015; NFL writer Bill Barnwell was another. Lowe’s salary, more than $1 million a year, was the “biggest factor” in his dismissal from ESPN, according to The Athletic. In addition to writing for ESPN, Lowe regularly appeared on “NBA Today”, the network’s daily NBA program, and hosted the popular “Lowe Post” podcast. Lowe’s exit from ESPN follows the shocking layoffs of Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder, which happened last month, right before football season. A silver lining for Lowe is that the timing lines up as NBC and Amazon are stocking up on NBA talents before their league rights agreements start in 2025 (Amazon’s package is presuming TNT’s lawsuit against the NBA is unsuccessful or settled). The Lowe news follows last week’s stunner that ESPN’s lead NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski left the company to be the general manager of his alma mater St. Bonaventure’s men’s basketball team. “I grew up the son of a factory worker two miles from ESPN’s campus and only ever dreamed of making a living as a sportswriter,” Wojnarowski wrote on X when he announced the news. “Thirty-seven years ago, the Hartford Courant gave me my first byline and I never stopped chasing the thrill of it all.” “This craft transformed my life, but I’ve decided to retire from ESPN and the news industry. I understand the commitment required in my role and it’s an investment that I’m no longer driven to make. Time isn’t in endless supply and I want to spend mine in ways that are more personally meaningful.”

[+] with the interest rate cuts bitcoin traders had bet on. Bitcoin options interest "has been building mostly around the round figure of $100,000," Geoffrey Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered, wrote in an emailed comments. "Notably the build out has come at a more rapid pace than can be explained just by the fact that bitcoin prices are higher. Indeed the jump in open interest at the $100,000 strike that has come this week indicates something else is driving participants." The bitcoin price rally comes after U.S. vice president and 2024 Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris said that if she wins the White House in November, she would "encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting our consumers and investors," according to a Bloomberg report of a Wall Street fundraiser. "The most likely, from a timing perspective, is vice president Harris' comments on Sunday where she said she would encourage crypto businesses. These comments suggest either outcome on 5 November will end up being bitcoin positive," Kendrick wrote, pointing to the bitcoin and crypto market leading "the pack in terms of performance for the first time in a while" following the Fed's historical interest rate cut last week as evidence of growing positive sentiment. Kendrick has predicted the bitcoin price will surge to $125,000 per bitcoin if former U.S. president Donald Trump wins the election but will still climb to $75,000 if Harris wins. Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, promising to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve if he's elected and backing his a crypto project led by his sons Don Jr and Eric. "A Harris victory would likely trigger an initial price decline, but we would expect dips to be bought as the market recognizes that progress on the regulatory front will still be forthcoming, and as other positive drivers take hold," Kendrick wrote in an emailed note earlier this month.

Harris' muted endorsement of crypto failed to spur much support from the crypto community, with Galaxy Research's Alex Thorne posting to X that he doesn't "see any material difference from Harris (or her advisor Brian Nelson a few weeks ago) that offers cause for celebration." However, some welcomed the statement as a step forward. "Progress is progress, it needs to start somewhere, and should be encouraged.

Title: ESPN Laid Off Zach Lowe In Latest Shakeup To Their NBA Coverage

Time Published: 2024-09-26T16:33:47Z

In the past year-plus, ESPN has made some massive changes to their NBA coverage team. A year ago, Jalen Rose, Jeff Van Gundy, and Mark Jackson were all let go as part of company-wide layoffs. Doc Rivers stepped in to the lead booth along with Doris Burke but left for the Bucks head coaching job midseason. JJ Redick was elevated into Rivers’ spot, but promptly took the Lakers job at the end of the season. Most recently, the league’s top newsbreaker, Adrian Wojnarowski, announced his shocking retirement to go work for his beloved alma mater, St. Bonaventure. With Woj already gone, another bomb dropped on Thursday when The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand brought word that ESPN was also laying off its top NBA writer and podcaster, Zach Lowe. Per Marchand, Lowe being let go falls in line with the Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder departures earlier this year, as Lowe made north of seven figures annually and was fired for budget reasons. Lowe was the most prominent NBA writer not only on ESPN’s staff, but arguably in the entire league. Beyond his written work, Lowe’s podcast, The Lowe Post, has been extremely popular and he has been a regular contributor on TV with NBA Today and other studio shows. Lowe had been at ESPN for more than a decade, starting his career at Grantland and then moving over to the dot com after they shuttered the Bill Simmons-led site. As such, many would expect the Ringer to be a potential landing spot for Lowe, who immediately becomes the most sought after free agent in the NBA writing and podcasting space. He also could be in play for NBC and Amazon, as they both get set to be new national broadcast partners of the NBA in 2025-26. As for ESPN, they are now tasked with not only reshaping their NBA coverage on the TV side, still needing to figure out their lead booth and the potential domino effect that will have on their other game broadcasts, but also their written coverage with Lowe and Woj both gone.

Title: Aid to Ukraine is Hurting Europe. Irresponsible Pro-Ukrainian EU Trade Policy Destroying Bulgarian Agribusiness. European Farmers Going Bankrupt
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/pro-ukrainian-trade-policy-destroying-bulgarian-agribusiness/5868745

The irresponsible policy of aid to Ukraine is hurting Europe in every possible way. It is not only the arms shipments that are causing harm to EU nations, but also the current trade rules that prioritize Ukrainian products in order to expand “economic cooperation” with Kiev. Farmers’ dissatisfaction is only going to get worse and worse, paving the way for a major crisis in the future. Bulgaria has begun to show its dissatisfaction with the EU’s pro-Ukrainian trade policies. The country’s government has asked the European Commission to adopt a new resolution proposing to ban Ukrainian chicken eggs from the European market. The measure is intended to protect the European market from cheap Ukrainian products, ensuring the participation of native farmers in the commercial competition. Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Georgi Tahov said during a meeting with the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels that Bulgarian farmers are having severe difficulties competing with Ukrainian products, as the latter have “invaded” the European market at low prices and in massive quantities. This not only jeopardizes the economic stability of the Bulgarian agricultural sector, but also threatens to bankrupt thousands of farmers, leading to unemployment and social crises. Ukrainian eggs are causing controversy and are a particularly sensitive topic in the current European scenario. Egg production is one of the main activities of Bulgarian farmers, who have always had strong support from the state and the local market to maintain stable production levels. However, since the beginning of the special military operation, the EU has adopted an irresponsible policy of easy import of Ukrainian products with the alleged aim of boosting Kiev’s economy. As a result, Ukrainian eggs, which are 30% cheaper than Bulgarian ones, have simply “invaded” the European market. Ukraine exported more than 2,600 tons of eggs in the first half of 2024 alone. This figure is already five times higher than in the corresponding period last year, and an even greater rise is expected for the coming months. As a result, Bulgarian poultry producers are going bankrupt, and a big number of farmers are abandoning their activities due to lack of profit. “[This situation] puts serious pressure on prices on the domestic market (…) We firmly support the people of Ukraine, but this should in no way cause bankruptcies and violate the rights of our farmers,” the Bulgarian minister said. This is not the first time that demands have been made for changes in European import policy for Ukrainian goods. Since 2022, there has been strong pressure from European farmers to review the rules that facilitate the purchase of Ukrainian food products. Just as the Bulgarian egg sector is being affected, producers of grains, meat, milk and other items are going bankrupt in several European countries. The crisis affects countries from the most eastern areas, such as Poland and Bulgaria, to the most Western, such as the Netherlands, Germany and France. Farmers across the entire European continent are suffering from the EU’s irresponsible attitude of favoring Ukraine. The strong protests by farmers have led to expectations of changes in the trade situation. A report published by the Financial Times in June predicted that the bloc would resume tax obligations on Ukrainian products. However, the current tax exemption rules will remain in place until at least the second half of next year – which is enough time to bankrupt thousands of European farmers. In the same vein, it is unlikely that the European Commission will approve the Bulgarian request, given that most European officials are currently in favor of maintaining all policies supporting Ukraine, no matter how irresponsible they are. For the EU, the impact of anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian policies on European citizens is not important. The only thing that really matters is maintaining the levels of aid to Kiev, regardless of the consequences. It must also be emphasized that this process is a real “ticking timebomb” for the entire European food stability. While European farmers are going bankrupt to favor Ukrainian agribusiness, Ukrainian arable land itself is being handed over to Western private investment funds, such as Blackrock, as a method of payment for NATO’s billion-dollar support. In a few years, Europe will not be able to count on either its own production or Ukrainian products, entering a major supply crisis and dependence on imports – while having to impose sanctions that limit imports. Consciously or not, EU decision-makers are creating a problem that will not be solved so easily. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Solana and Ethereum: How These Cryptocurrencies Stack Up In 2024, Part 1 In 2008, Bitcoin Bitcoin was introduced as the world's first provably secure peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Ethereum Ethereum , announced in 2014, built on Bitcoin’s vision by allowing developers to create their own decentralized applications on a blockchain. Solana Solana , conceived in 2017, was built to address Web3’s scalability challenges, enabling high throughput and low-latency transaction processing at scale. Both Etheruem and Solana have been built to solve problems faced by the previous generation of blockchain technology. Both have also gone from zero to one in bringing new infrastructure to market, unlocking novel use cases, and driving adoption across Main Street and Wall Street alike. But how does one protocol compare to the other in 2024? Today, let’s look at how Ethereum and Solana stack up across three categories: institutional adoption, scalability, and liquidity. Institutional Adoption In 2024, institutional adoption has been driven in part by newly introduced crypto exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S, providing a regulated and accessible way for investors to add digital assets to their portfolios. Most recently, Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, with funds from major institutions such as Blackrock and Grayscale. This followed the successful launch of eleven Bitcoin ETFs in January, after approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By August, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust was the first to surpass $1 billion in net inflows. The debut of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has paved the way for a potential Solana ETF. Solana ETFs are not currently listed in the U.S., although they are available in some international markets. There are, however, applications under review by the SEC, with VanEck being the first American company to file for a U.S. Solana ETF, and 21Shares also submitting an application. It has been reported that the SEC rejected the 19b-4 filings submitted by Cboe BZX on behalf of the two institutions, raising a question around the deadline for an ultimate decision on a Solana ETF. Staking is notably excluded from Ethereum ETFs, leading some to believe a Solana ETF would follow suit, Solana also being a Proof of Stake blockchain. If so, this would indirectly transfer value to those who stake both SOL and ETH through each respective protocol’s inflation rate, meaning those who self-stake or choose to stake with a third party would receive more value from their staking. Scalability Both Ethereum and Solana pursue a vastly different, yet equally ambitious, scalability roadmap. Today, the Ethereum network faces throughput limits, with transactions ranging from 15-30 per second (TPS). These transactions are bundled into blocks, which are then processed by validators. Ethereum scalability relies on a strong Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, a roadmap it has pursued since 2020. In March 2024, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade was launched, introducing proto danksharding and dramatically reducing fees for L2s. These L2s, such as Optimism Optimism and Arbitrum Arbitrum , are separate blockchains, fully compatible with Ethereum, that take transaction load off the main network. L2 solutions have grown in popularity due to their high speeds and low fees, with institutions, such as Kraken, Sony, and Coinbase, as notable examples looking towards L2s for a number of use cases. Solana is faster than Ethereum, with a theoretical max of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), and it aims to be even quicker. Yet historically, Solana’s mainnet has had to overcome some uptime challenges. Firedancer, a Solana validator client built by Jump Trading, aims to deliver up to a theoretical TPS that is orders of magnitude higher, while improving reliability. Built from the ground up, Firedancer uses a concurrency model, borrowed from the low latency trading space, with high performance implementations of Solana’s core primitives. Firedancer’s testnet, Frankendancer, is a combination of Agave, developed by Solana Labs, and Firedancer. At this year’s Solana Breakpoint, Frankendancer was announced as live on mainnet, with Firedancer live on testnet. Liquidity Liquidity is important for an efficient Web3 economy, as it determines how quickly assets can be traded without impacting price. Trading volumes on Solana have historically been much lower than Ethereum, by a factor of 2 or more. However the speed and low-fee properties of Solana has led to a recent catch up, when Solana trading volumes briefly surpassed Ethereum (July and August 2024). Both ecosystems see real-world use cases and tokenization, particularly with stablecoins which are prime trading assets, has strong drivers for increased liquidity. Staking also impacts the levels of liquidity in both Ethereum and Solana, as both ETH and SOL require tokens to be locked in order to stake. Today, only 28% of the overall supply of ETH is staked, yet liquid staking has claimed the top spot in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. Liquid staking provides stakers with a Liquid Staking Token (LST) of their assets, one which is available to hold, trade, or participate in DeFi. The availability of liquid staking solutions is key to Ethereum’s economy: without a centralized marketplace, buyers and sellers must provide liquidity in pools to allow for assets to be bought, sold, and swapped across DEXes and DeFi platforms. Liquid staking providers, such as Liquid Collective, allow greater capital efficiency for stakers wishing to receive rewards, while also giving them the liquidity to participate in Ethereum DeFi. Similarly, liquid staking has become the largest portion of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, yet lags behind Ethereum significantly. The total market cap of staked Solana tokens is $57B. However, the market cap for liquid staking tokens is $3.8B, a liquid staking ratio of 6.60%. Conclusion While Ethereum holds a lead in terms of deeper liquidity, institutional trust, and a thriving L2 ecosystem, Solana’s momentum as a high-performance L1 is clear. Ethereum is building an increasingly modular stack, while Solana believes in the highly optimized, monolithic structure. The institutional confidence in ETH as an asset is highlighted by the recent introduction of ETFs, and initiatives such as the recently introduced Node Operator Risk Standard (NORS) certification establishes an objective benchmark of excellence for professional Ethereum node operators. But Solana’s achievements, and future potential, cannot be understated. Solana is actively scaling its mainnet infrastructure, creating a superhighway for future growth without fragmenting liquidity across L2s. Furthermore, Solana’s institutional interest has been signaled by a number of major players, including Franklin Templeton. While Ethereum’s advantage as a first mover is evident, both networks will play important roles in shaping the future of finance in both 2024 and beyond.

Title: Binance CEO Richard Teng on Navigating Crypto Regulation and Accelerating Adoption
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/09/binance-ceo-richard-teng-on-navigating-crypto-regulation-and-accelerating-adoption/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T15:21:57Z
Full Content:
In a candid interview on CoinDesk TV, Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, opened up about his role at the world’s largest crypto exchange, the company’s relationship with global regulators, and his outlook on the future of cryptocurrency adoption. Over the course of the discussion, Teng shared insights into the challenges and successes Binance has faced, his commitment to innovation, and the broader implications of crypto’s evolution. Since taking on the role of CEO at Binance, Teng has been focused on building a robust and compliant platform for its 220 million users worldwide. Teng noted that Binance has made significant strides in expanding its presence and gaining regulatory approvals across multiple jurisdictions, including Indonesia, India, Kazakhstan, Thailand, and Dubai. Reflecting on the company’s journey, Teng emphasized that Binance’s primary mission is to support the “freedom of money” and foster a vibrant blockchain ecosystem. He acknowledged the challenges Binance faced when he took over, such as regulatory fines, but emphasized that the platform’s strong foundation and user trust, built over seven years, have allowed it to continue thriving. Teng was clear in addressing the regulatory hurdles Binance has faced, particularly the skepticism from global regulators. He highlighted that the regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically in the last few years, with more countries enacting clearer frameworks for cryptocurrency. As a former financial services regulator himself, Teng understands the importance of balancing innovation with risk mitigation. He stressed that regulation should not be one-dimensional and must support both the protection of users and the growth of the crypto sector. In terms of the broader industry, Teng mentioned that crypto has been misunderstood by regulators and the public alike. He urged policymakers to better educate themselves about blockchain technology and the benefits of cryptocurrencies. According to Teng, the perception that crypto is primarily used for illicit activities is outdated, with the actual amount of crypto-related money laundering being minuscule compared to traditional fiat currencies. One of the most significant developments Teng highlighted is the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency. He described 2024 as a landmark year for crypto adoption, with increasing regulatory clarity and institutions like BlackRock moving from crypto skepticism to advocacy. Teng believes that institutional involvement is critical to driving mainstream adoption, marking a pivotal shift in how cryptocurrencies are perceived by traditional financial institutions. According to Teng, the rapid growth in Binance’s user base is a testament to the increasing pace of crypto adoption. The platform gained its first 100 million users in five years, the second 100 million in just two years, and Teng expects the next 100 million users to come even faster. Binance remains committed to supporting this accelerated growth by continuously improving its products and services. Security and compliance are two of Binance’s top priorities, according to Teng. He noted that Binance’s compliance spending has increased significantly, with $230 million allocated in 2023, up from $158 million the previous year. Binance has also invested heavily in expanding its compliance team, with over 500 staff dedicated to ensuring regulatory adherence. In terms of security, Teng discussed the importance of protecting users’ assets and highlighted the company’s efforts in recovering funds lost to scams and fraud. Binance has helped users recover $73 million in stolen funds in 2023 alone. The company also maintains a $1 billion insurance fund (the SAFU Fund) to safeguard users’ assets in the event of a security breach. Teng touched on one of the biggest challenges facing the crypto industry: the lack of global regulatory harmony. Different jurisdictions treat cryptocurrencies differently—some as commodities, others as securities or payment tokens. This inconsistency makes it difficult for companies like Binance to operate seamlessly across borders. Teng advocated for a global regulatory framework that could streamline compliance and protect users more effectively. However, Teng acknowledged that achieving such a framework would require significant political will and collaboration among regulators. Despite the challenges, he remains optimistic that, as the industry matures, there will be greater convergence toward standardized regulations. When asked about his personal journey into the crypto space, Teng recalled how he first encountered cryptocurrency in 2017, a time when institutional investors were not involved in the space. He admitted that he never imagined himself leading Binance, given his background in traditional finance and regulation, but his belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology ultimately drew him into the industry. Looking forward, Teng is bullish about the future of cryptocurrency. He envisions rapid growth in adoption and continued technological advancements, particularly in areas like asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). His goal is to position Binance at the forefront of these developments while maintaining the company’s commitment to security, compliance, and user protection. As for challenges, Teng acknowledged that crypto is a highly dynamic industry where new obstacles arise daily. However, he remains focused on sustainable growth and ensuring that Binance continues to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape.

CEO Satya Nadella highlighted a plan to invest in Mexico over the next three years to build its AI and Cloud infrastructure. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is doubling down on its cloud computing and artificial intelligence investment. Earlier this week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the company's plan to invest up to $1.3 billion over the next three years to build its infrastructure in Mexico to foster these advances. The tech giant plans to use its $1.3 billion investment to enhance broad adoption of AI technology across small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Microsoft aspires to reach up to 5 million Mexicans and 30,000 SMBs in three years through the initiative. This happens as OpenAI just unveiled OpenAI Academy — the program is designed to make generative AI more accessible to developers across low and middle-income countries with up to $1 million in API credits. According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: “We are entering a new era of AI with the promise to create inclusive economic growth and opportunity across every role, industry, and country, including in Mexico. Our investments in AI infrastructure and skilling in Mexico will help ensure people and organizations across the country realize the benefits of this technology shift.” Microsoft marks 38-years in Mexico with companies like Grupo Bimbo, Tec de Monterrey and Cemex onboard its AI train. With its new initiative, the tech giant hopes to address emerging health concerns, connectivity issues and promote sustainability as part of its broader plans to become a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company. It's apparent that it takes an arm and a leg to keep AI operations running. For instance, OpenAI spends up to $700,000 to keep ChatGPT running. Still, the payoff isn't allowing the AI firm to break even. Reports hitting mainstream media indicate that the ChatGPT maker could be on the brink of bankruptcy, with projections of $5 billion in losses over the next year. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. However, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple will reportedly participate in the firm's latest round of funding to keep its operations afloat, pushing its market cap well beyond $150 billion. Market analysts and experts are confident that OpenAI will become the world's dominant AI company, further citing that it's in a unique consumer and enterprise position. Incidentally, Microsoft is having the same issues, with some of its investors raising concerns over its high expenditure on AI projects, citing its difficult to establish a clear path toward profitability in the category. Last year, the tech giant partnered with OpenAI and invested $100 billion in a project dubbed Stargate to free themselves from an overdependence on NVIDIA for AI chips. Similarly, the company recently partnered with BlackRock to raise $100 billion to 'emancipate themselves from the shackles' of insufficient power and increase data centers for their ambitious AI dreams.

Title: BlackRock report adds fuel to debate over Bitcoin price correlations, calling it “unique diversifier”
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/26/blackrock-report-adds-fuel-to-debate-over-bitcoin-price-correlations-calling-it-unique-diversifier/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T14:28:05Z
Full Content:
As investors seek ways to harness Bitcoin’s volatile and often unpredictable nature, BlackRock argues that Bitcoin’s prices may be uncorrelated to stocks and other traditional assets in a new report. The authors call Bitcoin a “unique diversifier” because its behavior is difficult to analyze within traditional economic frameworks. While Bitcoin prices may correlate with established markers like the S&P 500 in the short-term, the report says, they often rally higher than others over time. “We view this pattern as instances of fundamentals eventually prevailing over short-term leveraged trading reactions,” the report said. Iván Rodríguez, an associate professor of finance at Eastern Michigan University, has come to a similar conclusion in his own research. “There are periods where the correlation seems to be really high and these periods where these correlations kind of decouple, like the correlation disappears, or it’s negative,” he said. “So when you look over the long-term it seems like they’re uncorrelated.” Rodríguez points to a concept called intermarket flows to explain why Bitcoin and other traditional assets tend to correlate in the short-term. During times of volatility, an investor might choose to sell S&P 500 and invest in Bitcoin or vice versa. “So it can induce a negative correlation. It can induce a positive correlation,” Rodríguez said. “But those decisions that I’m making, or the market’s making on aggregate, that’s going to drive prices.” As its proponents like to point out,, Bitcoin is decentralized, open-source and detached from fiat-currencies and major geopolitical risks. Because of this, the BlackRock report says, some investors have embraced it as a “flight to safety” over the last five years. This means it is viewed as a safe bet amid times of political and economic instability, similar to gold. “When we think about Bitcoin, we think about primarily as an emerging global monetary alternative,” Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets and one of the report’s authors, said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. As concerns over the U.S. national debt rise, Bitcoin becomes an attractive, alternative reserve asset, detached from the value of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock’s report claims that because of this, Bitcoin can be valuable in helping investors diversify their portfolios. “I think people are taking that idea to heart, and they are investing in Bitcoin to safeguard their money,” said Rodríguez, the Michigan professor. But, he cautions investors against overestimating Bitcoin’s diversification power. “I do think, from a diversification point of view, for example, because they are related fundamentally, because investors are investing both in that and in the stock market, it’s not going to have as good of a diversification effect as the authors’ claim,” Rodríguez added. At the moment, cryptocurrencies and other assets are showing high correlation. A recent Bloomberg study reported that the largest one hundred digital assets and the S&P 500 have been fluctuating together at a level only exceeded once before, in 2022. This could, of course, change based on new developments in the world. “Over the long term, bitcoin’s adoption trajectory is likely to be driven by the degree to which concerns rise and fall over global monetary instability, geopolitical disharmony, U.S. fiscal sustainability and U.S. political stability,” the report said. The new BlackRock report comes at a time when the world’s biggest asset manager has moved into digital assets in a major way following a shift in the regulatory environment. BlackRock became one of around a dozen firms offering Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year, an unprecedented step for both the company and the stock market. An ETF is usually a collection of stocks, bonds or other assets that can be listed as shares on a major exchange. In the case of Bitcoin, ETFs are a way to package cryptocurrencies and offer them on the stock market, making them accessible to a broader group of people. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is known as iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT. Today, IBIT has $22 billion in assets under management and is trading at $36. The ETF reached its highest volume in mid March, almost hitting $4 billion before settling around $1.5 billion. All of this suggests how Bitcoin is becoming an integral part of BlackRock’s business, and why understanding its complex cycles will be important in coming years. In June, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that Bitcoin is “digitizing gold.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: What’s up with… Deutsche Telekom & Meta, SpaceX, AT&T

Sep 26, 2024 In today’s industry news roundup: Giant German telco accuses Meta of “twisting the facts” in the duo’s ongoing peering payments row; SpaceX is courting Vietnam, where it wants its Starlink operation to become a major broadband service provider, with talk of a $1.5bn investment; AT&T has deployed plug-and-play IT stacks to support its MVNO operations; and more! Deutsche Telekom has hit back at Meta’s decision, announced on 25 September, to end its direct peering relationship with the giant German telco, a move that might degrade the quality of service that DT’s mobile customers might experience when using popular applications, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Messenger. Meta accused DT of “putting the open internet at risk and undermining net neutrality principles” and of “using its market power to put its subscribers in Germany behind a de facto paywall, potentially restricting their access to internet services that do not pay Deutsche Telekom” by asking Meta to pay for feeding traffic onto the telco’s networks. Now the telco has responded, saying that Meta is “once again twisting the facts,” and noting that historically Meta has paid a peering fee but stopped its payments during the Coronavirus lockdowns and is failing to renegotiate peering terms. According to DT, by ending its direct connection to the German operator, Meta is “once again abusing its overwhelming bargaining power to discredit legitimate concerns of the European telecommunications industry and consumers in order to avoid fair payment. This is not just about a difference of opinion between two companies,” it added, “but about the question of whether the power of the strongest prevails on the internet or whether there is a fair balance between all participants. We hope that this debate will not be carried out on the backs of the citizens. Even a company like Meta is not above the law.” Let’s hope this ultimately gets settled amicably and that millions of German users don’t end up suffering a degraded service. Deutsche Telekom and Meta aren’t the only ones currently engaged in a war of words. AT&T and Broadcom, which now owns US telco VMware, are locked in a legal battle over the terms of VMware’s licence agreement, as reported earlier this month. AT&T claims that Broadcom, which shifted VMware to a subscription model from its traditional perpetual licence model, is failing to honour a contract agreed with VMware before the chip giant closed its $61bn acquisition of the cloud platform vendor. Now, according to Ars Technica, Broadcom has responded with claims that AT&T has no case as it knew VMware was heading towards a subscription model before it was acquired by Broadcom, adding that the telco is resorting to “sensationalism by accusing Broadcom of using ‘bullying tactics’ and ‘price gouging’. Such attacks are intended to generate press [coverage] and distract the court from a much simpler story.” This dispute will be closely watched by many telcos and other large VMware customers, which have found themselves having to deal with a less economic cost model in recent months. Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to invest $1.5bn in Vietnam, the satellite company’s senior VP for global business and government affairs, Tim Hughes, told Vietnam’s State President Tô Lâm during a meeting in New York this week, state-backed Viet Nam News has reported. “The Vietnamese government is weighing the investment proposal” and is “asking SpaceX to closely coordinate with relevant Vietnamese agencies and partners to complete investment procedures,” the news agency noted. SpaceX’s low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband service provider, Starlink, has been seeking clearance to provide services in Vietnam and it seems clear from the report that the Vietnamese government is open to having Starlink provide data connectivity in rural and remote areas and, in doing so, help the government respond to natural disasters more effectively. Starlink is currently in negotiations about how it can provide its services while meeting Vietnam’s foreign ownership rules: The country recently liberalised its digital infrastructure ownership regulations and that has resulted in growing interest and investments in the country as a hub for datacentres – see Vietnam now a magnet for datacentre developers. AT&T has become the first US operator to achieve ‘Running on ODA’ accreditation from industry body the TM Forum. Running on ODA status is awarded to network operators that have built software stacks that conform with the forum’s open digital architecture (ODA) and open APIs, which enable a more modular, plug-and-play approach to telecom IT operations. AT&T adopted an ODA approach for the back-office operations of its MVNx Ecosystems unit, enabling mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that use AT&T’s mobile network to reach their customers “to offer their own branded mobile services without having to invest in the expensive infrastructure typically required to operate a mobile network. ODA is a critical foundation for delivering this service, providing a common framework on which AT&T’s customers can innovate and offer new experiences by integrating network capabilities into their products and services,” noted the TM Forum in this announcement. “I’m delighted that AT&T has further demonstrated its commitment to ODA and open API standards by gaining Running on ODA accreditation for its MVNx Ecosystems group,” noted Andy Tiller, EVP of member products and services at the TM Forum. “By embracing ODA, AT&T is making it easier and faster for its partners to build and launch new services, leveraging the power of AT&T’s network. This means more innovative offerings and greater choice for consumers,” added Tiller. For more on ODA see DT, Orange et al join the ‘running on ODA’ club. Not for the first time, large language model (LLM) developer OpenAI, best known for its Chat GPT generative AI (GenAI) application, has suffered a top management meltdown. The company nearly imploded late last year when CEO Sam Altman was sacked, appeared to be hired by OpenAI investor Microsoft, and was then reinstated as head honcho of OpenAI. Now, just as the company is in discussions for a fresh round of funding – reportedly $6.5bn at a valuation of $150bn – OpenAI’s influential CTO, Mira Murati, quit suddenly on Wednesday, announcing her departure via a post on X. Murati was not alone – VP of research Barret Zoph and chief research officer Bob McGrew also quit the company which, according to Reuters, might be shifting from ‘not-for-profit’ governance to a ‘for-profit’ model. The trio’s departure marks something of an ongoing brain drain at OpenAI: In August, co-founder John Schulman joined rival AI firm Anthropic, and another co-founder, Greg Brockman, announced he was taking a sabbatical until the end of 2024. Earlier in the year, another co-founder, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, left the company. As you might expect, seasoned industry analyst Richard Windsor is not impressed with recent development at OpenAI: “How this [company] is worth $150bn is beyond me,” he noted in his latest Radio Free Mobile blog. Orange’s decision to delist from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and voluntarily deregister with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced on Wednesday, is simply a matter of reducing the telco’s administrative workload, a spokesperson for the telco told Reuters after the announcement resulted in a dip in the company’s share price on the Paris stock exchange. Orange noted in its official announcement about the decision that the move “is in line with the group’s aim to improve internal simplification and efficiency, while maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and transparent financial reporting. Orange remains fully committed to an open and frequent dialogue with US investors. This decision is expected to have no impact on Orange’s clients and partners or its commercial presence in the US.” Ericsson and optical networking module developer Nubis Communications used this week’s ECOC trade show, held in Frankfurt, to propose the use of co-packaged optics in future radio access network (RAN) architectures. “Co-packaged optics can enable high capacity at low energy consumption in future RAN networks, but dedicated developments are needed,” noted Ericsson in this blog. “In a demo at ECOC 2024, Ericsson and Nubis showcased the ability to operate at high temperatures commonly found within radio units, compatibility with standard optical fibres, and implementation of automated eye-safety mechanisms. This can be very beneficial in the networks of the future, including 6G,” stated the vendor, pointing out that such technology is not currently used in RAN deployments as pluggable optics are currently meeting network operators’ needs. However, data traffic growth will put a strain on pluggables, the partners suggested. To find out more about the case for co-packaged optics in the RAN, check out this blog. – The staff, TelecomTV Sep 27, 2024 Sep 26, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: Berenberg maintains Hold Novo Nordisk shares amid P3 data concerns
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/berenberg-maintains-hold-novo-nordisk-shares-amid-p3-data-concerns-93CH-3634310
Time Published: 2024-09-26T14:22:37Z
Full Content:
Berenberg has maintained its Hold rating on Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) (NYSE: NVO) shares with a price target of DKK975.00. The firm's stance comes in light of investor sentiments around the potential impact of the Phase 3 (P3) trial results for CagriSema, an investigational therapy by Novo Nordisk. Market response to unfavorable trial outcomes is anticipated to have a greater effect on the company's stock value compared to positive trial results. The firm acknowledges the growing uncertainty in the competitive landscape and pricing dynamics within the industry, which were previously addressed in Berenberg's report titled "Embracing the curves of obesity." These factors, combined with the pivotal nature of the CagriSema trial results, are expected to keep a lid on Novo Nordisk's stock performance for the foreseeable future. Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with a focus on diabetes care and other serious chronic conditions. In other recent news, Novo Nordisk has been in the spotlight with its CEO, Lars Jorgensen, testifying on drug pricing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The focus of the hearing was the pricing of the company's weight-loss and diabetes medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk has also been investing heavily in research and development, with $4.2 billion spent in 2023 on diabetes and obesity alone. In parallel, BMO Capital Markets maintained an Outperform rating on Novo Nordisk, despite the mixed results from the phase 2a trial of Monlunabant, a weight loss drug. The trial exhibited a 5.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss at 16 weeks, which surpassed the performance of previous CB1 receptor antagonists at the 52-week mark. Despite the drug's strong efficacy, increasing the dosage beyond 10mg did not yield significant additional benefits. Additionally, a lawsuit against the U.S. law mandating drug price negotiations for Medicare was revived by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. This could potentially impact Novo Nordisk, as its diabetes medication, Ozempic, is under scrutiny for potential inclusion in the 2027 Medicare price negotiations. Despite disappointing results from the Phase II obesity trial of monlunabant, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on Novo Nordisk's shares. The trial showed a weight loss of approximately 6-7% at the 16-week mark, with some mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects noted. Lastly, Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a significant drop following the release of underwhelming trial results for its obesity pill, monlunabant. The trial results showed that monlunabant led to a weight loss of 6.5% after 16 weeks of treatment, which fell short of the anticipated 15% weight loss. As investors weigh Berenberg's hold rating and the potential outcomes of Novo Nordisk's CagriSema trials, it's crucial to consider the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Novo Nordisk boasts a robust market capitalization of $560.71 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the pharmaceuticals industry. The company's gross profit margin stands impressively at 84.53% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating strong profitability in its operations.

Full Content:
In recent years, a relatively novel paradigm known as sustainable development has been introduced in response to concerns regarding the adverse impact of industrial activities on the environment and society. Managers in the food sector have been attempting to incorporate the principle of sustainable development in their supply chains owing to the paramount importance of social and environmental considerations in creating a competitive advantage for food products. To this end, we propose a multi-objective linear mathematical model considering the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. economic, environmental, and social, to design a sustainable food supply chain. Given today’s volatile business environment, we employ a robust optimization model by incorporating Conditional Value-at-Risk into the configuration of two-stage stochastic programming to tackle uncertainty and take up a risk-averse strategy in supply chain design. The model aims to identify the optimal production and delivery times of the products, investigate the effects of their perishability characteristic on inventory decisions, and assess the financial and environmental advantages of transportation decisions to improve the sustainability of logistics operations. A novel version of fuzzy goal programming approach is applied to solve the proposed model. Next, the applicability of the proposed model and its solution method is verified based on computational experiments on a real-world case study of a processed food company. Lastly, conflicts between the sustainability aspects are examined, and several sensitivity analyses on risk-aversion parameters are performed to provide managerial insights for industry executives seeking to optimize their network concerning sustainability issues and well-performance under worst-case scenarios.

A supply chain (SC) is a set of processes and flows that take place within and between different network components, including all parties directly or indirectly involved in fulfilling customers’ demands. The food supply chain (FSC) is perceived as critical infrastructure as it ensures the wellbeing and food security of customers and yields profit for the firms involved [1]. According to projections, the global food demand is expected to rise by 50% by 2030 [2]. The food industry has experienced enormous challenges in recent decades. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, has caused a worldwide spike in food demand over the last four years. Consequently, optimal decisions and efficient SC management are needed to respond to the continuously growing food demand [3]. Researchers and practitioners often classify SC decisions according to the length of the planning horizon into three categories: strategic, tactical, and operational [4]. Supply chain network design (SCND) comprises a set of crucial strategic decisions that determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities as well as the flow between them [5]. Through its influence on tactical and operational decisions, SCND significantly affects product quality, service level, material flow, customer satisfaction, and return on investment [6]. Typically, SCND in the food industry involves a high level of complexity due to the unique characteristics of foodstuff, such as perishability [7, 8]. Unlike many types of commodities, the demand for food is directly affected by the age and freshness of the products. Hence, failure to provide customers with high-quality, fresh food products often leads to a decrease in demand and thereby a dramatic decline in profitability [9]. Therefore, the perishable nature of food products imposes additional costs on the SC and requires continuous monitoring and replenishment of inventory levels in facilities to keep the inventory fresh and consumable [10]. Sustainability is among the significant issues to consider in the network design of FSCs. A SC is considered sustainable when the SC management policies and innovations of the organization are aligned with the principles of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development requires balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social welfare [11]. Sustainable Development Goals are a set of interconnected objectives proposed by the United Nations that call for emphasis on developing sustainable FSCs and effecting fundamental changes to improve the current food systems by 2030 [12]. The World Health Organization reports that FSCs release a significant amount of pollutants which are responsible for an estimated 20 to 30 percent of all environmental impacts [13]. Also, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), over one-third of all food produced annually is wasted. So, food waste is the biggest threat to global food security, and reducing food waste is essential to achieving global food security and sustainable development [14]. On the other hand, risk management in the field of SCND has drawn increasing interest among scholars and industry practitioners [15]. There is a high degree of interdependence between network nodes in any type of SC. Therefore, the risks generated in one node often spread quickly to others and negatively impact their operational and sustainability performance [16]. The occurrence of risks is widely believed to reduce the profitability and efficiency of the SC. In the case of FSCs, risks may also accelerate the products’ deterioration rate, adversely affecting the environment and the firm’s reputation [17]. In this regard, effective risk management is essential to ensure sustainable operations [18]. SC risk refers to potential losses in terms of the objectives resulting from uncertainties in the features of the SC that can arise when a triggering event occurs [19]. In general, two types of risks can be associated with SCND problems: disruption risks and operational risks [20]. Disruption risks, including natural disasters (e.g. floods, earthquakes, and storms), human-made crises (e.g. wars and terrorist attacks), and technological malfunctions (e.g. equipment failure), can significantly undermine the performance of SCs. Operational risks, on the other hand, arise due to uncertainties in parameters such as supply, demand, transportation costs, etc. in dynamic business environments. To be precise, this type of risk is caused by the deviation of stochastic parameters from their expected values, leads to potential financial losses, and hampers the company’s efforts to meet its objectives [21, 22]. The risk-averse approach was developed to cope with uncertain parameters and guide managers when making decisions under uncertain conditions [23]. When addressing FSC problems, it is important to consider the above-mentioned concerns simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is among the first attempts to investigate a comprehensive risk-averse sustainable FSC design problem. In this regard, we model the risk aversion approach using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure to tackle random outcomes, volatility, and the inherent uncertainties of SCs. The proposed multi-period multi-objective programming model considers the perishability of food products based on the production and delivery times of the products and their shelf-life. Also, by addressing three objective functions, the economic, environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development are taken into consideration. We use preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), a novel multi-objective method, to solve the model. Lastly, we test the applicability of the mathematical model through computational experiments conducted on a numerical example and provide a number of managerial insights into some of the model’s critical parameters. The primary contributions, and novelty of this research can be summarized as follows: The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review of the subject. Section 3 describes the problem and its mathematical formulation. Section 4 presents the solution approach of the proposed model. Section 4 is devoted to the real-world case study, computational results and sensitivity analyses on some crucial parameters. Section 5 discuses some managerial insights and practical implications. Eventually, Section 6 provides conclusions and suggestions for future research. In this section, we review the relevant prior research from three different perspectives: (1) food supply chain network design (FSCND) problems, (2) sustainable SCND problems, and (3) risk-averse SCND problems involving risk measures and uncertainty. For the works reviewed in each subsection, we provide a brief summary and then mention the contributions of our study in that regard. Finally, at the end of this section, the details of the relevant prior research and the proposed study are summarized in Table 1 to clarify research gaps. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t001 Due to the growing importance of food, there has been an increasing number of studies on the subject of FSCND in recent years. Mohammed and Wang [24] proposed a multi-objective model to design and plan a meat SC. The researchers used three different methods to solve the multi-objective model and, in the end, opted to use the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to obtain the optimal solution from the Pareto frontier. Mohammed et al. [25] expanded the aforementioned approach by presenting a multi-objective model that used stochastic programming to deal with uncertainty. The authors employed the monitoring system known as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to satisfy the objectives of their model. Mohammed and Wang [26] presented another mathematical model to improve the distribution system of their earlier meat SC model. Aras and Bilge [27] presented a mixed-integer linear programming model to design a FSC in Turkey. The authors utilized the minimax regret approach to deal with uncertain demand. Mohebalizadehgashti et al. [28] formulated a meat SC with the objective of minimizing the total cost and CO2 emission, as well as maximizing the capacity utilization rate of the facilities in the network. Patidar and Agrawal [29] introduced a mixed-integer non-linear programming formulation to optimize the total cost of an agricultural SC. The results indicated that the expenses incurred by farm-to-market transportation were responsible for 85% of the total SC cost. To mitigate this defect, they proposed that the farmers be classified into clusters such that their crops would be aggregated in cluster centers and transported to the market from there. Gholami-Zanjani et al. [30] developed a two-stage scenario-based model with uncertain demand and disruptions caused by an epidemic. The researchers incorporated a number of resilience strategies into the core model to design a resilient FSC. Arabsheybani and Arshadi Khasmeh [31] proposed a robust bi-objective model to design a resilient FSC with the objectives being to maximize the total profit and total resilience score. Relying on four criteria to enhance the resilience of the SC (robustness, agility, leanness, and flexibility). Gholami-Zanjani et al. [13] developed a new framework to configure a resilient green meat SC. The authors implemented two resilience strategies to hedge the network against disruptions and solved the model by applying the sample average approximation and lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff methods. The concept of sustainability has gained popularity in the last few years since it demonstrates that a SC’s competitive advantages cannot only be achieved through optimizing its economic aspects [32]. Sustainability is more emphasized in some industries, such as the food industry, due to the specific characteristics of their products. In this subsection, we survey some of the studies on sustainable SCND problems. Allaoui et al. [2] came up with a hybrid two-stage methodology to optimize a sustainable SC in which sustainable suppliers are selected using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Yakavenka et al. [33] presented a distribution network design problem for perishable food products considering the three dimensions of sustainability. The proposed model’s objectives were to minimize the total cost, total emission of transportation modes, and transportation times. Mohammadi et al. [34] developed a sustainable multi-objective model for a processed food company. The decisions made by proposed model included facility location, aggregating the flow of materials between facilities, and selecting the type of product delivery (either directly from plants or indirectly from distribution centers). Jouzdani and Govindan [35] introduced a non-linear mathematical model to design a sustainable perishable FSC. In this study, the perishability of the products followed the Weibull distribution and was affected by the use of vehicle refrigerator. Goodarzian et al. [36] formulated a bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a citrus fruit supply chain network. The contribution of this paper is the development of a mathematical model for designing a three-echelon network that takes into account coefficient water, CO2 emissions, and time window concurrently. Kalantari and Hosseininezhad [12] developed a sustainable model considering four risk factors: delays, fluctuation of exchange rates, quality of raw materials and production. The authors used the cross-entropy method to solve the model for large instances using the optimization software GAMS. Momenitabar et al. [37] introduced a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network that minimizes total and environmental costs, including energy consumption and pollution emissions, and maximizes employment opportunities. To reduce the environmental impacts, the circular economy concept has been addressed in this study. Momenitabar et al. [38] developed a mathematical model for designing a sustainable bioethanol supply chain network. In order to determine the best method to predict the actual amount of demand, they compared three popular machine-learning methods. In addition, the authors considered two meta-heuristic algorithms to find pareto optimum solutions for the large-scale problem. Goodarzian et al. [39] investigated a novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to establish a sustainable citrus closed-loop supply chain network. The authors included the circularity strategy and the triple bottom lines of sustainability into their model. Mohammadi et al. [40] presented a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a sustainable FSC for perishable products. To show the validity of proposed model, they conducted several sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters and applied the model in a food company. Lastly, Momenitabar et al. [41] integrated machine-learning algorithms with quantitative optimization modeling to design a sustainable bioethanol supply chain. In this work, three machine-learning approaches have been applied to forecast the bioethanol demand as model inputs. A few studies have considered risk-aversion in SCND and their mathematical models, some of which are presented in this subsection. Noyan [42] used two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) to design a disaster management SC under disruption and operational risks. In order to address the variability of non-deterministic parameters, the author incorporated the CVaR measure into the stochastic programming framework. Ahmadi-Javid and Seddighi [43] developed a location-routing optimization model under disruption risks to design a SC consisting of manufacturers and distributors in which a single type of commodity is distributed to several consumers. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model under three risk measurement policies: optimistic, cautious, and pessimistic. The authors utilized the expectation, CVaR, and worst-case risk measures to calculate the risk under each policy. Soleimani and Govindan [44] used a risk-averse TSSP method to plan and design a reverse SC in which the CVaR was used to evaluate the risk associated with the uncertainty in prices and demand for returned products. Govindan and Fattahi [45] proposed a multi-period optimization model under demand uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the total SC cost. The problem was formulated by incorporating TSSP and the CVaR into the model to address risk-aversion. Rahimi and Ghezavati [46] developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to design and plan a sustainable reverse logistics network under uncertainty. The authors applied a risk-averse TSSP approach, utilized the CVaR to cope with the deviation of demand and investment rate from their expected values, and solved a numerical example to obtain potential managerial insights. Rahimi et al. [47] investigated risk-averse SCND by proposing a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to configure a sustainable SC in which the CVaR risk measure was assimilated into the model. This paper contributes mainly by offering various discount policies for selling products to customers. Lotfi et al. [48] developed a model to design an antifragile, sustainable, and agile network that integrates these concepts taking into account several factors such as resilience, risk, robustness, and environmental issues. The authors incorporated the Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) measure into the stochastic programming framework to address risk-aversion. The cost function of this model encompasses the expected value, maximum, and EVaR. Lotfi et al. [49] proposed a novel hybrid method of robust optimization which employs a stochastic approach to address uncertainty and risk management. The objective function of the model given involves maximizing the coefficients of mean and minimum profits under multiple scenarios, while considering an energy-aware constraint. Lotfi et al. [50] introduced a novel viable SC in which robust stochastic optimization is combined with CVaR as risk criteria to ensure an optimal approach. The objective function of their model minimizes the expected value, maximum, and CVaR of cost. Lotfi et al. [51] presented a new data-driven robust optimization in viable supply chain network design by utilizing Open Innovation (OI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT). The authors employed a robust stochastic optimization technique and assimilated the CVaR measure into the model to effectively tackle uncertainty as well as risks. As our review of the literature reveals, several studies have investigated sustainable FSCND, but no comprehensive study has been conducted on risk-averse SCND while developing a sustainable FSC at the same time. To address this gap, we present a sustainable risk-averse FSC by incorporating the CVaR into our model to develop a robust network in an uncertain environment. Moreover, a few papers have considered the specific characteristics of food products, such as perishability, in their proposed FSCs (e.g. [13, 30, 34]). Therefore, we also incorporate perishability and its implications into our model by considering the shelf-life of foodstuff to prevent the decay of finished products along the SC. We discovered that making inventory and transportation decisions based on integration of production and delivery times may bridge a significant gap in the literature on FSCND. Furthermore, in the majority of the research papers on sustainability, the only instance of social impact addressed by the authors appeared to be job creation, and other factors such as safety had been largely neglected. Our research methodology outlining the steps undertaken is summarized by the flowchart presented as Fig 1, acting as a guide for the research process. In light of the gap analysis presented in this subsection, and based on Table 1, the present study may contribute to the literature in the following ways: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g001 In this study, we develop a risk-averse sustainable FSC considering the perishability of the food products. The proposed SC is multi-echelon, multi-period, and multi-product, and consists of raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers (DCs), and retailers with uncertain demand. The process of material flow begins by purchasing raw materials from the suppliers. Next, the products are manufactured in the factories and shipped to the retailers through the DCs by transportation modes. Fig 2 graphically illustrates the structure of the proposed FSC. To design the aforementioned network, a two-stage multi-objective programming model is presented. In this model, the three dimensions of sustainability are introduced in the form of three objective functions. In the first objective, the economic dimension of sustainability is addressed by minimizing the total costs of the network composed of the first stage costs, second stage costs, and CVaR costs. The environmental dimension of sustainability is the second objective function which minimizes the total environmental effects of the network. Total environmental effects of the SCN are comprised of carbon released by establishing facilities, production, handling processes and transportation. Lastly, social dimension of sustainability is considered in the third objective which represents the social aspect of the SC and aims at maximizing the total social effects of the network, which includes of created job opportunities and worker’s lost days multiplied to their given weight.

In this type of framework, decisions are made over two sequential stages. In the first stage, decision-makers should make scenario-independent decisions that typically determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities. Scenario-independent decisions are made before the realization of uncertain parameters (e.g. demand, supply, transportation costs, etc.) and generate the first-stage (a.k.a. design stage) costs. In the second stage, scenario-dependent decisions (e.g. material flow, inventory level, production rate, etc.) are made regarding the second stage (a.k.a. planning stage) costs after the values of uncertain parameters have been realized [52]. Eq (1) gives the first objective function, i.e. economic sustainability, which aims to minimize total cost of the SC, consisting of first-stage, second-stage, and CVaR costs. The components of Eq (1) are formulated as follows: (2) (3) (4) Eq (2) obtains the fixed costs of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eq (3) calculates the second-stage costs, consisting of the costs of purchasing raw materials, production, distribution, inventory holding in manufacturers and DCs, transportation, and lost demand in retailers, with respect to the set of scenarios. The last component of Eq (1) relates to the costs of the CVaR, which is defined as Eq (4) [22]. Eq (5) states the second objective which represents environmental sustainability and minimizes the total environmental impacts of the proposed SC, comprising the carbon emitted in the processes of establishing the facilities, production, handling, and transportation of the products. The terms of Eq (5) are presented as follows: (6) (7) (8) (9) Eq (6) computes the amount of carbon emitted in the process of establishing the manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (7) and (8) compute the environmental impacts of production and handling processes in the manufacturers and DCs, respectively. Eq (9) determines the amount of carbon emitted from the transportation of products. The first term of Eq (9) states the environmental impacts of transporting raw materials from suppliers to manufacturers, while the second term represents the environmental impacts of transporting the finished products from manufacturers to DCs. The last term of Eq (9) calculates the environmental impacts of transporting the products from DCs to retailers. Eq (10) concerns social sustainability and aims to maximize the total social impacts of the proposed SC which consists of the number of job opportunities created and workers’ lost days multiplied by their weight. The components of Eq (10) are defined as follows: (11) (12) The first component of Eq (10) states the number of jobs created by establishing manufacturers and DCs, presented as Eq (11). The second component, calculated by Eq (12), pertains to the number of lost days caused by work-related damages during the process of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (13) and (14) ensure that each manufacturer and DC can be established only at one capacity level. Eq (15) indicates the amount of raw material purchased from suppliers. Due to the fact that food products are inherently perishable, inventory management and transportation decisions between network nodes require applying more constraints compared to other products. Therefore, in this paper, by considering the shelf life, production and delivery times of products individually, we intend to prevent the perishability of products along the network. In fact, the level of products inventory and the amount of products flow between network nodes are associated with the optimal production and delivery times as well as shelf life of the products. To address this issue, Eqs (16) to (29) have been defined in the proposed model. Eqs (16) to (18) calculate the inventory level of products according to their shelf-life for each manufacturer at different periods. Eqs (16) and (17) show the level of on-hand inventory at time periods shorter than the shelf-life of the product. However it is worth mentioning that in the first period, no inventory is added from the previous period. Therefore, the inventory levels of the products in each manufacturer for t = 1 < slp and 1 < t < slp are calculated separately using Eqs (16) and (17), respectively. Eq (18) computes the inventory level at time periods longer than the shelf-life of the product. Eqs (19) and (20) compute the flow of each product from a manufacturer to a DC considering its production period. As mentioned in Eqs (16) to (18), the product flows between the relevant nodes are formulated differently for t < slp and t ≥ slp. Eqs (21) and (22) present the inventory balance of products in each manufacturer based on their production period. Similar to Eqs (16) to (18), the inventory levels of products in the DCs for different intervals of t are calculated by Eqs (23) to (25). Eqs (26) and (27) define the flow of each product from a DC to a retailer based on its production time. Eqs (28) and (29) determine the inventory levels of DCs based on their delivery periods. Eq (28) indicates when the delivery period is equal to the time period, the inventory level of DCs is equal to the quantity of products delivered from manufacturers to DCs subtracted by the flow of products to retailers. Eq (29) states that when t − e < slp, the current inventory level is equal to the inventory level of the previous period subtracted by the flow of products to the retailers. Eq (30) determines the quantity of products shipped to retailers as well as the quantity of shortage. Eq (31) defines the raw material procurement capacity of suppliers. Eq (32) presents the production capacity of each manufacturer at each time period. Eqs (34) and (35) express the maximum throughput capacity of each manufacturer and DC, respectively. Eqs (35) to (37) show the capacity constraint of the transportation modes. Eqs (38) to (40) state the decision variables whose values should be zero. Eq (41) calculates the deviational value that exceeds the value-at-risk. Finally, Eqs (42) and (43) express the types of the decision variables. In the process of solving real-world problems, there is often more than one objective function, each offering a specific solution if optimized separately. Such circumstances require that a trade-off be established among the objective functions and multi-objective optimization approaches were originally conceived precisely to solve such problems. One of the most commonly-used optimization approaches, introduced by Charnes et al. [53], is known as goal programming. In this approach, decision-makers define an expectation level for each objective function as its goal and try to minimize the deviation from these expectation levels [54]. Ostensibly, decision-makers should accurately determine the expectation level of each objective; however, in reality, the uncertainty of the available information makes it nearly impossible to assign perfectly accurate levels to the objectives. Fuzzy sets theory, introduced by Zadeh [55], is regarded as an effective approach to decision-making under uncertainty. Arikan and Güngör [56] then combined fuzzy set theory and goal programming to create the fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach. Recently, a novel extension of FGP, known as preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), was proposed by. The model was developed with different priorities and had the advantage of largely eliminating the limitations of the original approach. One such limitation was that decision-makers were required to set a precise lower bound for the satisfaction degree of the objectives. Moreover, it was often the case that in order to achieve the minimum satisfaction degree for one of the objectives, a better total satisfaction degree for all objectives had to be eliminated. The new model identified and mitigated this issue, accepting solutions that have a higher satisfaction degree while taking into account the priority of the objectives in question. In this approach, the goals are prioritized and the satisfaction degree of the first priority should be greater than the others. By adding certain equations to constraints that illustrate the importance of each goal, this priority structure is taken into account. PFGP is applicable to multi-objective problems that involve uncertainty and objectives with different importance degrees [57]. In the present study, we adopt the PFGP method as it eliminates the requirement that a fixed value be determined for both the objective function and the satisfaction degree. It also takes uncertainty into account when determining the goal of each objective. Using this method, decision-makers can easily adjust the priority of the objective functions and observe the results of the optimal solution [58]. The notations of PFGP are as follows (Table 3): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t003 Using the notations presented above, the mathematical model based on PFGP can be expressed as follows: (44) s.t. Eq (44) expresses the goal of the PFGP approach which is maximizing the total satisfaction degree. In Eq (45), hc(X) represents the constraints of the main model. Eqs (46) and (47) determine the satisfaction degrees of the goals for minimization objectives, where ∀i = (1, 2,…, ii) is the set of minimization objectives. Eqs (48) and (49) calculate the satisfaction degrees of the goals for maximization objectives, where ∀i = (ii + 1,…, i) is the set of maximization objectives. Eq (50) relates to the priority of the goals, stating that the most important objective should achieve a satisfaction degree greater than or equal to the other objectives. Finally, Eq (51) defines the type of the decision variables of the PFGP model. In this section, we introduce the case study used in this research and the input data of its parameters. The problem is then solved using PFGP, and the analysis results are presented at the end. Due to the constantly evolving lifestyles of consumers, the processed food industry plays a significant role in providing the population’s needs by producing and distributing a variety of products, also appearing to be on a growing trajectory. In this study, we investigate a processed food company as a real-life case study to measure the effectiveness of our model. The manufacturing plant is located in Tehran province, Iran, and the products are sold on domestic and international markets. The manufacturer procures its required raw materials, mainly chicken and beef, from multiple suppliers. In the proposed model, we consider only two types of finished products: hamburger 80% beef, and sausage 70% chicken. Because of their perishability, the products are transported by refrigerated trucks. The network size of the case study detailed in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t004 In this study, we focus on three three modes of transportation: light truck, medium truck, and heavy truck. The data used in the present research on the capacities of transportation modes and the quantities of CO2 emissions have been retrieved from Mohammed et al. [25] and Nayeri et al. [59] (see Table 5). Three levels of capacity: low, medium, and high, with different costs, carbon emissions, and job opportunities have been considered for establishing facilities in potential locations. Tables 6 and 7 show the values of the parameters related to each manufacturer and DC with different capacity levels. Also, we examine three prominent demand scenarios for each retailer in our case study: the most pessimistic, the most probable, and the most optimistic. Numerous studies in the literature on SCND problems have repeatedly implemented the same three demand levels to generate their scenarios and have subsequently attested to the reliability and efficiency of the method (e.g. [22, 60, 61]). According to the historical data obtained from the case study as well as the experts interviewed for the purposes of this paper, the occurrence probability of scenarios are estimated at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. Tables 8 to 11 detail the costs of the model, including the fixed cost of establishing facilities, operational cost, raw material purchasing cost, and holding cost of finished products. Since the finished products discussed in this study have different raw material consumption rates, weights, shelf-lives, and production processes, the production capacity and costs associated with each type of product vary, as well (see Table 12). In addition, Table 13 provides the data on the corresponding values of each retailer’s demand under each scenario. The environmental parameters are presented in Tables 14 to 16. We have gathered the data on environmental parameters from several sources, including the food carbon footprint calculator, an online platform provided by MyEmissions.green, and also from academic articles (e.g. [62]). The values of the social parameters can be found in Tables 17 and 18. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t008 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t010 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t012 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t014 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t015 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t016 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t017 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t018 The proposed mathematical model is solved by the optimization software GAMS using the case study parameters. Furthermore, λ1 > λ2 > λ3 is the fuzzy satisfaction degree reflecting the importance degrees of the objective functions according to the experts’ opinions. Table 19 details the output generated from solving the model. In addition, the numerical results of some analyses performed on the model are presented in the following subsections. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t019 The majority of stochastic programming models addressing food supply chain (FSC) under uncertainty are usually designed to be risk-neutral. In this paper, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming is aiming to trade off the expected total cost and risk cost, based on a predetermined level of responsive risk aversion employing CvaR as a coherent risk measure. The purpose of this subsection is to compare the main risk-averse problem (considering CvaR) and risk-neutral problem (without considering CvaR). The comparison of the economic objective function of the proposed model between risk-averse and risk-neutral problems is illustrated in Fig 3. As can be seen, the value of economic objective function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Since it overcomes the variability of the uncertain parameters, provides more robust solutions compared to a risk-neutral problem in presence of uncertainty, and assist decision makers when faced decisions with uncertain outcomes. It is worth noting that decision-makers can achieve higher levels of risk aversion by increasing the value of network costs, which will cause the model to behave more conservatively and generate better solutions in worst-case scenarios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g003 In this subsection, we intend to examine the service level of the SC in terms of lost demands. In the long run, unmet demands can result in customer dissatisfaction which, in turn, could negatively affect the firm’s reputation. Consequently, we can conclude that the more the level of service provided by the SC, the less lost demand will occur. In simple terms, lost demand is a consequence of increasing the total cost with the purpose of establishing balance between economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Table 20 details our analysis of the total value and percentage of lost demands for finished products under each scenario. The finished products in each scenario have varying amounts of unfulfilled demands in which the abovementioned reason is mainly responsible for them. Another noteworthy point inferred from the table is that when the demand for the finished products rises by 50% in the in probable scenario, the quantities of lost demand for the two products increase by 32.1% and 35.7%, respectively. It may thus be concluded that insufficient production capacity is the most likely culprit for the resulting unmet demand. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t020 This section is dedicated to sensitivity analyses on the sustainability dimensions. For this purpose, we solve the proposed model in three different types: economic, green, and sustainable, and then proceed to discuss the results. In the economic type, only the economic objective function is addressed in the model; in the green type, both the economic and environmental objective functions are addressed simultaneously; and in the sustainable type, the problem is solved by considering the economic, environmental, and social objective functions, i.e. all three dimensions of sustainability. According to Table 21 and Fig 4, solving the problem in the economic type leads to the economic and environmental objective functions to take their best and worst values, respectively. However, focusing solely the economic dimension obtains the best value for the economic objective function. In the green type, by adding an environmental dimension to the problem, the opposite of the results of the economic type is obtained. That is, the economic and environmental objective functions take their worst and best values within the specified cases, respectively. Based on this observation, we may conclude that the green type increases the value of the economic objective in order to ensure a better value for the environmental objective. In the sustainable type, in order to establish a balance between the three dimensions of sustainability, economic and environmental objectives both gain values that lie between the values they were assigned in the economic and environmental types. Moreover, Table 19 indicates that the sustainable type results in a 9% increase in the total cost, as well as a 28.3% decrease in the environmental impacts, and a 53.6% increase in the social impacts compared to the economic type. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t021 In the PFGP approach, the influential factor is the priority of objective functions, which is defined by their fuzzy satisfaction degrees (λi). Therefore, we solve the model in six cases to assess the impact of changes in the objective functions’ priority on the problem. Table 20 shows the results of solving the model in the presented cases. Based on Table 20 and Fig 5, the conflicts between the economic and environmental goals are evident. In case 1, when the economic objective function takes the highest priority, it is assigned the best value, while the environmental objective function is assigned the worst. In Case 2, in which the priority of the second objective function is higher than the other two, the environmental impact is given the best value, with the economic objective function getting the worst. In case 3, where both the environmental and economic objectives are equally important, the value of both objective functions is squarely between their worst and best values. Table 22 and Fig 6 illustrate the conflict between the economic and social objective functions. In case 4, when the economic objective has the highest priority, it is assigned the best possible value. Conversely, the social objective function receives the worst value among all the cases. Based on case 5, when the social objective function becomes the top priority, it gets the best value, while the economic objective function has the worst value. Finally, in Case 6, in which the social and economic objectives share the top priority, the value of both objective functions is between their lowest and highest. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t022 In this section, we assess the risk-aversion parameter in order to clarify how it may affect the objective functions of the proposed model and the obtained solutions. Consider an experiment with four different β values where the value of θ = 0.5 remains fixed to better comprehend how β impacts the model. Table 23 and Fig 7 show that as β grows larger, the value of the economic objective function increases, as well. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t023 Since CVaR measures the mean value of the worst (1 − β) % of the total expected cost, when the value of β increases, the risk aversion behavior of the proposed model improves. Hence, the model behaves more conservatively and the CVaR concentrates on the greater realization of total cost. Total costs are comprised of the first-stage costs, CVaR costs, and second-stage costs. It is also important to note that, the first- stage costs and consequently the number of established facilities do not change in response to varying risk parameters since they are not a function of CVaR. In other words, CVaR costs affect the second-stage costs. In general, we may draw the conclusion that a high risk-aversion strategy would result in higher levels of the second-stage costs and the total costs. To better comprehend this mechanism, we need to examine how β influences the environmental and social objective functions. As previously mentioned, by raising the value of β and giving the model a risk-averse attitude, the value of the economic objective function increases and the model should become more conservative, resulting in an upward trend in the value of the environmental impact and a downward trend in social impacts. This conflict can be clearly observed in Table 23 and Fig 8. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g008 To examine the impact of changes in demand on the value of the objective functions, we solve the model in five demand modes: -30%, -15%, 0%, +15%, and +30%). The results of the sensitivity analyses are shown in Fig 9. As expected, rising demand values increase the total SC costs. This may be a consequence of establishing new high-capacity facilities, increased raw material procurement and production of finished products, as well as transportation between the network nodes to satisfy the demand. Furthermore, as more high-capacity facilities are activated and transportation between facilities is raised, which leads to the use of higher capacity transportation modes, the adverse environmental impacts of the network increase. In addition, as the demand grows, the model tends to create more jobs by establishing more facilities and activating higher capacity levels to meet the retailers’ demand. In case of a significant increase in demand, the proposed model tries to keep the total SC costs at a minimum by not establishing new facilities. This is because the costs of opening new facilities to fully meet the demand outweigh the costs incurred by lost demands. Therefore, the model prefers to avoid establishing new facilities, activates lower capacity levels, and only partially satisfies the demand. This results in a less steep upward trend in total cost and social impact. As Fig 9 indicates, the reaction of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions in the proposed model to changes in demand under different modes complies with the above-mentioned explanations, indicating the proper logic of the model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g009 Taking into account the current situation of the case study, which consists of one medium-capacity manufacturer and two high-capacity DCs, the values of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1999168 × 107, 79453400, and 529.2, respectively. In accordance with the opinions of the case study experts, the potential locations for construction of new facilities were selected based on the company’s revision plans regarding its supply chain to gain a larger market share. The results of solving the proposed model for the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1952306 × 107, 75179800, and 491.4, respectively. Fig 10 compares the proposed and current conditions of the case study and displays the values of the model’s objective functions. As can be observed, compared to the current situation, the model proposed in this research causes a 2.3% drop in costs, a 5.4% drop in adverse environmental impacts, and a 7.1% drop in social impacts. This is achieved by constructing a medium-capacity manufacturers along with one medium-capacity and two low-capacity DCs. Thus, it can be said that the proposed model, whose candidate locations for the company’s future plans were selected by the experts, improves the current situation in terms of costs and environmental impacts. In addition, considering the high priority of the total SC costs, the downward trend of the social objective function in favor of the economic objective function seems logical. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g010 In this study, we developed a sustainable risk-averse model to design a SC for processed food products under uncertain conditions. To this end, a multi-period multi-objective model was presented to make decisions on facility location, optimal sourcing, transportation mode selection, capacity planning, and inventory management. The resulting model addresses three dimensions of sustainability as economic, environmental, and social objective functions, thereby minimizing the total cost and carbon emissions and maximizing the number of job opportunities created and safety of the FSC. The main contribution of this research to the literature may lie in our decision to incorporate a risk measure into the design of a sustainable FSC; an innovation that has never been attempted by previous researchers. Furthermore, we applied a scenario-based TSSP approach to cope with the uncertainty of demand for finished products and utilized a novel PFGP multi-objective method to solve the mathematical model. Also, we compared our proposed model with a situation in which the CvaR risk measure was not taken into account. Finally, results show that the value of cost function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Because it behaves more conservatively and offers more resilient solutions in the presence of uncertainty compared to a risk-neutral problem. Practitioners and academics can achieve significant outcomes by solving real-world case studies aligned with distinctive industry characteristics. Selecting the processed food industry in Iran and optimizing FSC, which contributes to all dimensions of sustainability, can be beneficial for food industry executives. Several useful managerial insights can be drawn from the analysis of the numerical results, including the following: This research advances the field of FSC by addressing perishability in inventory decisions based on the production and delivery times of the products. A scenario-based TSSP approach that incorporates CvaR as a risk criteria into the objective function is employed to ensure a robust network in an uncertain environment. Finally, investigating a real case study in processed food industry, several strategic decisions including facility location, supplier selection, capacity planning, and transportation mode selection are made in the proposed FSCN. Based on sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters, findings of our research are as follows: The limitations of the research are obtaining optimal solutions on a large scale and within an acceptable timeframe. To address this issue, we recommend applying exact and evolutionary algorithms in combination with novel heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, such as those put forward by [63–65]. Finally, the authors would like to recommend the following as potentially promising subjects for further investigation. It is possible to experiment with different quality levels for raw materials and suppliers can place various purchase discounts based on the quality and quantity of the raw materials required by manufacturers. Additionally, exploring global SC issues and factors may be a highly relevant research route, as most leading SCs in various sectors operate globally today. Furthermore, incorporating other risk criteria, such as Entropic VaR (EVaR) and Robust CvaR (RCVaR) may provide significant benefits for conservative decision-makers as future research, aiming to enhance the robustness of the model’s performance and enable it to effectively handle fluctuations [66]. Utilizing alternative methods, like stochastic, fuzzy, and robust optimization techniques that incorporate data-driven uncertain parameters can offer risk-averse decision-makers a more accurate representation of the situation, enabling them to make optimum decisions while reducing risks [64, 66, 67].

We recently compiled a list of the 10 best performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stands against the other Top-Performing Warren Buffett Stock of 2024. Warren Buffett has etched his name as the most successful investor on Wall Street by steering a small company into a trillion-dollar empire. The milestone stems from the billionaire investor’s value investing strategy that has always focused on undervalued stocks with tremendous upside potential. In a year where the overall market has been on an upward trajectory thanks to solid financial results amid a resilient economy and expectations of interest rate cuts, Buffett has outperformed the overall market. His investment firm gaining more than 28% compared to a 17% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period underscores Buffett’s competitive edge in picking and investing in market-beating stocks.

Buffett, who rose to prominence in the 1960s, has transformed his investment firm into a conglomerate with stakes in companies in the insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing, and energy sectors. According to Andrew Kligerman, TD Cowen’s Berkshire analyst, Buffett’s performance in 2024 is a testament to his stock-picking skills focused on businesses trading at relatively lower valuations. Nevertheless, the billionaire investor has been in defensive mode despite the stellar performance for the better part of 2024. Concerned by valuations getting out of hand amid the high interest rate environment and deteriorating economic conditions, Buffett has dumped massive amounts of stocks in companies whose valuations got out of hand. With the massive sale of stakes, the billionaire has successfully generated significant value as most of the stocks had gained significantly amid the bull run in the market. The stock sale has also allowed the billionaire investor to raise the cash pile in his investment firm to a record $277 billion. Source: pexels Although Buffett has previously argued against diversification, it’s understandable why his firm decided to reduce stakes in some of the companies. The investments had been a huge success for his firm, locking profits with the overall market at all-time highs. The fact that Buffett invests through a conglomerate structure, often considered archaic, underscores his edge in the highly competitive investment world. At 94, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ has started showing signs of slowing down. The appointment of Greg Abel as his successor signals he may not have a significant say in investment decisions in the near future. What might come as a surprise is that the best-performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024 are not among the big names that account for the biggest share of Buffett’s portfolio. Instead, they are companies that have remained resilient amid the high interest rate environment that has rattled the stock market. Additionally, they boast of stocks well positioned to benefit as the macroeconomic environment improves, with the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points. The US economy is avoiding recession as the Fed continues to tweak its monetary policy, which should allow the companies to generate more shareholder value and, therefore, continue powering high. Buffett’s investment portfolio also includes companies with tremendous potential and ability to generate free cash flow owing to resilient core businesses. Consequently, the companies have emerged as a source of passive income, allowing Buffett to generate billions of dollars in dividends. Last year alone, the Oracle of Omaha raked $4.36 billion in dividends from his investments. Our Methodology We analyzed Berkshire Hathaway’s Q2 2024 portfolio and picked the best-performing stocks on a year-to-date basis, as of September 20. The list is sorted in ascending order of the year-to-date performance of the stocks. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Warren Buffett’s Q2 2024 Stake: $10.38 Billion Year to Date Gain as of September 20: 28.36% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 59 Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best-performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024 in the financial service sector. It specializes in providing a range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in financial markets. It is one of the oldest holdings in Buffett’s portfolio and continues to generate significant value in share price gains and dividend offerings. Its competitive edge stems from operating two robust businesses. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) runs a business that evaluates the creditworthiness of different bond issuers, including companies and governments. It holds a significant market position, facing competition primarily from S&P Global and Fitch Ratings. Additionally, it has an analytics division that employs data to assess risk. Record-low interest rates have encouraged companies and government bodies to issue debt for over a decade. This has sustained the importance of Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s core operating division. Booming businesses have seen the stock sentiments receive significant powering to record highs. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has moved to strengthen its business empire and reach the market. The firm revealed its purchase of Praedicat, a company that focuses on analytics for the casualty insurance industry. This deal is anticipated to improve Moody’s data and analytical capabilities, especially in the areas of casualty and liability risk assessment, but it is not expected to affect Moody’s financial performance for the year 2024 significantly. The company delivered solid second-quarter results, with revenues increasing 22% to $1.8 billion. On the other hand, earnings came in at $600 million or $3.02 a share, up from $2.05 a share last year. Growth in the underlying core business and solid financial results is the catalyst behind the stock rallying by 28.36% and outperforming the 18% gain of the S&P 500. In Q2 2024, 59 out of the 912 hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey purchased shares of the firm. The largest hedge fund investor in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which holds shares valued at $10.38 billion. Overall MCO ranks 10th on our list of 10 best performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Wall Street is looking at a higher open Thursday, led by surging tech stocks after memory chipmaker Micron delivered a better-than-expected quarter and upside guide. Micron shares jumped 18%. China stocks rallied again — this time on signs the Chinese government is prepared to add fiscal stimulus to this week's central bank monetary stimulus. The commentary out of China supported global markets. 2. Micron said high bandwidth memory sold out for calendar year 2024 and 2025. Personal computers set to have a better second half of 2025 as artificial intelligence PCs gain momentum. Micron's smartphone unit growth expected to continue in 2025. Jim Cramer said on X: "If you bought Micron off of our suggestion from our [Mad Money] Gameplan last Friday I would not sell it. That was some forecast for every business in 2025. It also affirms AMD and NVDA outlooks." Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are Club stocks. 3. Starbucks was upgraded to an outperform buy rating at Bernstein. Even after the stock's 27% move since Brian Niccol was named CEO, the analysts think the valuation of the Club stock "does not fully appreciate the earnings power that Starbucks could unlock." Starbucks also was getting a bump on the fiscal stimulus commitment from the Chinese government. 4. GE Healthcare was downgraded to sell at UBS on concerns about rising competition from Chinese competitors. The analysts' pessimism seems overblown. The company has a strong relationship in China and has been manufacturing there for 30 years. Health-care stimulus packages in China have been slow to roll out, and that's weighed on the Club-owned maker of MRI machines. Here's our screen on China exposure for all of our 32 portfolio stocks. 5. Bank of America raised its Meta Platforms to $630 per share from $563, representing 10% upside to Wednesday's close. JPMorgan took its PT on Meta to $640. The fresh bullish commentary followed the wearable showcase at the company's Connect 2024 product and developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought out prototype AR glasses that received rave reviews, including a stamp of approval from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 6. Southwest Airlines upped its third quarter forecast and announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and other changes at its investor day on Thursday. The carrier is making the moves as it battles activist investor group Elliott Management. 7. Truist started First Solar and power play GE Vernova with buy ratings. For the Club, our solar and renewable play is Nextracker, whose technology makes sure solar panels are always facing the sun. We also own Eaton as a way to benefit from the growing complexity of energy infrastructure in the age of AI. 8. Jefferies Financial dropped on a quarterly profit and revenue miss. The results provided an early look into investment banking and capital markets activity before the big banks, including Club names Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, report in a couple of weeks. Jefferies said IB was strong and capital markets were only down a bit compared to tough comps. 9. JPMorgan raised its DraftKings price target to $54 per share from $48 and kept its overweight buy rating. The analysts said positive comments at online betting and iGaming platform Flutter Entertainment's Capital Markets Day is good news for DraftKings. Flutter is FanDuel's parent company. 10. Hershey was downgraded to an underperform sell by Jefferies research analysts on chocolate snacking concerns. The analysts said that "everyday chocolate is being bought less frequently, especially by low-income consumers," because prices are so high. — Sign up for Jim Cramer's Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Wall Street is looking at a higher open Thursday, led by surging tech stocks after memory chipmaker Micron delivered a better-than-expected quarter and upside guide. Micron shares jumped 18%. China stocks rallied again — this time on signs the Chinese government is prepared to add fiscal stimulus to this week's central bank monetary stimulus. The commentary out of China supported global markets. 2. Micron said high bandwidth memory sold out for calendar year 2024 and 2025. Personal computers set to have a better second half of 2025 as artificial intelligence PCs gain momentum. Micron's smartphone unit growth expected to continue in 2025. Jim Cramer said on X: "If you bought Micron off of our suggestion from our [Mad Money] Gameplan last Friday I would not sell it. That was some forecast for every business in 2025. It also affirms AMD and NVDA outlooks." Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are Club stocks. 3. Starbucks was upgraded to an outperform buy rating at Bernstein. Even after the stock's 27% move since Brian Niccol was named CEO, the analysts think the valuation of the Club stock "does not fully appreciate the earnings power that Starbucks could unlock." Starbucks also was getting a bump on the fiscal stimulus commitment from the Chinese government. 4. GE Healthcare was downgraded to sell at UBS on concerns about rising competition from Chinese competitors. The analysts' pessimism seems overblown. The company has a strong relationship in China and has been manufacturing there for 30 years. Health-care stimulus packages in China have been slow to roll out, and that's weighed on the Club-owned maker of MRI machines. Here's our screen on China exposure for all of our 32 portfolio stocks. 5. Bank of America raised its Meta Platforms to $630 per share from $563, representing 10% upside to Wednesday's close. JPMorgan took its PT on Meta to $640. The fresh bullish commentary followed the wearable showcase at the company's Connect 2024 product and developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought out prototype AR glasses that received rave reviews, including a stamp of approval from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 6. Southwest Airlines upped its third quarter forecast and announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and other changes at its investor day on Thursday. The carrier is making the moves as it battles activist investor group Elliott Management. 7. Truist started First Solar and power play GE Vernova with buy ratings. For the Club, our solar and renewable play is Nextracker, whose technology makes sure solar panels are always facing the sun. We also own Eaton as a way to benefit from the growing complexity of energy infrastructure in the age of AI. 8. Jefferies Financial dropped on a quarterly profit and revenue miss. The results provided an early look into investment banking and capital markets activity before the big banks, including Club names Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, report in a couple of weeks. Jefferies said IB was strong and capital markets were only down a bit compared to tough comps. 9. JPMorgan raised its DraftKings price target to $54 per share from $48 and kept its overweight buy rating. The analysts said positive comments at online betting and iGaming platform Flutter Entertainment's Capital Markets Day is good news for DraftKings. Flutter is FanDuel's parent company. 10. Hershey was downgraded to an underperform sell by Jefferies research analysts on chocolate snacking concerns. The analysts said that "everyday chocolate is being bought less frequently, especially by low-income consumers," because prices are so high. — Sign up for Jim Cramer's Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

From a financial health perspective, Rocket Lab holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, an InvestingPro Tip that indicates the company's solid liquidity position to support its ambitious projects and potential expansions. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, further underscoring its financial resilience. InvestingPro users can discover more about Rocket Lab's financials and future prospects with additional tips available on the platform. Currently, there are 15 more InvestingPro Tips listed for Rocket Lab, offering deeper insights for those interested in the company's investment potential.

Title: Why Financial Institutions Need to Engage in ESG
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/26834/why-financial-institutions-need-to-engage-in-esg
Time Published: 2024-09-26T12:43:15Z
Full Content:
As the world becomes increasingly aware of the climate crisis, social inequalities, and corporate governance issues, consumers are demanding more responsibility from businesses, including banks and financial institutions. This shift didn't happen overnight, but the evolution of consumer attitudes towards environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, accelerated by global challenges like COVID-19, is forcing industries to reimagine their impact on the world. Evolving consumer expectations Consumers have always prioritized convenience, service quality, and product offerings when selecting a bank or financial institution. However, a growing awareness of social and environmental issues has transformed this rationale. Consumers today are looking beyond products and interest rates; they are scrutinizing how financial institutions align with their personal values around sustainability, social justice, and ethical governance. The data shows that 40% of US households would sacrifice some return to invest in companies that reflect their values. The rise of social media, instant access to information, and global movements like Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, etc. have amplified this shift. Younger generations, particularly those under 40, are leading the charge, placing pressure on businesses to not only serve their financial needs but also contribute meaningfully to societal challenges. For these consumers, it is no longer enough for a bank to avoid harmful practices – banks must now actively engage in sustainable and responsible initiatives to earn their trust. The data shows that 42% of US households would only do business with financial institutions that they believe are committed to improving social issues. The banking sector's response to ESG Recognizing this shift, many financial institutions in the US have started embracing ESG principles, although the degree of commitment varies. Large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, have begun implementing sustainability goals, with some pledging to achieve net-zero carbon emissions within their lending portfolios by 2050. These moves signal that ESG has become a core consideration, not just a marketing tool. Banks are investing in renewable energy projects, issuing green bonds, and offering products like ESG-focused investment funds to cater to this evolving consumer base. The investment sector's response to ESG Investment firms are also adapting by offering their clients portfolios that prioritize ESG-conscious companies. BlackRock, for example, has publicly committed to making sustainability a core component of its investment strategy. This is not just about meeting regulatory requirements but also about attracting a consumer base that is increasingly selective about where their money is invested. However, while some financial institutions have made strides in embracing ESG principles, others have been slower to act. For many, the process of integrating these considerations into their business model requires a significant cultural and operational shift, which can take time to realize. The impact of COVID-19 on ESG initiatives The COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the momentum for many businesses looking to invest in and roll out ESG initiatives. With the economy in crisis mode, many companies diverted resources toward more immediate concerns, such as maintaining liquidity, preserving jobs, and meeting short-term financial obligations. This resulted in delays in launching or expanding ESG-related programs. In the banking and finance sectors, the focus shifted to stabilizing operations and responding to customer needs during unprecedented financial uncertainty. Banks had to prioritize lending and support for small businesses and vulnerable communities affected by the pandemic, while ESG initiatives often took a backseat. The pandemic also reinforced the importance of ESG. It exposed systemic vulnerabilities, from economic inequalities to the need for stronger corporate governance, prompting a reevaluation of long-term strategies. As the immediate crisis subsides, businesses are finding that ESG commitments are more important than ever in building resilience for future challenges. Like businesses, consumers’ attentions were also redirected and focused on immediate needs such as healthcare, employment, and financial stability. The emphasis on ESG temporarily decreased, as consumers' attention was drawn toward personal survival rather than the ethical and sustainable practices of corporations. This shift in focus highlights the fragility of ESG priorities during times of crisis but also sets the stage for a renewed and stronger commitment post-pandemic. ESG across industries The banking sector is not the only industry where ESG has become a significant driver of consumer decision-making. Across sectors such as retail, technology, and automotive, ESG has become a vital part of brand identity and product development. For example, electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla have positioned themselves as leaders in sustainability, making environmental responsibility central to their value proposition. In retail, companies like Patagonia and Nike have embraced sustainability and ethical labor practices, responding to consumers who are willing to pay more for eco-friendly and socially responsible products. The trend is clear: consumers are increasingly expecting companies to align with their values, and this mindset carries over when choosing financial products or providers. How financial institutions can better support ESG and social initiatives For banks and financial institutions, the path forward is clear: engaging deeply with ESG principles is no longer optional. Those that fail to prioritize these areas risk losing relevance, particularly among younger, values-driven consumers. So how can financial institutions better support ESG, local communities, and social initiatives? 1. Product innovation: Develop products and services that support ESG goals, such as green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and ESG-focused mutual funds. By aligning their offerings with consumer values, banks can attract customers who are committed to social and environmental change. 2. Community investment: Support local communities through targeted investments in small businesses, affordable housing, and renewable energy projects. This not only builds goodwill but also strengthens long-term customer relationships. 3. Transparency and accountability: Consumers demand authenticity. Financial institutions should provide clear and transparent reporting on their ESG commitments, offering measurable goals and progress updates. Establishing trust is key to maintaining consumer loyalty. 4. Employee engagement: Foster a culture of social responsibility within the organization by encouraging employees to participate in ESG-related initiatives, from volunteer programs to corporate sustainability efforts. Employees who feel connected to these values are more likely to be engaged and contribute to the company's long-term success. Why financial institutions need to engage in ESG The financial sector wields significant influence over the broader economy and has the ability to drive meaningful change. By embracing ESG principles, banks and financial institutions not only meet consumer expectations but also contribute to solving some of the most pressing global challenges, from climate change to social inequality. As consumers continue to hold businesses to higher standards, the financial sector must recognize that its role is evolving. ESG is no longer a "nice to have" – it has become imperative to long-term success. Financial institutions that embrace this reality will not only meet the demands of today’s consumers but also help shape a more sustainable, equitable future.

September 26, 2024 08:30 ET | Source: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC September 26, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (“Biodexa” or the “Company”) Interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (Nasdaq: BDRX), an acquisition-focused clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs, today announces its unaudited interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 which will also be made available on the Company’s website at www.biodexapharma.com OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The Company announced the following in the six months ended June 30, 2024: Post period end: FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Post period end: Commenting, Stephen Stamp, CEO and CFO, said “It was a busy first half for Biodexa. Licensing in eRapa, a Phase 3 ready asset with access to $17 million of non-dilutive grant funding, is an enormous step forward. The second half will be about executing on our lead programs. We already have approval from Health Canada for the IIT Phase 2a study of tolimidone in Type 1 diabetes and we are working diligently to set up a global Phase 3 registrational study of eRapa in FAP so we can begin recruiting early next year.” For more information, please contact: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Stephen Stamp, CEO, CFO Tel: +44 (0)29 2048 0180 www.biodexapharma.com About Biodexa Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (listed on NASDAQ: BDRX) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs. The Company’s lead development programs include eRapa, under development for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and Non-Muscle Invasive Blader Cancer; tolimidone, under development for the treatment of type 1 diabetes; and MTX110, which is being studied in aggressive rare/orphan brain cancer indications. eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis. Tolimidone is an orally delivered, potent and selective activator of Lyn kinase. Lyn is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, which is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, in neural tissues, liver, and adipose tissue. Tolimidone demonstrates glycemic control via insulin sensitization in animal models of diabetes and has the potential to become a first in class blood glucose modulating agent. MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. Biodexa is supported by three proprietary drug delivery technologies focused on improving the bio-delivery and bio-distribution of medicines. Biodexa’s headquarters and R&D facility is in Cardiff, UK. For more information visit www.biodexapharma.com.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Our primary focus in the first half of 2024 was on assimilating tolimidone, licensed in December 2023, into our portfolio and searching for additional clinical-stage assets to diversify and advance our pipeline which ultimately led to the licensing of eRapa in May 2024. eRapa License In line with our strategy to build a sustainable therapeutics company in rare/orphan diseases, we continue to search for opportunities to broaden and diversify our development pipeline. On April 25, 2024, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (“LCA”) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa, an oral formulation of rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) for use in all diseases, states or conditions in humans. Under the LCA, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture, commercialize, or otherwise exploit products containing rapamycin. Pursuant to the terms of the LCA, the Company and Emtora established a joint development committee to monitor and progress the development of eRapa. Emtora has conducted a Phase 1 study of eRapa in prostate cancer, a Phase 2 study in FAP and has an ongoing Phase 2 study in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer. Preparations are under way for a registrational Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. In consideration for the license, we made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, we are also responsible for up to an aggregate $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, we are also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora’s legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favour of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven. We also made an additional $0.5 million payment which was used for a match to an advance from the CPRIT. Emtora had secured a grant of $17.0 million from CPRIT to support the Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. The grant requires a 1 for 2 match and Biodexa was expected to fund the match of up to $7.5 million, being 50% of the remaining CPRIT grant, which was completed in September 2024. Grant funding is available once the match payment has been certified and CPRIT has approved eligible trial expenses. In certain instances, CPRIT may advance payments before eligible trial expenses have been incurred. Upon a change of control of the Company, we will issue Emtora a warrant exercisable for 1,604,328 ADSs. The LCA also provides us with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). R&D update Following the in-licensing of eRapa, our development pipeline has not only advanced in terms of clinical stage but expanded to six programmes overall, four of which are orphan indications: eRapa eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis1. Rapamycin is approved in the US for organ rejection in renal transplantation as Rapamune®(Pfizer). Through the use of nanotechnology and pH sensitive polymers, eRapa is designed to address the poor bioavailability, variable pharmacokinetics and toxicity generally associated with the currently available forms of rapamycin. eRapa is protected by a number of issued patents which extend through 2035, with other pending applications potentially providing further protection beyond 2035. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (“FAP”) FAP is an orphan indication characterized by a proliferation of polyps in the colon and/or rectum, usually occurring in mid-teens. There is no approved therapeutic option for treating FAP patients, for whom active surveillance and surgical resection of the colon and/or rectum remain the standard of care. If untreated, FAP typically leads to cancer of the colon and/or rectum. There is a significant hereditary component to FAP with a reported incidence of one in 5,000 to 10,000 in the US1 and one in 11,300 to 37,600 in Europe2. eRapa has received Orphan Designation in the US with plans to seek such designation in Europe. Importantly, mTOR has been shown to be over-expressed in FAP polyps – thereby underscoring the rationale for using a potent and safe mTOR inhibitor like eRapa to treat FAP. An open-label Phase 2 study (NCT04230499) was conducted by Emtora in seven U.S. centres of excellence in 30 adult patients. Patients were sequentially enrolled into three dosing cohorts of 10 patients each for a 12-month treatment period: 0.5mg every other day (Cohort 1), 0.5mg daily every other week (Cohort 2), and 0.5mg daily (Cohort 3). Upper and lower endoscopic surveillance occurred at baseline and after six months. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of eRapa and percentage change from baseline in polyp burden, as measured by the aggregate of all polyp diameters. In May 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at six months were presented at the prestigious 2024 Digestive Disease Week annual meeting in Washington D.C. by Carol Burke, MD, the Principal Investigator. In summary, at six months, eRapa appeared safe and well-tolerated with a significant 24% reduction in the total polyp burden at six months compared with baseline (p=0.04) and an overall 83% non-progression rate. In June 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at 12 months were presented at the bi-annual InSIGHT meeting in Barcelona by Dr Burke. Overall, 21 of 28 (75%) patients were deemed to be non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 17%. In Cohort 2, the likely dosage regimen for Phase 3, eight of nine (89)% of patients were deemed non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 29%. Over the course of 12 months, there were four related Grade 3 or higher and one related Serious Adverse Event reported during the trial and 95% compliance rate at 12 months. One patient was removed from the trial due to non-compliance. The Phase 3 registrational study is planned to be a double-blind placebo-controlled design recruiting approximately 150 high risk patients diagnosed with germline or phenotypic FAP. The primary clinical endpoint is expected to be the first progression free survival event which will comprise composite endpoints including major surgery. A ‘Type C’ meeting with the FDA is planned for 4Q24 to finalise the protocol and related matters. A $17 million grant from CPRIT will support this study. Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (“NMIBC”) NMIBC refers to tumors found in the tissue that lines the inner surface of the bladder. The most common treatment is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (“BCG”) with chemotherapy depending upon assessment of risk of recurrence. NMIBC is the fourth most common cancer in men with an incidence of 10.1 per 100,000 and 2.5 per 100,000 in women3. Our ongoing multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in NMIBC is expected to enrol up to 166 patients with primary endpoints of safety/tolerability and relapse free survival after 12 months of treatment. The Phase 2 study, which is supported by a $3.0 million non-dilutive grant from the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, is expected to read out in mid-2025. MTD228 – Tolimidone Tolimidone was originally discovered by Pfizer and was developed through Phase 2 for the treatment of gastric ulcers. Pfizer undertook a broad pre-clinical program to characterize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and toxicology of tolimidone. Pfizer discontinued development of the drug due to lack of efficacy for that indication in a Phase II clinical trial. Tolimidone is a selective activator of the enzyme Lyn kinase which increases phosphorylation of insulin substrate-1, thereby amplifying the signalling cascade initiated by the binding of insulin to its receptor. Type 1 Diabetes (“T1D”) Tolimidone’s potential utility in T1D has been demonstrated by several ground-breaking preclinical studies conducted by the University of Alberta, where Lyn kinase was identified as a key factor for beta cell survival and proliferation in in vitro and in vivo models. Most importantly, tolimidone was able to induce proliferation in beta cells isolated from human cadavers. From a mechanism of action perspective, tolimidone has been shown to both prevent beta cell degradation and to stimulate beta cell proliferation. In a meta analysis of 1,202 articles and 193 studies, the incidence of T1D was shown to be 15 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 9.5 per 10,000 of the population4. As a first step in the continued clinical development of tolimidone, a Phase 2a Investigator Initiated Trial (IIT) at the University of Alberta Diabetes Institute is designed to establish the minimum effective dose of tolimidone in patients with T1D. The study, which was approved by Health Canada in July 2024 is expected to recruit 12 patients initially across three dose groups. The study will measure C-peptide levels (a marker for insulin) and HbA1c (a marker for blood glucose) after three months compared with baseline and the number of hyperglycemic events. MTX110 MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the brain tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. All three types of brain cancer being studied are orphan. Recurrent Glioblastoma (“rGBM”) Our Phase 1 MAGIC-G1 study (NCT05324501) of MTX110 in rGBM completed the dose escalation part of the study with the recruitment of the fourth patient in Cohort A. In February 2024 we announced Patient #1, who had received sub-optimal infusions of 60µM of MTX110 had survived for12 months from the start of treatment (OS=12). GBM universally recurs and once it does median overall survival according to a retrospective analysis of 299 patients reported in the Journal of Neuro-Oncology is 6.5 months. Post period end, we provided an update on the status of cohort A in the MAGIC-G1 study: patients #1 and #2 have deceased with overall survival (OS) since start of treatment of 12 months and 13 months, respectively. Patients #3 and #4 remain alive with progression free survival (PFS) since the start of treatment of 6 and 9 months, respectively and OS thus far of 12 and 11 months respectively. GBM virtually always recurs with median Progression Free Survival of 1.5–6.0 months and median Overall Survival of 2.0–9.0 months5. Diffuse Midline Glioma (“DMG”) In February 2024 we announced headline data from a Phase 1 IIT study conducted by Columbia University in newly diagnosed patients with DMG. As this was the first ever study of repeated infusions to the pons via an implanted CED catheter, the primary objective of the study was safety and tolerability and, accordingly, the number of infusions was limited to two, each of 48 hours, 7 days apart in nine patients. One patient suffered a severe adverse event assessed by the investigators as not related to the study drug. Although not powered to reliably demonstrate efficacy, median overall survival (OS) of patients in the study was 16.5 months compared with median survival rate in a cohort of 316 cases of 10.0 months (Jansen et al, 2015. Neuro-Oncology 17(1):160-166). Study investigators subsequently presented the results of the trial at the 21st International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (ISPNO 2024) in Philadelphia. Medulloblastoma An IIT Phase I study of MTX110 in medulloblastoma remains ongoing at the University of Texas. Financing As a pre-revenue biotech company, securing adequate finance to fund operations to an out-licensing and/or partnering event is a constant focus. On the back of the eRapa in-licensing and the subsequent announcement of positive 6-month and 12-month data of eRapa in FAP, we accomplished two financings; the first in May 2024 and the second post period end in July 2024. May 2024 Warrant Exercises On May 22, 2024, we raised $6.05 million of gross proceeds from the exercise of previously issued warrants following an agreement between the Company and several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the Series E and/or Series F warrants for cash, we issued one replacement warrant for each Series E warrant exercised in the form of a Series G warrant, and one replacement warrant for each Series F warrant exercised in the form of a Series H warrant. The Series G and Series H warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $2.50 each. July 2024 Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement On July 22, 2024, we utilised our capacity under our Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, we issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 ADSs, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 ADSs. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. 1. https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/familial-adenomatous-polyposis/ 2. https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/733#:~:text=FAP%20has%20a%20birth%20incidence,colorectal%20cancer%20(CRC)%20cases. 3. Cassell et al., World J Oncol. 2019 Jun; 10(3): 123–131. 4. National Library of Medicine, Mobasseri et al., published online 2020 Mar 30. doi: 10.34172/hpp.2020.18 5. Birzu et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794906 1H24 FINANCIAL REVIEW The unaudited results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are discussed below: Key performance indicators (KPIs): Biodexa’s KPIs focus on the key areas of operating results, R&D spend and cash management. These measures provide information on the core R&D operations. Additional financial and non-financial KPIs may be adopted in due course. Revenues Total revenue for the six months to June 30, 2024 was £Nil compared to £0.30 million in the first six months of 2023. The R&D collaboration with Janssen, which represented the entire revenue in 1H23, concluded in September 2023. Research and Development R&D costs in 1H24 reduced by £0.06 million, or 3%, to £2.19 million compared with £2.25 million in 1H23. The percentage of R&D costs as a percentage of total operating costs increased to 52% in the period from 50%. The reduction in R&D costs in 1H24 reflects a reduction in spend of £0.54 million on the MAGIC-G1 study in rGBM, the termination of legacy drug delivery projects and lower personnel costs offset by the addition of MTD228 (tolimidone) and MTX230 (eRapa) for a combined expenditure of £0.65 million in 1H24. Administrative Costs Administrative costs in 1H24 decreased by £0.26 million, or 11% to £2.03 million from £2.29 million in 1H23. The decrease in administrative costs in 1H24 is a result of a positive reversal in foreign exchange of £0.23 million and a reduction in professional fees of £0.14 million offset by increases in share-based payment charge of £0.12 million and sundry other costs. Finance Income and Expense Finance income in 1H24 and 1H23 included gains in respect of an equity settled derivative financial liability of £0.75 million (1H23: £0.39 million). The gains arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. In addition, the Company earned interest on cash deposits. Finance expense in the period related to lease liabilities and discounted interest on deferred consideration. Cash Flows Cash outflows from operating activities in 1H24 were £4.81 million compared to £3.88 million in 1H23, driven by a net loss of £3.31 million (1H23: £3.57 million) and after negative working capital of £0.87 million (1H23: positive £0.21 million) and other negative non-cash items totalling £0.63 million (1H23: negative £0.52 million). Net cash used in investing activities in 1H24 of £0.75 million in 1H24 resulted from the purchase of eRapa licence for total consideration of £3.07 million including cash consideration of £0.85 million (1H23: £Nil) offset by £0.10 million of interest received (1H23: £0.02 million). Net cash generated in financing activities in 1H24 was £4.65 million (1H23: inflow £6.25 million), which was driven by receipts from share issuances, including warrants, net of costs of £4.74 million offset by payments on lease liabilities of £0.09 million. Overall, cash decreased by £0.92 million in 1H24 compared to an increase of £2.39 million in 1H23. This resulted in a cash balance at June 30, 2024 of £5.06 million compared with £5.23 million at June 30, 2023 and £5.97 million at December 31, 2023. Going concern Biodexa has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio. For the six months to June 30, 2024, the Group incurred a consolidated loss from operations of £3.31 million (1H23: £3.57 million) and negative cash flows from operating activities of £4.81 million (1H23: £3.88 million). As of June 30, 2024, the Group had accumulated deficit of £147.88 million. The Group’s future viability is dependent on its ability to raise cash from financing activities to finance its development plans until commercialisation, generate cash from operating activities and to successfully obtain regulatory approval to allow marketing of its development products. The Group’s failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. The Group's consolidated interim financial information has been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2024, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £5.06 million. The Directors forecast that the Group currently has enough cash to fund its planned operations into the first quarter of 2025. If the Company does not secure additional funding before the first quarter of 2025, it will no longer be a going concern and would likely be placed in Administration. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and considered the cash flow requirement for the Group for the next three years including the period 12 months from the date of approval of this interim financial information. These forecasts show that further financing will be required before the first quarter of 2025 assuming, inter alia, that certain development programs and other operating activities continue as currently planned. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares (including the ADSs) and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. On August 27, 2024, the Company received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC advising that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid requirement set forth in NASDAQ’s rules for continued listing of its securities. The Company has requested a Hearing Panel which has paused any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. If the Company's ADSs are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company's ADSs or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company's ADSs could suffer a material decline. Delisting may impair the Company's ability to raise capital. In the Directors’ opinion, the environment for financing of small and micro-cap biotech companies continues to be challenging. While this may present acquisition and/or merger opportunities with other companies with limited or no access to financing, as noted above, any attendant financings by Biodexa are likely to be dilutive. The Directors continue to evaluate financing options, including those connected to acquisitions and/or mergers, potentially available to the Group. Any alternatives considered are contingent upon the agreement of counterparties and accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of alternative courses of action to finance the Group would be successful. This requirement for additional financing in the short term represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Should it become evident in the future that there are no realistic financing options available to the Group which are actionable before its cash resources run out then the Group will no longer be a going concern. In such circumstances, we would no longer be able to prepare financial statements under paragraph 25 of IAS 1. Instead, the financial statements would be prepared on a liquidation basis and assets would be stated at net realizable value and all liabilities would be accelerated to current liabilities. The Directors believe there are adequate options and time available to secure additional financing for the Group and after considering the uncertainties, the Directors consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of clinical trials. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we lack sufficient capital to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Going Concern – material uncertainty Biodexa has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio.

The LCA entered into with Emtora meets the definition of a Joint Arrangement under IFRS 11, specifically related to the FAP program. A jointly controlled escrow account was established on completion of the LCA. All FAP program transactions are processed through the escrow account, including the Company’s deposits of matching funds, as set out in the agreement, the receipt of grant funding from CPRIT and the payment of eligible R&D expenses. Although the CPRIT grant and R&D supplier contracts are with Emtora, the joint arrangement nature of the LCA results in Emtora being deemed to be acting as the Company’s agent. Accordingly, the Company recognises 100% of the grant and 100% of the R&D expenditure. The CPRIT grant recognised is on a 1 for 2 match. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, the grant, as it is the re-imbursement of directly related costs, is credited to R&D costs in the same period in The Statements of Comprehensive Income. The escrow account is recognised within prepayments, CPRIT grant received in advance is recognised within deferred revenue and any grant not yet received is recognised in accrued income. In 1H24 the company recognised R&D costs of £0.2 million on the FAP project, this was made up of expenditure of £0.5 million netted against CPRIT grant of £0.3 million. The balances as at June 30, 2024 were as follows in relation to the FAP project: Prepayments £1.2 million Deferred revenue £0.1 million The gain on the equity settled derivative financial liability in 1H24 and 1H23 arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. Income tax is recognised or provided at amounts expected to be recovered or to be paid using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Group Statement of Financial Position date. Research and development tax credits are recognised on an accruals basis and are included as an income tax credit under current assets. The research and development tax credit recognised is based on management’s estimate of the expected tax claim for the period and is recorded within taxation under the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Scheme. Basic loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net loss for the period from continuing operations, attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. As the Group made a loss for the period the diluted loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share. The Company has considered the guidance set out in IAS 33 in calculating the denominator in connection with the issuance of Pre-Funded, Abeyance Shares, Series A, Series B and Series C warrants as disclosed in note 8. Management have recognised the warrants from the date of grant rather than the date of issue of the corresponding Ordinary Shares when calculating the denominator. The Group has made a loss in the current and previous periods presented, and therefore the options and warrants are anti-dilutive. As a result, diluted earnings per share is presented on the same basis as basic earnings per share. The individual intangible assets which are material to the financial statements are as follows: *asset is not yet in use and has not started amortising On April 25, 2024 the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (LCA) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa. In consideration for the License, the Company made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favor of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven and certain historical liabilities relating to their on-going FAP and NMIBC programs were settled. The Company is also obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. In addition, the Company is also responsible for up to $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets, with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, the Company is also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora’s legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. The LCA also provides the Company with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). If the Company does not exercise the option, it would be required to make additional quarterly payments, as disclosed in note 7, until the first commercial sale of the product. The Company is obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. This financial liability is measured on Level 3, the fair value is derived using a discounted cash flow approach. The discount rate applied to the obligation was 11.64% (2023: n/a). A 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the liability by approximately £0.03 million (2023: n/a) and £0.03 million (2023: n/a), respectively. An increase in the liability would result in a loss in the revaluation of financial instruments, while a decrease would result in a gain. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. Equity settled derivative financial liability is a liability that is not to be settled for cash. No warrants recognised as equity settled derivatives were exercised in 2023. The Company issues warrants exercisable into ADSs of the Company as part of registered direct offerings and private placements in the US. The number of ADSs to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise price is denominated in US Dollars being different to the functional currency of the Company. Therefore, the warrants are classified as equity settled derivative financial liabilities recognised at fair value through the profit and loss account (‘FVTPL’). The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes model. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘finance income’ or ‘finance expense’ lines item in the income statement. A key input in the valuation of the instrument is the Company share price. Details of the warrants are as follows: May 2024 warrants In May 2024 the Company issued 2,359,012 Series G ADS Warrants and 3,695,218 Series H ADS Warrants as part of the Warrant Inducement Transaction. The exercise price per ADS is $2.50. December 2023 warrants In December 2023 the Company issued 3,000,063 Series E ADS Warrants and 3,000,063 Series F ADS Warrants as part of the Registered Offering in the US. The exercise price per ADS is $2.20. May 2023 warrants In June 2023 the Company issued 276,689 Series D ADS Warrants as part of a registered direct offering and private placement in the US after securing shareholder approval. The exercise price per ADS was $16.00. May 2020 warrants In May 2020 the Company issued 838 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. October 2019 warrants In October 2019 the Company issued 392 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. Warrant re-price On May 22, 2024 the Company entered into agreements with several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants, issued in December 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. Warrants and Dara share options The Group also assumed fully vested warrants and share options on the acquisition of DARA Biosciences, Inc. (which took place in 2015). The number of ordinary shares to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise prices are denominated in US Dollars. The warrants are classified equity settled derivative financial liabilities and accounted for in the same way as those detailed above. The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The exercise price of the outstanding options is $1,903.40. The following table details the outstanding warrants and options over ADSs and ordinary shares recognised as equity settled derivative financial liabilities as at June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and also the movement in the year: Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. The fair value of the Group’s derivative financial liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The following table gives information about how the fair value of this financial liability is determined. Changing the unobservable risk-free rate input to the valuation model by 10% higher while all other variables were held constant, would not impact the carrying amount of shares (2023: nil). There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. The financial liability measured at fair value on Level 3 fair value measurement represents consideration relating to warrants issued in May 2024, December 2023, June 2023, May 2020 and October 2019 as part of Private Placements, Registered Direct offerings and the Warrant Inducement Transaction. During the period the Company issued the following warrants over ADSs, and these were recognised in the warrant reserve until exercise: The Series A, Series B and Series C warrants are exercisable on an ‘alternative cashless basis’ effectively allowing the holders to exercise for nil consideration. Ordinary and deferred shares were recorded as equity. The Directors consider there to be no related party transactions during the periods reported other than Directors Remuneration. The Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Bioasis on December 13, 2022 as amended on December 18, 2022. Under the agreement the Company agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of Bioasis for consideration of, in aggregate, approximately C$7.4 million (c£4.4 million). The agreement was subject to shareholder approval. On January 23, 2023 at the General Meeting to approve the Arrangement Agreement none of the special resolutions were passed and, accordingly, the acquisition of Bioasis did not proceed. Under the agreement the Company agreed to reimburse Bioasis US$225,000 for expenses relating to the transaction should the Company’s shareholders not approve the transaction. On March 3, 2023 the Company advised Bioasis that it would offset this liability against the $500,000 loan it advanced to them during December 2022 and January 2023. As at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had a contingent liability of $225,000 in relation to this potential liability. On July 22, 2024, the Company utilised its capacity under its Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, the Company issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 Depositary Shares, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 Depositary Shares. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. On August 27,2024, the Company , received a Staff Determination letter (the “Letter”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company of the Staff’s determination to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market because the Company’s securities have had a closing bid price below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, which triggers a notice of delisting pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Rule. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), the Company is not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. Accordingly, and as described in the Letter, unless the Company timely requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), the Company’s securities would be subject to suspension/delisting. Accordingly, the Company requested a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. On September 19, 2024, the Company announced a ratio change on its ADSs from one (1) ADS representing four hundred (400) ordinary shares, to the new ratio of one (1) ADS representing ten thousand (10,000) ordinary shares (the "Ratio Change"). The effective date of the Ratio Change is expected to be October 4,2024. vv Attachment

Partnership with BlackRock and Securitize brings new UStb stablecoin to Ethena Labs' product lineup. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethena Labs has announced the introduction of UStb, a new stablecoin fully backed by BlackRock’s on-chain BUIDL fund, developed in partnership with Securitize. This product is an additional fiat stablecoin alongside USDe, offering a differentiated risk profile to users and exchange partners. UStb will reportedly function identically to traditional stablecoins and exist as an isolated product distinct from USDe. BlackRock and Securitize’s collateralization aims to provide stability and trust in the asset’s backing, appealing to users seeking alternatives within the stablecoin market. One concern regarding USDe has been its response to negative funding rate environments. Despite six months of bearish conditions, Ethena’s sUSDe has not yet experienced a negative funding rate. However, the protocol has mechanisms to adjust its backing composition dynamically between basis positions and liquid stable products in varying interest rate environments. USDe will now reportedly benefit from incorporating UStb during weak funding conditions. If governance deems it necessary, Ethena can close hedging positions and reallocate backing assets to UStb to mitigate risks associated with negative funding rates. This flexibility enhances the protocol’s resilience and adaptability in fluctuating market conditions. As Ethena expands into centralized exchange collateral offerings beyond its current integrations with Bybit and Bitget, it plans to offer exchange partners the choice between two distinct products for margin collateral. The introduction of UStb provides additional options for exchanges and users, potentially broadening the adoption of Ethena’s stablecoin solutions. Further updates on UStb’s timelines and new exchange integrations are expected to be shared soon. The forthcoming details will outline how UStb will be integrated into additional platforms, enhancing its accessibility and utility within the crypto ecosystem. Ethena Labs claims a desire to continue to innovate in DeFi, aiming to transform Ethereum into a crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin that operates independently of the traditional banking system. The company’s approach involves leveraging delta-neutral strategies, on-chain custody, and derivatives to manage volatility and improve scalability and stability. Ethena’s USDe is a synthetic dollar fully backed and transparently recorded on-chain, allowing seamless integration throughout the DeFi ecosystem. It surpassed $3b in market cap in June but has since retraced slightly to $2.5 billion. The introduction of UStb plans to complement USDe by providing an alternative stablecoin option that is particularly useful in varying market conditions. Following the announcement of UStb, Ethena Labs’ ENA governance token experienced a notable surge over the past 24 hours. The token’s price increased by approximately 14%, climbing from a low of $0.307 to a high of $0.378. Trading volume also saw a significant uptick, reaching around $196.1 million.

Title: AT&T, T-Mobile Embrace ‘Open Access’ Fiber After Years Of Opposition
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2024/09/26/att-t-mobile-embrace-open-access-fiber-after-years-of-opposition/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T12:26:00Z
Full Content:
Broadband Two years ago, Techdirt’s Copia Institute released a report discussing how open access fiber networks were a potential path toward boosting fiber competition in the United States. Such networks, sometimes community owned, involve collaboratively building a centralized fiber infrastructure that multiple competitors can come in and compete over. In instances where this has been successfully achieved — like Utah’s Utopia or in Ammon, Idaho — users sometimes have the option of dozens of different fiber ISPs, which in some cases can be switched between with just a few clicks on a web portal. The projects lower the cost of market entry. The competition drives down prices, improves service quality, and generally results in better broadband access. Understandably big ISPs like Comcast and AT&T didn’t much like that, and spent years fighting such projects knowing they threatened their regional dominance. But now some executives at AT&T and T-Mobile appear to have seen the light, with both companies striking new deals to build or participate in such open access networks: “Once staunch opponents of open access, Tier 1 Internet Service Providers are now entering a space that, in the United States, has been pioneered by local governments two decades ago. In the last year-and-a-half, AT&T has embraced open access through its Gigapower joint venture with BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with $10 trillion assets under management.” In this case BlackRock is building the network, and AT&T would be the “anchor tenant” (the first ISP to sign up for service). The about face for AT&T is fairly significant; the company went from fighting such network vehemently, to their CEO making the rounds talking up the benefits of open access. The approach always made sense financially and developmentally; AT&T and larger ISPs simply opposed it because they didn’t want anything disrupting their regional telecom monopolies or duopolies, which allow them to price gouge captive customers trapped in markets without competition. AT&T’s opposition was particularly venomous when community-owned networks (municipals, cooperatives) were involved. What changed these companies minds? They’re lining up to potentially obtain more than $45 billion in broadband subsidies currently looming thanks to 2021 infrastructure bill legislation. That money isn’t expected to start flowing in earnest until next year. The bullishness is great to see, but it will be interesting to see if it remains intact once AT&T (a company with a long history of making promises it doesn’t deliver on) has nabbed their desired cut of taxpayer funds. Filed Under: BEAD, broadband, competition, fiber, high speed internet, infrastructure bill, open access, telecom Companies: at&t, blackrock, t-mobile Yeah, I have my extreme doubts. Who wants to bet that they’ll half-ass the deployment of these networks too? Or that they’ll deploy them and then pull out of the deal once they’ve gotten a big chunk of that 45b? Don’t think you’ll find many people arguing against you on that one. The usual trick is to give unfair preference to the “anchor tenant”. You can buy service from a third-party provider, but, you know, sometimes someone “accidentally” disconnects a fibre, and tickets from the third-party providers don’t get handled quickly. Maybe those providers have unreasonable tariffs, such that they can’t realistically offer unlimited service but the anchors can. Or the third-party wholesale rate is more than the advertised first-party retail rate, which is the current situation with Bell fibre in Canada. Such shenanigans are why the U.K.’s regulator eventually demanded full “functional separation” between B.T. and OpenReach. If we really knew what we were doing, we would have fibre to every home, and allow anyone to run over it. There is no need to have EXCLUSIVE USE of any fiber optic cable to the home. The cool thing about fiber is you can MULTIPLE services over the same fibre, just by using a different wavelength of light. So you could have one fibre, carrying internet from multiple providers, tv from multiple providers, phone from multiple providers etc.. It is 100% possible and doable if there was a little effort. The cool thing about fiber is you can MULTIPLE services over the same fibre, just by using a different wavelength of light. 10G-PON uses different wavelengths from GPON, which means a 10G subscriber won’t be slowed down by GPON subscribers on their node. RFoG also uses a different wavelength. But I’m not sure an ISP can just arbitrarily choose the wavelengths for each service, such that one could subscribe to multiple 10G ISPs, for example. I’m also not sure it particularly matters. Multi-fibre cables are cheap enough to run to each subscriber, much as houses and apartments were usually provisioned with 2 telephone pairs per dwelling. In both cases, most people will never need it. (Why would they? If they have fast unlimited internet service, they can use that to connect to whatever other services they’ll need. If they want redundancy, they probably don’t want to use fibres with common routing.) They’ve announced back in 2022: Gigapower plans to deploy a fiber network to 1.5 million customers located outside of AT&T’s existing 21-state wireline presence using a commercial open access platform. This will contribute to AT&T’s previously announced goal of deploying fiber to more than 30 million locations by the end of 2025. Since they haven’t announced something big since then, this may look like they try to prospect for find some new markets but still waiting for a bunch of federal investments to start connecting anything. Clearly, it’s not the BlackRock’s $10T assets that will be used to building fiber infrastructure. I’m an American but live in Italy. Many things do not run very smoothly here, but internet tends to be quite good. Each neighborhood here has a carrier that installs the fiber and runs it. They can be your provider or you might select another. We pay under 20 usd or month for 800mbps down. It has been very reliable. I’ve seen this structure multiple times. First up, the ISP contributes its expertise in proscribing the network components and the investment company contributes the money to roll out the network. Once the network has been built out, the ISP buys the network from the investment company so they only have one month/quarter with bad results and the investment company has more money than they put up. Oh, and the `open’ claim is long forgotten by that point. What changed these companies minds? They’re lining up to potentially obtain more than $45 billion in broadband subsidies currently looming thanks to 2021 infrastructure bill legislation. That money isn’t expected to start flowing in earnest until next year. The bullishness is great to see, but it will be interesting to see if it remains intact once AT&T (a company with a long history of making promises it doesn’t deliver on) has nabbed their desired cut of taxpayer funds. Hold on a minute. Shouldn’t that money be going to Blackrock? Why does AT&T get a big slice if they’re just the service provider and not the implementor/hardware provider?

Title: Nvidia is back in the $3 trillion club — and Jensen Huang is $2 billion richer
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-huang-stock-market-cap-3-trillion-club-1851658116
Time Published: 2024-09-26T12:25:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang is $2.3 billion richer thanks to a recent bump in Nvidia stock. Shares of the chip giant were up more than 2% in pre-market trading, after closing up about 2% at $123.51 apiece Wednesday. The uptick in the company’s stock brought its market capitalization back above $3 trillion, recovering ground from recent losses and bringing Nvidia back into the coveted club. Huang’s net worth now stands at $108 billion, making him the 13th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. The CEO has a roughly 3% stake in Nvidia, which makes up the majority of his net worth. This current uptick in Nvidia stock may be driven by Bain’s annual technology report, released Wednesday, that predicted that the market for AI products could reach as much as almost $1 trillion by 2027. The consulting firm predicted that companies will need to make “unprecedented levels of investment in technology infrastructure” to remain on top — a positive signal to investors that mass funding of data centers and other critical AI infrastructure will remain strong. “If large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,” the report said. Nvidia is one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, and has become a bellwether for excitement and demand for artificial intelligence. The company has seen its bottom line balloon on demand for chips that can power the AI boom, like its Blackwell and H200 chips. It was also the first chipmaker to reach a $2 trillion market cap in February, snagging the title of third-most valuable company in the world in March. It was briefly the most valuable company in the world this summer. But shares have been largely trending downward for the past month. Despite an earnings beat that saw record second-quarter revenue of $30 billion for fiscal year 2025 — up 122% from a year ago — Nvidia stock is still down 2% over the past month. Shares fell as much as 12.55% in the days following the its earnings report on Aug. 29. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156% so far this year. And compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Elon Musk is $100 billion richer than in April thanks to Tesla's stock surge — and worth more than McDonald's or Pepsi

Elon Musk is riding high again after a rough start to the year. The Tesla CEO's net worth crashed from $229 billion at the start of January to $164 billion by late April, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period. However, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion. The epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more. Musk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune — worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance. Yet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak. Musk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy. The Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears. The Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company. Consumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said. In April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks. It's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged Thursday after the memory chip maker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations, leading Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks higher. Shares of Micron were up over 12% in intraday trading, while shares of partner Nvidia (NVDA) also gained before reversing course. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) rose as well, boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Nvidia, Micron, and other chip companies have seen their revenue and stock prices climb amid a boom in demand for infrastructure to support artificial intelligence (AI). Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said Wednesday the company's fiscal fourth-quarter sales nearly doubled from a year ago to $7.75 billion, driven by "robust AI demand." Mehrotra also said the company's sales are expected to continue growing, projecting current-quarter revenue could reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion. UPDATE—Sept. 26, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent share price information.

Plus: How Phillip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine’s image with the wildly popular flavored Zyn pouches, which are more profitable than PMI’s cigarette division. Good morning, Sixty-two years after Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, its spectacular success has minted his eldest son as a centibillionaire. Rob Walton became the first member of America’s richest family to hold a 12-figure fortune, worth an estimated $100 billion. Shoppers have flocked to the budget retailer amid high inflation, sending Walmart’s shares up 53% year-to-date. Just 15 other people are worth $100 billion or more, including Elon Musk and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang. With Walmart’s stock market tear, Rob’s siblings Jim and Alice may soon join him in this elite club. Illustration by Alex Castro; Icons by Noun Project A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups offering to connect women to abortion remedies—at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. But the groups are something of a double-edged sword, says Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights. While they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries. New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal criminal charges by a grand jury Wednesday night, capping a series of federal corruption investigations against him and several high-ranking members of his administration. In a defiant video statement shortly before the indictment was reported, Adams said the charges were “entirely false, based on lies” and dismissed calls for him to resign, saying the people of New York “elected me to lead this city, and lead it I will.” Home mortgage rates are posted outside a real estate office in Los Angeles. Since the Federal Reserve’s major interest rate cut last week, yields for 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for loans like mortgages and auto rates, have actually increased. Now expectations have shifted for the Fed to enact another big cut amid mounting evidence that the economy needs even more of a jolt. Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has custody of 11% of all Bitcoin tokens. Now, Brian Armstrong, the company’s chief executive and cofoun­der, wants to disrupt his money machine—the key to that pivot is Base, a system designed to improve upon Ethereum’s blockchain by potentially speeding up transactions. A Delaware court extended an order stalling Bolt founder Ryan Breslow’s bid to raise $450 million, characterizing the deal as a “prisoner’s dilemma” for investors. It’s the latest snag in Breslow’s ongoing bid to raise fresh capital for the struggling payments company, as three irate Bolt investors requested the halt on the Series F financing round—including the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. The Senate voted 78-18 to approve legislation Wednesday to continue funding the government through December 20, narrowly averting a shutdown just five days before the deadline. The short-term spending deal still requires lawmakers to either hash out a funding deal or pass another extension in December, about six weeks after Election Day. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-Md.) was the target of a sophisticated spoofing operation where a video caller used deepfake imagery to pose as a high-level Ukrainian official, according to multiple reports late Wednesday. In a notice reported by NBC News, the Senate security office warned lawmakers about an “active social engineering campaign ... targeting Senators and Senate staff.” President Joe Biden said he was not forced out of the presidential race in his first sit-down interview since his historic decision to end his campaign in July. Biden said on ABC’s The View that he always saw himself as a “transition president,” but insisted he would have beaten former President Donald Trump. The Israeli military is reportedly considering a ground invasion into Lebanon, amid an escalating conflict with Hezbollah that has killed hundreds and threatens to turn into a full-blown war. Late Wednesday, the U.S., France and several key allies issued a statement calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire, noting that the conflict “presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he has not yet responded to the “U.S.-French proposal” and has “instructed the IDF to continue fighting with full force.” Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Since hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, run by billionaire activist investor Paul Singer, announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines, the carrier has made policy changes, upended its board and had its chairman resign. But it’s apparently not enough: On Tuesday, the hedge fund announced it would call for a special meeting at Southwest Airlines “in the coming weeks.” In a letter to shareholders, Elliott accuses Southwest’s leadership of obstructing a leadership change with “a chaotic series of defensive actions.” Illustration by Alex Castro for Forbes; Photos by Helmut Hess, Michael M. Santiago : Getty Images TOPLINE Philip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine’s image with its wildly in-demand flavored Zyn pouches, embraced by celebrities, entrepreneurs and star athletes. By the end of 2024, PMI, which owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, expects to sell as much as 580 million cans of Zyn, a 50% increase over the 385 million sold last year. Forbes estimates that Zyn sales, which PMI does not break out in public filings, generated $1.3 billion last year (about 3.7% of PMI’s $35 billion in total revenue) and could hit $1.9 billion this year. Zyn is six times more profitable than PMI’s cigarette division, says Bonnie Herzog, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the tobacco industry. And unlike cigarettes, which have been steadily declining in volume for the last decade, Zyn is in hypergrowth mode. Shipment volume in the U.S. has jumped a staggering 238% since 2020. But while pouches have successfully divorced nicotine from the cigarette, they still have health risks. Plus, the FDA has not authorized them for sale, although Swedish Match filed an application in March 2020. This means the products are technically illegal, but the FDA is allowing them to stay on the market while the agency reviews applications. And at least five lawsuits allege that PMI is marketing Zyn to minors. “Zyn is Juul 2.0,” says Scott Schlesinger, a Florida-based attorney who recently filed a class action against PMI and Swe­dish Match. But Stacey Kennedy, head of PMI’s U.S. operations, insists that PMI is marketing Zyn only to adults who already smoke or use nicotine. “I think Zyn is proof that nicotine can be used [to replace] more harmful products,” she says. WHY IT MATTERS “Zyn has become a runaway success for PMI. Its newest nicotine product will generate nearly $2 billion in sales this year, Forbes estimates,” says staff writer Will Yakowicz. “But the nicotine pouch is more than just a financial juggernaut—Zyn has spawned its own culture online (also known as the Zynternet), with viral memes and celebrities touting the brand. And it has even entered the presidential election: Ohio Senator JD Vance has been photographed holding a container of Zyn, while on the other side of the aisle, Tim Walz levied a 95% tax on Zyn and other nicotine products as governor of Minnesota.” MORE Meet The Kings Of The Pre-Roll Joint Ozempic may lower the risk of opioid overdose in patients with Type 2 diabetes, a new study suggests. It’s the latest research showing the drug’s positive impact on an unrelated condition: Around 3,000: The number of study participants with Type 2 diabetes and opioid use disorder who were prescribed semaglutide (the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy) About 60%: The decrease in opioid overdoses associated with semaglutide 107,543: The number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023, per CDC data, with opioid-related overdoses making up more than 81,000 of those deaths Soft skills, such as your ability to communicate, are just as critical in your career as hard skills like coding or graphic design. Some of the most important soft skills are public speaking, knowing how to sell and negotiate and project management. Self-awareness might be the most critical: Knowing your strengths and what you need to improve on will help you make real progress in both your personal and professional life.

Micron Technology's (MU) bullish outlook is driving its and chipmaking peers' shares higher in premarket trading; Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to post both quarterly profit and sales gains after the bell; Meta Platforms (META) stock adds to record highs; OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization and give Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman a massive stake; and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell makes his first remarks today after last week's supersized interest-rate cut. U.S. stock futures—especially the tech-dominated Nasdaq—are rising on Micron's rosy outlook after indexes closed mixed Wednesday. Here's what investors need to know today. Micron Technology (MU) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the memory chipmaker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter and almost doubled revenue, buoyed by "robust AI demand," according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Micron's results lifted other chipmakers and semiconductor industry suppliers, with ASML Holding (ASML) jumping 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia all up about 2%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines. It will be the retailer's first results since it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years. Analysts are projecting very little further appreciation for the shares, which are edging higher in premarket trading and have climbed nearly 40% this year. Meta Platforms (META) shares, which hit an all-time high Wednesday, are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after the company unveiled new products at its annual Connect conference. In his keynote address, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new features for its smart glasses made in partnership with Ray-Ban, and new AI features, among other things. OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization, as the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company struggles with an ongoing exodus of key personnel. According to Reuters, which first reported the plan, OpenAI is in talks to give CEO Sam Altman equity worth up to $150 billion, while Bloomberg said the company is discussing giving him a 7% stake. Meanwhile, OpenAI's long-serving Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati was among those to announce a departure Wednesday. It's a big day for Federal Reserve speakers, among them Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Powell's speech will be his first since announcing last week's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut. Investors will also be on the lookout for comments from New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr on the health of the U.S. economy. Data due today include a revised estimate of second-quarter GDP.

More Info The OPEC+ alliance is not discussing any proposals of changes to its current oil production plan, which envisages the group starting to add supply to the market in December, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. OPEC+ initially planned to begin unwinding part of the 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production cuts from October this year. However, after oil prices crashed in late August and early September, OPEC+ delayed the start of the unwinding of the cuts by two months until December 2024. According to Novak, Russia’s top oil official and representative at the OPEC+ meetings, the group, at present, isn’t looking to make any changes to its current production plan. In addition, the Russian official claimed that all OPEC+ producers are currently in full compliance with the agreed output quotas. “All countries are generally fulfilling their obligations under the agreement. We are observing and monitoring the situation on the market in terms of the balance of supply and demand,” Russian news agency Interfax quoted Novak as saying on the sidelines of an energy conference in Russia. Earlier today, reports emerged that Saudi Arabia is determined to begin bringing back production as of December 1, as it now seeks to regain the market share it had lost over the past months with its large output cut. Saudi Arabia is willing to endure short-term oil price and revenue pain as it is making a U-turn in policy and going to take back market share and ditching its unofficial $100 oil price target, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, quoting sources with knowledge of the latest Saudi thinking. This latest thinking suggests that the Kingdom has come to accept that it would have to endure a period of lower oil prices if it wants to take market share back.

Title: BlackRock Continues To Buy Bitcoin: Holdings Now Reach 358,000 BTC Worth $22 Billion

Time Published: 2024-09-26T11:00:19Z
Full Content:
In less than nine months since the launch of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) following the approval of these investment vehicles by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asset manager BlackRock has established itself as the world’s largest Bitcoin fund. According to on-chain data from blockchain analysis platform Arkham, BlackRock has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings through its ETF, known as IBIT over the last months. Despite recent market volatility that saw significant dips in Bitcoin’s price on August 5 and September 6, BlackRock continued to buy more Bitcoin, thereby supporting not only the token’s value but also its own asset base. As of September 25, BlackRock’s holdings have reached approximately 358,000 BTC, valued at around $22.76 billion, representing about 1.70% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million. In comparison, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings exceed those of Grayscale, another major crypto asset manager in the industry, by nearly 100,000 BTC. Grayscale currently holds approximately 258,671 BTC, valued at $16.45 billion, highlighting the significant gap that BlackRock has created in the BTC investment landscape. While BlackRock has taken a commanding lead in Bitcoin, Grayscale maintains an advantage in Ethereum (ETH) holdings. Arkham’s data indicates that Grayscale possesses 2.104 million ETH, valued at roughly $5.45 billion based on the current trading price of $2,600 per ETH. In contrast, BlackRock’s Ethereum holdings amount to only 349,970 ETH, valued at approximately $910 million. BlackRock’s support for Bitcoin extends beyond mere investment; it includes a strong endorsement of the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, challenged the prevailing notion that Bitcoin should be categorized as a “risk-on” asset. During Tuesday’s interview, Mitchnick noted that while Bitcoin has recently shown a high correlation with US equities, this relationship may be misleading. The head of digital assets at BlackRock noted that risk-on assets, such as stocks, commodities, and high-yield bonds, perform well during periods of market optimism and economic growth. Conversely, assets like gold are sought after in times of uncertainty, providing a safe haven for investors. Mitchnick drew parallels between Bitcoin and gold, saying “gold shows a lot of the same patterns”, referring to their temporary correlations with equities. He emphasized that the long-term correlation between BTC and traditional financial assets is close to zero. One of BTC’s defining characteristics is its decentralized nature, Mitchnick added. No single country or government controls it, he said, which adds to its appeal as a global monetary alternative. Mitchnick went on to highlight Bitcoin’s scarcity, global reach and decentralized framework, describing it as a “non-sovereign asset”. He pointed out that BTC has no specific country risk and no counterparty risk, making it a compelling option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has given back some of the gains made during Tuesday’s trading session, after hitting a one-month high of $64,700. Currently, BTC is trading at $63,220, down a slight 0.3% over the 24-hour period.

“We’re at a really exci­ting moment for crypto,” enthuses Brian Armstrong, chief executive and cofoun­der of Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world. “There is a shift happening from crypto being primarily an asset class that people want to trade to speculate on to it becoming more and more used for daily utility,” he insists. “Four hundred million people or so have used crypto globally.” That’s debatable. When it comes to crypto, most people care about pri­ces, and those have been on a tear lately. Bitcoin has more than doubled in the last year to around $58,000. More than 20 crypto ETFs holding $54 billion in digital assets are trading in the U.S. Crypto is more widely held than ever and has become an important topic in the presidential election. With Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried now both in prison, Armstrong has emerged as the movement’s most prominent spokesperson. Photo by Cody Pickens for Forbes Given that Coinbase’s stock mirrors trading in Bitcoin, Armstrong is a billionaire seven times over at age 41. The crypto­currency exchange he cofounded 12 years ago to become the “Gmail for Bitcoin” has a market capitalization of $40 billion and crypto assets under its custody of $270 billion. That includes holding more than $20 billion for BlackRock ($10 trillion in assets under management), now the world’s largest crypto ETF provider. In 2023, the company, which makes around half of its money from trading fees, netted $95 million on revenue of $3.1 billion. This year is on track to be much better: In the first six months of 2024, Coinbase’s revenue amounted to $3.1 billion but net income soared to $1.2 billion. If there were such a thing as a “Too Big to Fail” institution in the world of digital assets, Coinbase would be it. Just in terms of Bitcoin, Coinbase has custody of 11% of all tokens in existence. For crypto’s second-most important currency, Ether, its share is even larger at an estimated 14% of all tokens. If Coinbase imploded, the consequences could be catastrophic. Not everyone is a fan. In June 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase for acting as an unregistered exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm—all activities it engages in for more than 14,500 institutions, as well as 8 million active retail customers. The case is likely to go to trial in 2025. Crypto evangelists hate the idea of centralized power, but operationally, Coinbase is more similar to other command-and-control financial institutions like JPMorgan than it is to something like an employee-owned credit union. Its main businesses are trading, custody and co-mana­ging (with Circle) a huge ($35 billion) stablecoin operation that pegs the value of the USDC token to the U.S. dollar. Coinbase’s dominant position allows it to charge high fees. Purchasing $5,000 of Bitcoin on the exchange will cost you $90. On Kraken it costs $20, and on Robinhood it’s free. But Armstrong is a crypto idealist, and he isn’t entirely happy with this state of affairs. He wants to disrupt his money machine, creating a whole new infrastructure for rapid-fire transactions, which will not only lower fees but also weaken the control of big tech and financial firms. “The whole reason I got into this and the mission of Coinbase is around increasing economic freedom in the world,” he says. “The vision here is that crypto is going to power more and more of global GDP. [It will] create sound money, sound financial infrastructure for people all over the world with lower fees, lower friction.” The key element in Armstrong’s latest corporate push is Base, which launched in August 2023. Base is a so-called Layer 2 platform. Instead of being a self-sufficient blockchain like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, it is designed to improve upon Ethereum by potentially processing thousands of transactions per second, costing less than a cent each. Ethereum can handle only about a dozen transactions per second, each costing an average of $1. It’s a huge improvement, but still far less than existing financial networks. Visa’s global processing network, VisaNet, can handle 65,000 transactions a second. Armstrong would like his low-cost Base to be interoperable with other Ethereum-based blockchains and support decentralized versions of Facebook, YouTube, Google, Uber and X. He’s also onboarding merchants ranging from Anheuser-Busch to Wharton business school using his Coinbase Commerce service, taking aim at the likes of PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, which charge fees as high as 3% per transaction. Coinbase Commerce charges only 1%. But consumer adoption has been slow. The network processes fewer than 2,000 transactions daily. Visa does that many every second. “Some of these businesses might have only 5% margins, and 2% of it is going to the card network,” Armstrong says. “There’s no reason it needs to be this way. It’s an unnecessary tax on the economy.” According to Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, Base’s estimated 1 million active users are expec­ted to contribute $100 million to Coinbase’s revenue in 2024. Most of that is from trading fees (this is crypto, after all). Ironically, if Coinbase is going to be even more successful with Base, it will have to give up control—and share fees. Coinbase is currently Base’s only “sequencer,” crypto jargon for operator or supervisor. To become decentralized, Base will require more sequencers. If Base had four sequen­cers, Coinbase might earn only 25% of the total fees. Talk of lower fees and revenue dilution may not win Coinbase long-term fans on Wall Street. In the short term, shareholders don’t seem to mind. Shares of Coinbase have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. As long as the price of crypto keeps soaring—and the geeks keep tra­ding it—Armstrong can spout as much idealistic claptrap as he wants.

Title: Nvidia Stock -- The Road To $200

Visitors check out Nvidia's AI technology at the 2024 Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, China, on ... [+] September 19, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock reach $200 in the next two years? We think there is a possibility. How? Consider this, just about nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2x since and trades at close to $116 presently. Looking at valuations, Nvidia stock trades at about 95x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not really. Especially if you consider the company’s steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia’s formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. The Fed’s recent rate cut could also provide a boost as investors seek growth opportunities in a low-rate environment. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia’s revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $200 stock price. Nvidia’s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years, its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to around $155 billion by fiscal year 2026 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3-D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power, particularly with processors, outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. Moreover, last week’s monetary easing by the Federal Reserve could provide an additional boost to Nvidia. The Fed’s 0.5% rate cut last Wednesday marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia’s downside to $40. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. To put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled over 800% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular, as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from levels of about 25% in FY 2019 to about 49% in FY 2024 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia’s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures. Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 40x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 95x now to about 40x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 65x looks quite likely. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock about $200 within the next two years or so a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.

William R. Keating, the congress member representing Massachusetts's 9th congressional district, recently made several transactions from his Individual Retirement Account (IRA), as per the latest congressional trade report. Among the most notable transactions, Keating sold a portion of his holdings in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Inc. Common Stock (NYSE:CAT) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) N.V. - Common Stock (NASDAQ:NXPI). Both transactions were valued between $1,001 and $15,000. In addition to the above, Keating also partially sold his holdings in several corporate securities, including those from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) & Co, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Elevance Health Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, T-Mobile USA Inc, Union Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP), and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). Each of these transactions was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Interestingly, two transactions stood out with a higher value. Keating partially sold his holdings in a Comcast Corp note, valued between $15,001 and $50,000. Furthermore, he sold his United States Treasury Series C-2032 note, also valued between $15,001 and $50,000. All transactions were conducted on September 11, 2024, and were reported on September 23, 2024. These trades, as per the report, were made from Keating's IRA, an investment vehicle commonly used by individuals to earmark funds for retirement savings. As investors keep a keen eye on the financial activities of influential figures like congress members, these transactions by Keating provide useful insights. However, as always, it's essential for investors to conduct their own research and consider various factors before making investment decisions. As William R. Keating adjusts his investment portfolio, it's worth noting the recent performance and outlook of Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT), one of the stocks he has sold. According to InvestingPro data, Caterpillar has a robust market capitalization of $183.7 billion and has been demonstrating financial resilience. The company's P/E ratio stands at 17.2, reflecting a valuation that is attractive relative to near-term earnings growth, an observation that aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in the context of its earnings growth. Investors tracking dividend reliability will find Caterpillar's dividend history compelling, as the company has not only maintained dividend payments for an impressive 54 consecutive years but has also raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years. This consistency in rewarding shareholders is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to returning value to its investors, a point that is underscored by two separate InvestingPro Tips. For those looking at stock performance, Caterpillar has delivered a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 16.0%. This robust short-term performance is part of a longer trend, as the company has also enjoyed a high return over the last decade. Caterpillar's operational strength is further reflected in its gross profit margin of 32.72% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating a healthy ability to manage costs and sustain profitability. For investors interested in a deeper dive into Caterpillar's financials and performance metrics, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights. There are currently 15 InvestingPro Tips available for Caterpillar, which provide a comprehensive analysis for those looking to make informed investment decisions.

Title: TSMC shares hold as JPMorgan reiterates overweight rating

On Thursday, JPMorgan maintained its Overweight rating and NT$1,200.00 price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (2330:TT) (NYSE:TSM), citing expectations for a robust third-quarter earnings report. The firm anticipates that TSMC's revenue will slightly exceed the upper end of the company's forecast, with projected revenues of US $23.3 billion against guidance of US$22.4-23.2 billion. Gross margins (GMs) are also expected to be at the high end of TSMC's forecast, with an estimate of 54.8% compared to the projected range of 53.5-55.5%. The positive outlook is partly attributed to the strong growth in the N3 technology node, which is used for the latest iPhone builds and new application processors from companies like Mediatek and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Additionally, the N4 node, primarily utilized for AI accelerators, is expected to contribute to the company's revenue growth. JPMorgan forecasts a quarter-over-quarter revenue increase of approximately 10% for the fourth quarter of 2024 due to these factors. JPMorgan also anticipates that TSMC will continue to communicate strong demand trends for its N3 technology and a persistent supply-demand gap for advanced packaging solutions, particularly the Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) technology. The firm's outlook is bolstered by the expectation that 2025 will be a strong year for TSMC. This optimism is based on the sustained demand for AI accelerators, the expansion of N3 engagements beyond Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and an anticipated uptick in gross margins due to improved yields and potential price increases for the N3E technology node. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) has reported significant growth in its second quarter of 2024, with a sequential revenue increase of 13.6% in NT dollars and 10.3% in USD. The company's gross margin rose to 53.2%, and its operating margin reached 42.5%. TSMC's High-Performance Computing (HPC) segment accounted for more than half of the total revenue for the first time, standing at 52%. The company revised its full-year revenue guidance to a growth rate slightly above the mid-20s percent in USD terms. BofA Securities maintained a positive outlook on TSMC, reiterating a Buy rating. The firm highlighted the upcoming delivery of a high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool to TSMC from ASML (AS:ASML), which is expected to enhance the company's capabilities in developing advanced semiconductor processes. TSMC's August financial report showed a revenue of NT$251 billion, a 2% decrease month-over-month but a 33% increase year-over-year. Bernstein SocGen Group updated its outlook on TSMC, increasing the price target to $220 from the previous $200, and retaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm suggests TSMC is well-positioned to perform better than its peers should a recession occur, due to its advanced technologies and market share gains. Finally, TSMC's capital expenditure for 2024 is projected to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion, primarily allocated to advanced process technologies. As Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) approaches its next earnings date on October 17, 2024, the company's financial health and market performance remain a focal point for investors. With a market capitalization of $803.45 billion and a P/E ratio of 27.72, TSMC stands as a significant player in the semiconductor industry. In the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, TSMC has reported a revenue growth of 9.44%, showcasing its ability to expand amidst a dynamic tech landscape. This is further evidenced by a substantial quarterly revenue growth of 40.07% in Q2 2024, highlighting the company's strong performance in the short term. InvestingPro Tips suggest that TSMC's robust gross profit margin of 53.36% aligns with JPMorgan's expectations of high-end gross margins for the company. Additionally, with a dividend growth of 42.6% in the same period, TSMC demonstrates its commitment to returning value to shareholders. It's worth noting that the InvestingPro product lists 15 additional tips that can provide deeper insights into TSM's financial health and investment potential. Investors may also find TSMC's price resilience of interest, with the stock trading at 94.25% of its 52-week high. This, combined with a year-to-date price total return of 76.84%, positions TSMC favorably in the eyes of growth-oriented investors. The company's fair value, as assessed by analysts, stands at $214, while InvestingPro's fair value estimation is at $161.5, offering a perspective on the stock's potential undervaluation or overvaluation.

Title: Dublin woman in Vancouver: Finding work has been hard but Ironman gives me purpose
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/abroad/2024/09/26/life-in-vancouver-and-its-hurdles-for-an-irishwoman-throwing-herself-into-ironman/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
I’m from Blackrock, Dublin, and in March, I left Ireland to travel through Asia and America before landing in Vancouver, Canada, in July. When I decided to move here alone, I knew it would be challenging, but I didn’t fully grasp just how much. The city is beautiful, but the reality of being in a new place, with no job and no familiar faces, hit me hard. The loneliness could have been overwhelming, but I chose a different path – I set goals, achievable ones, that would help me find purpose and direction. Life in Vancouver, however, has its own set of hurdles. The job market here has been slow, and finding work has been tougher than I anticipated. Yet, instead of letting this get me down. I have thrown myself into my training daily. Training gives me purpose when everything else feels uncertain, I’ve learned. It structures my days, filling them with meaning and direction. One of the most ambitious goals I have set for myself is to complete my first full-distance Ironman 140.6 in Tempe Arizona in November (which consists of a 3.9km swim, a 180.2km bicycle race and then a 42.2km run, for a total of 226.3km – or 140.6 miles). Before taking on that challenge, I aimed to complete an official Ironman 70.3 in Penticton, British Columbia, on August 25th. The race was supposed to be a straightforward test of endurance, but the universe had other plans. On the morning of the race, the water temperature unexpectedly dropped to 10 degrees, forcing the organisers to cancel the swim. It was a curveball I didn’t expect, but I pushed forward, completing the bike and run portions and finishing in less than six hours. Obstacles in life are inevitable, but it is how we react to these that matters most. My dream is not just to compete, but to guide others, particularly disabled athletes, through the world of triathlons and Ironman races Crossing that finish line was a mix of frustration and triumph. The swim cancellation was disappointing, but it didn’t overshadow the sense of achievement I felt. This race was a stepping stone, a necessary part of my journey toward the full Ironman. I’m self-coached, driven by a passion that I hope will one day lead me to become a coach myself. My dream is not just to compete, but to guide others, particularly disabled athletes, through the world of triathlons and Ironman races. Each day I lace up my running shoes or hop on my bike, I’m not just working toward my goals, I’m building a foundation for my future. [ Why many Irish people chose Vancouver to go for a holiday or a longer stayOpens in new window ] [ A second life in Vancouver: ‘I made the decision to get away from any potential downward spiral into addiction’Opens in new window ] Without this focus, I think the loneliness would have been unbearable. Every run, every ride, every session, is a step closer to my goals – not just the physical ones, but the personal ones too. When you feel lost, set a goal. When you feel overwhelmed, take the first step. You’ll be amazed at what you can achieve when you give yourself direction. As a young woman navigating life in a new city, it’s crucial to carve out your own path, to find out who you are and what you’re made of. This journey has been about more than just completing races, I realise. It’s been about building resilience, finding inner strength and creating a future that I’m excited about. By the time I crossed the finish line in Penticton, I was physically exhausted but emotionally charged. There was no one waiting for me, no familiar face in the crowd to share the moment with, but I realised that didn’t diminish the victory. I celebrated myself, recognising that this was more than just the end of a race, it was a milestone in my journey of self-discovery and growth. In that moment, I understood that this period of my life, with all its challenges and solitude, was shaping me into someone stronger, more resilient and more self-reliant. [ Irish abroad: The seven stages of moving to a new countryOpens in new window ] The race isn’t just about finishing, it’s about finding out what you’re capable of, and realising that the journey itself is just as important as the destination. So, for anyone feeling lost or uncertain, set your sights on something that excites you, challenges you, and pushes you forward. Take the leap, set the goal and watch yourself grow in ways you never imagined. The road ahead is still long, with many miles left to cover, but I’m ready for it. Each day, I’m becoming more of the person I want to be – stronger, more focused and driven by a passion to not just cross my own finish lines but to help others cross theirs too.

Title: Opportunity knocks for a new group of players on Emerging Ireland tour
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/09/26/opportunity-knocks-for-a-new-group-of-players-on-emerging-ireland-tour/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa in 2022 will serve as a benchmarking process, directly and indirectly, for the current squad who depart on Saturday for their three-match assignment in the land of the world champions. Simon Easterby, head coach again as he was two years ago, mentioned that half a dozen players from that Emerging Ireland squad went on to make their senior Test debuts. On Wednesday, backs coach Andrew Goodman figured that the aforementioned group had accumulated around 50 caps since then. As an initiative it was an unqualified success despite initial misgivings in some quarters, and the hope is that it will again provide a similar pathway for another tranche of players. Goodman is Ireland’s new backs coach, having moved from Leinster at the end of last season. He shadowed his predecessor Mike Catt during Ireland’s two Test drawn series against the Springboks and now returns to South Africa. The New Zealander is delighted to have a whistle around his neck again. He is relishing the first pitch session at the IRFU High-Performance Centre, where he will get to work with some of his previous charges at Leinster and a selection of the best young players from the other provinces. Goodman said: “We want to build depth and have competition in positions. We want guys to have that opportunity, see them in our structures, see how they play, how they learn. It’s just [discovering] that Irish way of doing things that is different to the way the provinces do things. “A lot of it is around our language, a little bit around how we want to play the game. The provinces are doing an amazing job, all the lads are very well coached. We are just trying to build on that but also add our flavour and what makes us [Ireland] different. “It’s a great opportunity for these boys to come in and experience what [senior] Test weeks are like and how they take on information and put that on to the field. It is important that they take it in from the first day. We can’t have people waiting around and holding back. We need them to come and put their best foot forward straight away.” Goodman said that time spent with his new coaching colleagues in the senior Irish set-up during the summer was invaluable. “In terms of South Africa, it was a great little introduction to see how the Irish set-up works, the language they use and how the week is run. “It was a great experience, and I suppose the energy they all came in with, the way they connected and the level of expectation around the way they do things, that accountability was huge. You could obviously see from the outside that it was a well-connected group. It was just great to see first-hand that energy and connection that they drove. “It was great to get a step ahead coming into the Emerging Ireland tour now and with November later on, so I guess there are differences in the way weeks are run but nothing major.” Goodman will be responsible for the team attack with Emerging Ireland before paring back the role a little in November when head coach Andy Farrell is in charge once again. Goodman said: “I’ll be doing a lot of work with the backs on strikes [moves] from scrum and lineout and on skill work for the team and assisting Andy, obviously, when it comes to November time. He’s not coming on this trip, so [I] get to do a little bit more of the team attack as well, but I’ll be assisting him with those bits of the attack when it comes to November and beyond.” Ireland’s three tour matches against the Pumas, Western Force and the Cheetahs will be broadcast on the IRFU’s new streaming platform IrishRugby+, a sports innovation project with Enterprise Ireland and the Cork-based company, Wiistream. IrishRugby+ will stream selected games free from the men’s and women’s Energia All-Ireland Leagues (AIL) as well as carry additional games such as the upcoming Emerging Ireland tour.

Title: Watch These Meta Platforms Price Levels as Stock Sets Record High
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-meta-platforms-price-levels-stock-sets-record-high-8718613
Time Published: 2024-09-26T02:06:11Z
Full Content:
Meta Platforms (META) shares will likely remain in focus for the remainder of the week after the tech titan’s stock set a record high on Wednesday and the company kicked off its annual Connect conference. The company unveiled a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new artificial intelligence (AI) features, and other tech gadgets at the highly anticipated event. The Facebook and Instagram parent has also turned to celebrities, announcing deals with actors Awkwafina, John Cena, and Judi Dench, among others, that will allow the company to use their voices in a new AI assistant. Since the start of the year, Meta’s stock has gained around 60% through Wednesday’s close as the social media company's latest quarterly results indicate that significant investments in AI infrastructure and product innovations have started to translate into higher advertising revenue and earnings. Meta shares gained 0.9% on Wednesday to finish at $568.31, after surging to an all-time high of $576.88 during the session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta’s chart and identify important price levels to watch out for. Meta shares broke out from a five-month ascending triangle on above-average volume earlier this month, with the stock price continuing to track higher into its Connect 2024 conference. The stock’s breakout coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving into overbought territory to confirm bullish price momentum but also caution of short-term stretched conditions. To forecast potential price targets above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), investors can use the measuring principle and a more subjective bars pattern. Let’s look at each in further detail. To project a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance of the ascending triangle near its widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $165 to $535, which forecasts an upside target in the stock at $700. Speculating an upside target using a bars pattern works by using a prior trending move to forecast a potential future move, assuming price action tends to rhyme. In this case, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December to March and reposition it from this month’s low, which projects a price target of around $790. We selected this prior move because it commenced from an earlier ascending triangle’s lower trendline on Meta’s chart, similar to the stock’s price action from the most recent ascending triangle. Given the RSI indicator points to overbought conditions in the stock, investors should also keep a close eye on the $535 level, an area on the chart where prior resistance could become future support near the ascending triangle's upper trendline. Market participants who prefer to trade pullbacks rather than chase breakouts could look for buying opportunities near this area.

September 25, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Indivior class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/INDV CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit. For more information on the CrowdStrike class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRWD DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Class Period: May 26, 2021 - May 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants misrepresented its ongoing “transformation journey” and the Company’s ability to integrate previously acquired companies and business systems. While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its “cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.” These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC’s CEO admitted that “the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth” because the systems that were acquired over time were “never integrated, never deduped,” and admitted that the Company was “not [a] fully functional organization.” DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share. For more information on the DXC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DXC Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below’s financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below’s statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.” At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2024 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. Beginning on July 19, 2024, investors learned about critical issues with CrowdStrike’s technology when a single update pushed by CrowdStrike caused outages for millions of users of Microsoft Windows devices worldwide, including financial institutions, government entities, and corporations. Further, CrowdStrike disclosed that the outages had left users vulnerable to potential hacking threats. On this news, shares of CrowdStrike fell $38.09 or 11% to close at $304.96 on July 19, 2024. Then, on July 22, 2024, the fallout of the outages was further revealed as Congress called on Defendant Kurtz to testify regarding the crisis and the Company’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, shares of CrowdStrike fell $41.05 or 13.5% to close at $263.91 on July 22, 2024. Investors continued to learn about the legal risk Defendants had concealed on July 29,2024, as news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from the Company following the outages. On this news, shares of CrowdStrike fell $25.16 or 10% to close at $233.65 on July 30, 2024. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding CrowdStrike’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the CrowdStrike class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/CRWD or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, has recently sold a portion of his holdings in the company. The transaction, which took place on September 23, involved the sale of 10,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $569.93 per share, amounting to a total of over $5.6 million. This sale was conducted under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to sell shares at a predetermined time to avoid accusations of trading on nonpublic information. The shares sold by Cox were held by the Christopher K. Cox Revocable Trust, for which he is the trustee. Following the sale, Cox's trust still retains a significant stake in the company, with 328,662 shares of Meta Platforms' Class A common stock remaining. Additionally, Cox is associated with the Cox-Vadakan Irrevocable Remainder Trust, which holds 55,046 shares. Investors often monitor insider sales as they may provide insights into executives' views on the company's current valuation and future prospects. However, it is important to note that such transactions do not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company; they may be part of personal financial planning or diversification strategies. Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in the technology sector, specifically within the computer programming and data processing industry. The company has made significant strides in recent years to expand its offerings beyond social media, delving into areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality. The sale by Cox was officially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 25, with Erin Guldiken signing as attorney-in-fact for Christopher K. Cox. As insiders' transactions are publicly disclosed, investors have the opportunity to stay informed about the financial moves of Meta Platforms' top executives.

Despite technical challenges, Meta continues to invest heavily in AI and AR technologies, with projected capital expenses for 2024 estimated to be between $37 billion to $40 billion. Simultaneously, Meta has decided to hold off on joining the European Union's AI Pact, focusing instead on complying with the upcoming EU's Artificial Intelligence Act. The Act, set to be implemented by August 2, 2026, will require companies to provide detailed accounts of the data used to train their AI models. In the financial realm, both Roth Capital and BofA Securities have provided positive outlooks on Meta's shares. Roth Capital highlighted a steady increase in the company's cost per thousand impressions, a key indicator of robust advertising demand. BofA Securities maintained its Buy rating for Meta, anticipating the launch of advanced AI chat options and new AI capabilities for WhatsApp and Messenger. In its push towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits in a deal with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm, marking the company's most significant carbon removal procurement from a single project to date. This is part of Meta's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. Lastly, Meta along with other tech giants is engaged with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act. The companies are participating in the drafting of the codes of practice for the new legislation, expected to be finalized by late next year.

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged in extended trading Wednesday as the company's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit of $887 million or 79 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, from a loss of $1.43 billion or $1.31 per share a year ago. Revenue nearly doubled to $7.75 billion, topping analysts' estimates. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the revenue gains were driven by “robust AI demand," and that the company is moving into fiscal 2025 “with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history." Micron said it expects current-quarter revenue to reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, with the low end of that range above the analyst consensus. The company's projection for diluted earnings per share (EPS) of between $1.46 and $1.62 also exceeded estimates. Shares of Micron jumped more than 13% to $108.34 in extended trading Wednesday following the release.

Shares of Texas-based power generator Vistra (VST) surged nearly 6% higher on Wednesday, the largest daily gain of any S&P 500 stock. Vistra is no stranger to market-leading upticks, having surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the benchmark index this year. Despite the run-up in Vistra's stock price in 2024, several investment firms suggested there could be more upside potential for shares of the utility company. In research notes published this week, Jefferies boosted its price target on Vistra shares to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley lifted its target on the stock to $132 from $110. Analysts described catalysts that could help Vistra stock extend its march higher. Jefferies pointed to the firm's acquisition last week of the remaining 15% noncontrolling interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which includes nuclear generation facilities as well other renewable and energy-storage assets. Analysts equated the Vision deal to buying back shares at a discount. The report from Jefferies also focused on the recent announcement from fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) that it will restart a shuttered nuclear plant to provide power to Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The analyst team believes the deal "confirms and expands" their thesis that Vistra stands to benefit from data-center opportunities, while the terms of the 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Constellation and the software giant set a precedent for lucrative agreements in the future. So far in 2024, Vistra shares have more than tripled in value.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Wednesday as the upbeat mood that followed last week's interest-rate cut showed signs of dissipating. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on the day, receding from the all-time closing high posted in the previous session. The Dow fell 0.7%, failing to extend its streak of four consecutive record closes. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal daily gain of less than 0.1%. Shares of the financial technology company Global Payments (GPN) plunged 6.5%, posting the widest loss of any stock in the S&P 500 for the second straight day. The payment solutions provider issued underwhelming profit guidance at an investor conference earlier this week, noting it expects a year of transition in fiscal 2025. Analysts at the financial firm BTIG downgraded Global Payment stock to neutral, citing a lack of visibility in the company's growth trajectory that they believe leaves the stock in "no man's land" over the coming quarters. Amgen (AMGN) shares lost 5.5% after the drugmaker released data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of an experimental eczema treatment. Although Amgen's drug met its primary endpoint in the study, analysts question whether the results were strong enough for the treatment to merit a strong share in a market already served by Dupixent, a medication jointly developed by Amgen rivals Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron (REGN). Shares of major U.S. automakers moved lower following unfavorable comments from analysts at Morgan Stanley. The investment firm downgraded General Motors (GM) to "underweight" from "equal weight" and scaled back its view on Ford Motor (F) to "equal weight" from "overweight," citing increased competition in China and a challenging environment for U.S. consumers. GM shares were down 4.9% on Wednesday, while Ford shares slid 4.1%. Vistra (VST) shares soared 5.9%, securing the S&P 500's top daily performance after Jefferies and Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on the utility stock. Analysts reacted positively to Vistra's recent acquisition of the remaining stake in its Vistra Vision subsidiary. In addition, the analysts said they believe the recent deal by fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) to power Microsoft (MSFT) data centers sets a positive precedent for other attractive agreements. Constellation Energy shares were up 3.7% on the day. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) jumped 5.1% as Barclays upgraded the stock to "overweight" and lifted its price target. Analysts pointed to signs of recovery in the enterprise hardware business and said they view HPE stock as one of the best ways to invest in this trend. Barclays also believes HPE can continue to increase sales of its artificial intelligence (AI) servers, make gains in the storage market, and benefit from its acquisition of Juniper Networks (JNPR) announced at the beginning of the year. Intel (INTC) shares added 3.2%, extending strong gains posted this week amid reports of a potential investment of up to $5 billion from asset management firm Apollo Global Management. Intel has also reportedly drawn interest from fellow chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM). In addition, Intel launched two new AI products on Tuesday that are central to its strategy of improving its position in the data center market.

Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting growth on the top and bottom lines—but very little further appreciation for the shares. The membership-based bulk retailer has seen its stock climb about 40% this year. Of the 19 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 13 have a buy rating on Costco's stock. The consensus price target of $912.94 represents only a slim premium to Wednesday's close of $908.42. Costco is projected to report $2.27 billion in net income on just shy of $79.96 billion in revenue, up from $2.2 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively, a year earlier. Investors will be watching closely for the company’s first results since raising its membership price for the first time in seven years.

A sign announces the closing of the observation center for the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in ... [+] Pennsylvania, following an accident on March 28, 1979. A pump failed in the reactor cooling system, shutting down the plant and threatening a nuclear meltdown. (Photo by Owen Franken/Corbis via Getty Images) Nvidia stock has soared 156% in 2024. Meanwhile, shares of Constellation Energy — a provider of nuclear power services and owner of the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania that suffered an accident in March 1979 — have risen 129%. Constellation — which recently signed a 10-year agreement for Microsoft to pay the nuclear energy leader about $16 billion, according to Seeking Alpha — could be a better investment than Nvidia. Here are three reasons: One downside to consider is that analysts’ price targets fully capture Constellation’s upside, according to TipRanks. The demand for energy to operate data centers is forecast to rise as Nvidia revenue growth slows. U.S. power demand has remained roughly unchanged between 2014 and 2024, noted TheStreet. However overall power demand in data centers is projected to surge “160% by 2030,” according to a May 2024 Goldman Sachs report. To be sure, demand for AI-related hardware and software is also forecast to grow rapidly. More specifically, Bain estimates the total addressable market will increase by 40% to 55% annually, ranging between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027, according to Barron’s. While Nvidia expects to grow faster than the industry, the AI chip designer’s revenue growth is slowing down. Nvidia’s revenues grew in a range of 206% to 265%, between the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, according to Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia is still growing rapidly — but at a lower rate. For instance, the AI chip designer’s revenue increased 122% in the second quarter of 2024 and the company forecasts 80% growth in the third quarter of 2024, I noted in a September post on Forbes. Constellation Energy operates the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear power plants, which is the preferred electricity-generating fuel for tech companies, according to Seeking Alpha. In February 2022, Constellation was spun off from utility company, Exelon. Constellation stock surged 22% on September 20 following the announcement of a 20-year deal with Microsoft to supply electricity from a $1.6 billion restart of the undamaged 835-megawatt nuclear Unit 1 of Three Mile Island — which “closed under economic pressure” in 2019, noted the Wall Street Journal. The facility’s Unit 2 was shut down in 1979 after a partial core meltdown. The resulting five days of panic “heightened awareness of nuclear plants’ potential safety problems and contributed to a loss of enthusiasm for the industry that lasted decades,” the Journal reported. The company’s latest financial report for the June 2024-ending quarter fell short of earnings and revenue expectations. However, Constellation Energy raised its earnings per share forecast for 2024. Specifically, the company’s EPS of $1.68 was four cents below the consensus estimate while the company’s $5.48 billion in revenue fell $70 million short of analysts’ consensus forecast, noted TheStreet. Constellation raised its adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2024 by 4.8% to $8 a share at the midpoint of the range — 19 cents more than the consensus, TheStreet reported. Might this boost in Constellation’s earnings growth target foreshadow expectations-beating revenue growth? Analysts lifted the company’s stock price target significantly in the wake of the company’s deal with Microsoft. Examples include: Other analysts were bullish on Constellation. While Guggenheim's Shahriar Pourreza added “the hyperscaler demand for clean megawatts is real,” Mizuho's Maheep Mandloi indicated the arrangement “points to the need for 24×7 clean energy to meet data center needs,” MarketWatch noted. To be sure, anti-nuclear sentiment — while negative at times — is arguably less pronounced than in the past. With state and federal governments urging utilities to use nuclear and renewables fuel to make electricity, Constellation has more support than before. Moreover, since it requires “neither expensive battery storage nor quick-on extra natural gas capacity equal to 110% of renewable capacity,” nuclear has advantages over renewables, reported TheStreet. It appears Wall Street still sees more upside to Nvidia stock. The 42 analysts covering the AI chip designer set an average price target of $152 — representing 24% upside, according to TipRanks, which notes Constellation’s average price target of $214 from 20 analysts makes the stock about 1% overvalued.

Title: Congress Slams CrowdStrike (CRWD) for July Failure - Hagens Berman

September 25, 2024 15:02 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. “This was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,” Green declared, “and we cannot let it happen again.” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress’ interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

Mark Zuckerberg is trying once again to bring VR to the masses, this time through a new Quest 3S headset that arrives next month starting at $299. The device promises to offer the same high-quality VR experience found in last year’s pricier Quest 3, for $200 less. “We’ve been working on bringing the Quest 3 family to a lot more people,” Zuckerberg said at the Meta Connect conference on Wednesday. The resulting Quest 3S looks similar, but Meta is indicating it reduced the product’s cost by changing the lens inside the headset. The new headset uses a “fresnel lens” with a lower resolution of 1,832 by 1,920 or 773 pixels per inch. The Quest 3, on the other hand, features “pancake lenses,” which can offer a higher resolution at 2,064 by 2,208 or 1218ppi. In addition, the 3S has a lower field of view at 96 degrees versus 110 degrees, according to the company’s comparison page. The other noticeable change is the exterior cameras, which are positioned differently, although both VR headsets offer full color passthrough, enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while wearing the device. The passthrough is the key to both the Quest 3 and 3S offering a "mixed reality" experience, meaning you can overlay virtual icons and windows on real-world sights. This will eventually include running the Windows OS remotely though the headset, according to Zuckerberg. On the plus side, the 3S can run a little longer, at 2.5 hours per battery charge, despite having a slightly smaller battery. Both headsets also use the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 processor and contain 8GB of RAM, which is perhaps why Zuckerberg said the 3S offers the same “defining features” as the Quest 3, including hand-tracking. The company is marketing the Quest 3S for people new to mixed reality experiences, or “who might have been waiting for a low-cost upgrade.” Preorders for Quest 3S start today with the company charging $299 for the 128GB model and $399 for the 256GB model. The product is then slated to start shipping on Oct. 15. Stay tuned for our review. Meta is also cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 from $649.99 to $499. The 128GB version of the Quest 3, which also goes for $499, is out of stock.

Title: Google paid $2.7B to rehire AI genius who left after company refused to release his bot: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/business/google-paid-2-7b-to-rehire-ai-genius-who-left-for-startup/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T18:29:46Z
Full Content:
Google paid $2.7 billion to rehire an artificial intelligence genius who left the tech giant in a huff three years ago to found his own startup, according to a report. Noam Shazeer, a 48-year-old software engineer who was first hired by Google as one of its first few hundred employees back in 2000, left the company in 2021 after it refused his request to release a chat bot that he had developed with a colleague, Daniel De Freitas. Shazeer and De Freitas went on to found Character.AI, which grew to become one of the hottest AI startups in Silicon Valley that would eventually reach a $1 billion valuation last year. Last month, Google and Character.AI announced that Shazeer, De Freitas and certain members of Character.AI’s research team would be joining Google’s AI unit DeepMind. At the time of the deal, Character.AI said that it had more than 20 million monthly active users. Google paid Character.AI $2.7 billion to license its technology as well as to get Shazeer and his team to agree to work for the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The licensing deal, which is short of a full-fledged acquisition, is a unique arrangement that allows Google to immediately access Character.AI’s intellectual property without having to wait for the regulatory approvals and bureaucratic sign-offs that would have been required if the company was bought outright. Shazeer’s return to Google is widely viewed among company employees as the primary reason behind the acquisition of Character.AI, the Journal reported. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, was reportedly impressed with Shazeer — so much so that he was convinced he would be able to build an AI model that could operate with human-level intelligence, according to the Journal. “If there’s anybody I can think of in the world who’s likely to do it, it’s going to be him,” Schmidt was quoted as saying of Shazeer during a talk at Stanford University in 2015. In 2017, Shazeer and another Google colleague, De Freitas, teamed up to create Meena, a chat bot that could engage humans on a range of issues. According to the Journal, Shazeer was so confident of Meena’s utility that he predicted it would one day replace Google’s search engine. But Google executives thought it was too risky to release Meena due to concerns about safety and fairness, the Journal reported. Google tapped Shazeer, who netted hundreds of millions of dollars in the transaction, to be one of three people who will lead the company’s efforts to build the next version of Gemini, Google’s next-generation AI model that was built to compete with rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Earlier this year, Google temporarily suspended Gemini’s image-generating feature after it produced inaccurate “woke” depictions such as minority founding father and diverse popes. Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Last month, Google lifted the suspension and allowed users to create images using prompts after fixing the bugs. The steep price that Google paid to bring Shazeer and De Freitas back into the fold is indicative of the expensive race among Silicon Valley tech giants to hire the best talent during the AI era — particularly in the wake of OpenAI’s rollout of ChatGPT. The talent wars have heated up to the point where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google co-founder Sergey Brin personally wrote notes to recruits urging them to come aboard. Brin is reportedly the key figure in helping to persuade Shazeer to return to Google, according to the Journal. Companies like OpenAI pay prized recruits compensation packages ranging from $5 million to $10 million — mostly in the form of stock. Meta has developed a reputation for being somewhat stingy, offering pay packages of between $1 million and $2 million, according to data unearthed by the tech-centric news site The Information.

Title: CRWD FINAL DEADLINE: ROSEN, A LEADING LAW FIRM, Encourages CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. Investors with Losses in Excess of $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important September 30 Deadline in Securities Class Action – CRWD

September 25, 2024 14:22 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Meta will stop selling the Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year

Meta just revealed the budget-friendly Quest 3S VR headset at its annual Connect keynote event, but it also made a sad announcement about some of its previous headsets. The company will stop selling both the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro by the end of the year. “With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first,” the company wrote in a blog post that also announced the pending launch of the Quest 3S. The company will be selling Quest 2 and Pro accessories for “a bit longer” after the stock of headsets runs out. This includes the carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers and bundles like the Quest 2 Active Pack. Meta recently lowered the price of the Quest 2 to $200, and it’s still a decent headset for beginners. The Quest 3S is better in every way, but it starts at $300, while the standard Quest 3 costs $500. It’s the end of an era for the Quest 2. This was a hugely successful headset, as it launched during the dog days of COVID-19. For many, it became a crucial item to survive endless isolation, along with stuff like Zoom and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It’s the end of an error (see what I did there?) for the Quest Pro. This headset never caught on, likely because it was originally priced at $1,500 before being quickly lowered to $1,000. It still costs a grand from Meta, but can typically be found for around $900 via Amazon and other retailers. As they say, out with the old and in with the new. The Quest 3S is, essentially, the new Quest 2. It starts at $300, boasts the same CPU as the original Quest 3 and handles full-color passthrough.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Meta Quest 3S is Meta's new budget-friendly standalone VR headset, and you can preorder now ahead of its October 15 release. By Steven Petite on September 26, 2024 at 3:57PM PDT Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $300 Meta Quest 3S (256GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $400 Meta Quest 3 (512GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $500 The newly announced Meta Quest 3S has a pretty awesome launch bundle that makes the already budget-friendly headset more enticing. From now until April 30, 2025, while supplies last, the Quest 3S will come bundled with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a Quest 3-exclusive action game that pits the Caped Crusader against the Rat King. The Meta Quest 3S launch bundle is available in both storage configurations: 128GB for $300 and 256GB for $400. Preorders are live now at multiple major retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, ahead of the headset's October 15 release date. Announced during Meta Connect 2024, the Quest 3S has the same chipset as the standard Quest 3, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, and the same amount of RAM (8GB). Just like with the Quest 3, you'll get a pair of Touch Pro controllers that support gesture controls to navigate menus. Battery life, according to Meta, is slightly better with the Quest 3S, with an average playtime between charges of two-and-a-half hours instead of two hours with the regular Quest 3. Where it cuts costs is with the lenses. The Quest 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the pricier Meta Quest 3 has 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for improved resolution and clarity. In addition to the lower-resolution lenses, the Quest 3S drops the depth sensor and has a narrower field of vision. Meta also significantly reduced the price of the regular 512GB Quest 3, which is eligible for the same bundle offer, and discontinued the 128GB Quest 3 (now on clearance for $430). Meta Quest 3 VR headset options: Check out the new Meta Quest 3S bundles below: The base model 128GB Meta Quest 3S costs $300, the same price as the now-discontinued Meta Quest 2. Not only are you getting a more advanced piece of tech for the same price, Meta is throwing in one of the most exciting upcoming Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusives, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The new Batman game releases October 22, one week after the Quest 3S arrives. The limited-time Meta Quest 3S bundle also comes with three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription program that normally costs $8 per month. With Quest+, you get two free games each month (valued up to $50). Even if you cancel your subscription, you get to keep those freebies. If you're new to the Meta Quest ecosystem, you're essentially getting seven free games with the purchase of the Quest 3S. Since the Quest 3S launches in October, you'll get two free games each month through the end of the year. Amazon also has a bundle that includes the Elite Strap, one of the most popular first-party accessories for Meta Quest headsets. The Elite Strap replaces the default band and is designed to provide better weight distribution to minimize pressure on your face. The strap is fitted with a dial that allows you to make quick adjustments. You can preorder the Meta Quest 3S bundle with the Elite Strap for $365.73 at Amazon. If Amazon drops the price bundle prior to launch, you'll pay the lowest price offered when your preorder is shipped. If you're unsure about the Elite Strap, you can buy it separately later on. At the moment, buying the headset and Elite Strap separately costs the same price as the bundle at Amazon. The 256GB Meta Quest 3S is available to preorder for $400 at Amazon. Like the 128GB version, you'll get Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta+. Amazon has the Quest 3S 256GB bundle with the Elite Strap included for $465.73. If you want to play Batman: Arkham Shadow but would rather opt for the more powerful Meta Quest 3, the same bundle is available to purchase now at Amazon. The Meta Quest 3 Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle costs $500, which sounds like quite the deal considering the price of the 512GB Quest 3 up until now. Meta revealed the bundle alongside a price drop for the Quest 3. The 512GB model previously cost $650 and will now go for $500. The 128GB model is being discontinued, but remaining stock will be sold for $430 (was $500). As a result of its discontinuation, the 128GB Quest 3 will not be available in the new Batman bundle, but you can buy the headset now for $429 at Walmart.

Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Here is what you need to know about Orion, the new computer-on-your-face nerd glasses Mark Zuckerberg showed off today: Each pair of glasses reportedly costs Meta $10,000 to make, and the company says it needs time to get them to a price that makes them plausible — think something in the $1,000-ish range, like a laptop or high-end phone. (That $10,000 number comes from The Verge's Alex Heath. Meta declined to comment on the number). If all goes well, it could take a few years for that to happen. 2. I've tried them, and they are very cool! They don't make you look cool — you look like someone wearing tech on your face — but the ideas and engineering behind them are really fascinating. If you're one of the people who complains that Silicon Valley hasn't made anything except soul-sucking social networks and monetization machines for years, here's a compelling counter. More important: Unlike other face-computing tech I've tried over the years — Google's Glass, Apple's Vision Pro, Meta's own line of Quest goggles — this is one I can actually imagine buying, and using, in real life. My brief experience with Orion comes with major caveats. The biggest is that it's not actually ready for mass production. But if this pans out, it will deliver what lots of people in tech, and outside tech, say they want: a wearable computer jammed into a pair of glasses. What would you do with a wearable computer? For starters, lots of things you can do with a phone: Take and make phone calls and video calls. Send and receive texts. Take photos and videos. Watch videos. Play time-wasting games. Play around with AI. And because Orion sits on your face like glasses — bulky glasses that use silicon carbide instead of glass — you can do all those things while looking at, and interacting with, everything and everyone around you. This is "augmented reality" — digital images laid over the real world. As opposed to "virtual reality" — where you are totally enveloped by a digital landscape. There are obvious downsides to this. If you think it's frustrating to talk to someone who keeps looking at their phone to check a text or a viral video, imagine what it will be like to hold a conversation with someone who's staring at you and staring at something else at the very same time.* But there are very intriguing upsides, too. Most obviously: Picture yourself with a task — like changing a tire, making marinara, or solving a math problem — and the ability to simultaneously look at the thing you want to do and instructions on how to do it. Orion uses eye tracking, which means you select digital items just by looking at them. And you manipulate them — turn an app on or off, respond to a text message, swipe through videos on Reels — by making subtle flicks and clicks with your fingers. Those gestures get registered by a snug-but-not-bulky wristband** that registers your muscles' movements using electromyography*** and transmits them wirelessly to your glasses. Orion also comes the closest I've seen to a face computer you could take for a stroll. Unlike other devices I've seen, it doesn't need to be plugged into a bulky power source or tethered to a phone. Instead, it connects wirelessly to a TV-remote-sized power/computing device you can slip into your pocket that connects to the internet via WiFi or cell signals. Meta says its battery will last for two to three hours of continual use. And here, I'm going to stop talking about Orion's specs. Because it seems pretty silly to get very deep into a thing that's still in development and may never actually materialize for mass production. It's also important to stress that my brief demo time was in a Meta building, surrounded by Meta employees who guided me through a Meta-scripted walk-through. I have no idea how, or if, this thing works in the real world. Neither do Meta executives, really. They say they're about to start "dogfooding" the device with lots of employees to get a better sense of how it performs while continuing to figure out how to make it lighter and cheaper. Which brings us to two questions about Zuckerberg's reveal this week. First: Why is Meta showing off something no one's going to be able to buy — at best — for years? This reminds me of pre-iPhone reveals, where it was common for tech companies to show you stuff they might make one day, but very often didn't. When I ask Meta executives that question, they murmur about wanting their fellow employees to see the work they're doing, and to be encouraged by the progress they're making. But surely there are other ways to pump up morale — like having a record-high stock price, which happens to have happened this week. My theory relates to that stock price: that Zuckerberg, who has gotten grief over the years for plowing billions into his metaverse dreams, wants to show the world — and specifically investors — that all those dollars weren't wasted. And that he's getting very close to a consumer device people might buy in very large numbers. Which brings us to my second question: Why does Meta, whose online ad business is one of the world's greatest money-printing machines, want to make hardware anyway? That one is easier to answer. Most practically: As great as that money-printing machine is, it can't work without phones made by Apple and Google — companies that force Meta to play by their rules and restrictions. If Orion, or any other device Meta makes, becomes the future of computing, then Zuckerberg can operate his business on his devices. But if you're into vibes-based answers: Orion's debut is part of the Mark Zuckerberg 3.0 era. One where he says he's done apologizing (even though he's still apologizing) and done with politics (even though politics is not done with him). One where he's trying new looks (including his own designs). So if he wants to take a victory lap with very cool new tech — even if the tech isn't quite ready for prime time? He's going to do that, too. *The entire time I played with Orion, I kept thinking about teenagers I see walking around with a single AirPod in their ear at all times. The idea, supposedly, is that they can keep listening to whatever they want while begrudgingly listening to you, too. I find that half-in, half-out way of interacting with the world incredibly frustrating. But I'm old. Your mileage may vary. **For whatever reason, some Meta people call this a "neural wristband," which makes it seem like it's somehow reading your brain. Thankfully, it is not. ***(I had never heard of this term before this week, either.) Jump to

Title: Meta Will Discontinue Quest 2 & Quest Pro By The End Of The Year

Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Meta made the announcement today at Meta Connect 2024. It comes as the company officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, starting at $300, and announced that it's also discontinuing the 128GB Quest 3 after cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 model to $500. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: Quest 2 launched in 2020 with a remarkable proposition: a twice as powerful chipset and higher resolution than the original Oculus Quest at a $100 lower price. Sure it also lost the OLED and precise lens separation adjustment of its predecessor, but this didn't seem to matter much as the improved graphics and $300 price point propelled Quest 2 to a level of success no other VR headset has reached before or since. Quest 2 outsold all its predecessors combined within 6 months of being on sale. Meta has now shipped an estimated 20-30 million Quest 2 units through its four years on the market, similar to the number of Xbox Series X/S consoles sold so far. The first major standalone VR games to not support Quest 2 are launching soon, but many other VR apps will likely support Quest 2 for many years to come, and Quest 2's lenses and display will live on in Quest 3S. Building on the success of Quest 2, two years later Meta hoped it could introduce a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a battery in the rear of the strap, and ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was lacking. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful chipset at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of automatic room sensing for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And earlier this year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. When Quest Pro is off the market, Meta will no longer be selling any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time next year. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Meta Just Cut The 512GB Quest 3 To $500 And Will Discontinue The 128GB Model

Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:25:00Z

The 128GB storage model of Quest 3 is being discontinued, and the 512GB model has been cut to its $500 price. Quest 3 launched a year ago with two models, 128GB storage for $500 or 512GB for $650. When stock of the 128GB model depletes, the 512GB option will be the sole Quest 3 model. Until that happens, the 128GB model is available at a discounted price of $430. This announcement comes as Meta just officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, a cheaper headset that has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and single panel from Quest 2. Meta also announced that it's discontinuing Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year or when stock runs out, whichever comes first. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: As well as simplifying Meta's lineup, this move could push many potential Quest 3S 256GB buyers up to Quest 3, since for $100 more they can get a slimmer headset with double the storage, pancake lenses, higher resolution, and precise IPD adjustment.

Title: Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: More similar than you'd expect
URL: https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3
Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:21:25Z

No offers found You'll be shocked how alike the Meta Quest 3S is to the costlier Quest 3, though some budget-friendly Quest 2 traits return. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Affordable upgrade Meta has made VR more accessible to consumers again by bringing next-gen gaming and mixed reality apps to the same price point that made the Quest 2 so popular. Its lenses and display are unchanged from the previous generation, but it's more powerful and versatile than ever. Full upgrade The Meta Quest 3 has the same game library and graphical power as the Quest 3S but makes those games more visually appealing with more pixels and a wider view. Plus you get all the storage space you could want. Whether that's enough to pay the extra $200 is up to you. The Meta Quest 3S is here as a low-priced alternative to the Quest 3. If you compare the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 closely, you'll note a ton of similarities. Although it looks like a Quest 2 with new cameras, it shares more in common with the newer headset, from performance to accessories. If you're a Quest 2 owner, you might have been put off by the Quest 3's higher price and held off on upgrading. Now, the Quest 3S has the same price and many of the same upgrades; however, Meta has also discounted the Quest 3 512GB from $649 to $499 — the original price for the 128GB Quest 3 — and now's a good time to choose the mainline headset, too. Based on our year testing out the Quest 3 and our Quest 3S hands-on demo at Connect, we'll break down every main similarity and difference between the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3! The Meta Quest 3S is essentially a hybrid between the Quest 2 visuals and Quest 3 hardware. Before breaking down the specific downgrades, we'll explain every way that the Quest 3S will modernize things for Quest 2 users. New CPU & extra RAM: Both the Quest 3 and 3S share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Meta says this combination delivers twice-as-fast GPU performance for faster loading times. Even though the Quest 2 and 3 share most of the same games, the Quest 3 version will often have an exclusive patch with graphical enhancements like higher refresh rates, reduced fog, better lighting and shadows, more enemies or environmental objects on screen at once, better colors, and improved textures. Quest 3 exclusives: Most developers try to target both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, but some upcoming AAA games will be Quest 3 exclusives because they're too graphically demanding for the Quest 2's headset. So far, we know of Batman: Arkham Shadow, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and the recently-released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded. Aside from those, many other upcoming Quest games are Quest 3-exclusive because they need full-color passthrough with high mixed-reality resolution to work well. Full-color passthrough: Despite the different camera configuration, the Meta Quest 3S has the same 4MP RGB camera with 18 pixels per degree (PPD) passthrough resolution, letting you see your living room in full color, if not at quite the same resolution as full virtual reality. Mixed-reality games were gimmicky and unpolished when the Quest 3 first launched, but these games have improved significantly in 2024; on the hardware end, Meta fixed mixed-reality warping and made MR apps use 80% less GPU processing in software updates over the summer. With the Quest 3S, you're getting a better MR experience right from the start. Controllers: The Meta Quest 3S uses Touch Plus controllers, the same controller generation as the Quest 3. These controllers remove the bulky tracking ring, relying on LEDs around the controller body for inside-out tracking. They also add improved haptics. Weight: Even though the Meta Quest 3S is thicker than the Quest 3, it weighs 1g less (514 vs. 515g), making the fit experience pretty darn comparable. Accessories: We were surprised to learn that most of the best Quest 3 accessories should carry over to the Quest 3S. According to Meta, its first-party carrying case, Elite Strap, Elite Strap with Battery, Touch Plus Active Straps, Compact Charging Dock, and Link cable will work with the Quest 3S, too. We assume that our favorite third-party Elite Straps will work as well; we'll test this as soon as we have our Quest 3S review unit. The obvious aesthetic difference with the front cameras aside, both the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 look very similar to one another, with the white plastic frame, sensors along the edge, and Meta label in front. One small design difference is that Meta removed the Quest 3's 3.5mm headphone jack from the left arm and moved its right-side USB-C charging port to the left. That gives you fewer headphone options than before; your best bet is wireless earbuds with a USB-C dongle that allows for charging passthrough, so you can still use a battery pack. The Meta Quest 3 was the first to use pancake lenses, with a flattened, reflective design that takes up less horizontal space but also requires more brightness. Most other VR headsets use thicker Fresnel lenses that make them front-heavy and have a noticeable "sweet spot" at the center. Our Quest 3 reviewer specifically praised the pancake lenses for eliminating that sweet spot for better visual clarity. One of the Quest 3S' cost cutbacks is using a Fresnel lens. Meta managed to make the Quest 3S 19.3mm thinner than the Quest 2, but it's still 11.6mm thicker than the Quest 3, shifting the weight forward. Just as many people upgraded the Quest 2 with an Elite Strap for better support and security during fast-paced VR games, you'll probably want the same for the Quest 3S. Visually, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S both use LCDs, but the Quest 3 (2,064 x 2,208) gives you 30% higher resolution than the Quest 3S (1,832 x 1,920, or the same as the Quest 2 display). That, combined with the Fresnel sweet spot, will make the visual experience familiar to Quest 2 owners and detract a bit from the next-gen graphics. Also, the Meta Quest 3S shares the Quest 2's shorter and narrower field of view (FoV) compared to the Quest 3. Unfortunately, the Meta Quest 3S brought back the Quest 2's interpupillary distance (IPD) system to save money. You can slide the lenses to three preset distances — 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm — instead of the IPD wheel and 1mm gaps from 53mm to 75mm you get on the Quest 3. During our hands-on, we found you could slide the Quest 3S lenses in-between those three IPD presets (about 60mm or 65mm), in case your personal IPD doesn't match one of those three presets; it's just trickier and less exact than on the Quest 3. Because the Quest 3S made these lens and design changes, Quest 3 facial interfaces won't work with the Quest 3S; Meta will sell a unique "Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface" if you want a comfort upgrade for VR workouts. Meta started out selling the Quest 3 in 128GB and 512GB versions, but it's phasing out the 128GB model and making 512GB the default. The Quest 3S will ship in 128GB and 256GB sizes, matching the Quest 2 before it went out of stock. Most casual VR gamers will happily make do with 128GB of space; your average VR game takes up 5GB or less, though some of the major titles are 10GB or more. Both headsets use camera sensors to track your controllers or hands and map your surroundings so you don't hurt yourself, as well as a 4MP RGB camera for full-color passthrough. The only camera difference is that Meta gave the Quest 3 a physical depth sensor to determine how close or far away things are, while the Quest 3S uses software to detect it (as the Quest 2 did). Both the Quest 3 and 3S burn through battery quickly because of the Snapdragon XR2 and 8GB of RAM. But even though the Quest 3S (4,324mAh capacity) has a smaller battery than the Quest 3 (5,060 mAh), Meta estimates that the Quest 3S lasts about 18 minutes longer per charge (2.5 hours versus 2.2 hours). We assume that the Quest 3's higher resolution and brighter pancake lenses require more power, making the Quest 3S more efficient. We've asked Meta for confirmation on this. If you own the Quest 2 and want a new VR headset, then you're probably already happy with the level of immersion the Quest 3S will offer with the same resolution and lens. The Quest 3 resolution and storage boost would certainly be nice to have, but maybe not nice enough to justify spending another $200. Because it has the same CPU and memory, the Quest 3S will handle all the same VR and MR games equally well, receive support for the same amount of time, and do slightly better for battery life. It may feel more front-heavy, but an Elite Strap will fix that; frankly, we think the Quest 3 needs an Elite Strap for long-term comfort too, so you'll have to spend the extra money either way. Even though we'll still rank the Meta Quest 3 as the best VR headset today, the Quest 3S will be good enough for everyone who skipped the pricier headset. Affordable upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3S if you want the power, game library, and mixed-reality passthrough of the Quest 3 for a lower price. Don't choose it if you dislike the Quest 2's visual experience and want something truly next-gen. Full upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3 for the most storage, a pixel-packed display, wider field of view, and better hand tracking via the depth sensor. Skip it if you're on a budget and can make do without every possible feature.

Title: Meta has officially discontinued three of its VR headsets, including my current favorite

Goodbye Quest 2, Quest Pro, and 128GB Quest 3 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched the Meta Quest 3S (you can check out our hands on Meta Quest 3S review for our thoughts on it) and introduced us to a new affordable member of the Quest family, and also killed off three others. It’s time to officially say goodbye to the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3. The Meta Quest 2 has been sold out everywhere since July, so this announcement isn’t a surprise – it already happened. It’s sad, but with the 3S here, there’s no reason to pick up a Quest 2, frankly. It was fantastic, and I loved it, but it’s time for the next generation of XR hardware. The Meta Quest Pro has been hanging on, but its demise shouldn’t be a shocker. It’s never a good sign when a product drops one-third of its price in just six months on sale, and since the Quest 3 launch – a way cheaper headset that even performs better in a few key areas – the Quest Pro has very much faded into the background. Meta says these devices will still be on sale until the end of the year or until its remaining stock runs dry – whichever comes first. So if you want one for your collection, act fast, but if I were you, I’d pay attention to a different Quest that’s being killed off. My favorite of the trio: the Meta Quest 3 128GB. As leakers reported the day before Meta Connect, the Quest 3 128GB model is also being discontinued. The 512GB Meta Quest 3 will remain on sale, however, at a reduced price of $499.99 / £469.99 / AU$1,049.99. From now until the stock runs out, the 128GB Meta Quest 3 will be on sale for $429.99 / £409.99 / AU$799.99, and it looks like this could be the best headset to buy right now as it has all the upgrades of the full-Quest 3 while still being fairly affordable. Plus, given that VR games and apps aren’t big files 128GB is more than enough – especially as it’s so easy to delete and later redownload titles if you run out of storage. The only downside of this deal is you’ll miss out on the Batman: Arkham Shadow purchase bonus included with the Meta Quest 3S models and 512GB Meta Quest 3. This is a slight incentive to opt for the 512GB model instead, but even if you buy it separately the Meta Quest 3 128GB model is still a solid deal. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Just make sure you make a decision quickly, as it’s not clear how quickly Meta and third-party retailers will run out of stock.

Title: Meta discontinues Quest 2 and Quest Pro | TechCrunch

Comment Hidden among the Meta Connect 2024 hardware announcements comes word that the social media giant is sunsetting two key members of its Quest VR headset line. With the budget Quest 3S now up for preorder, Meta will no longer sell the Quest 2 and Quest Pro once back stock is deleted. The end of the Quest 2 isn’t surprising. The headset is long in the tooth, celebrating its fourth birthday in October. Meta kept the legacy device on sale as a way to offer a cheaper alternative to the Quest 3. The new Quest 3S, however, now occupies its place in the lineup with its $300 starting price. It also shares some key characteristics with the new 3S model, including display resolution. The Quest Pro, on the other hand, debuted in 2022 as Meta’s bid to offer up its mixed reality for enterprise. The truth is, however, that last year’s Quest 3 made the Pro model largely redundant, and did so at a lower price point. Here’s what Meta has to say on the matter: “[Y]ou know what they say about new beginnings. With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first. If you’d like a carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers, the Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, we plan to continue selling those for a bit longer.” Notably, Meta is also ending security patch updates for the original Quest headset in September. Presumably such support for the Quest 2 and Quest Pro 2 will last a while longer. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Say goodbye to the 128GB version of Quest 3, as the company is slated to only offer the 512GB version moving forward, and at a new, more attractive price. With the entrance of Quest 3S, and the discontinuation of Quest 2 and Quest Pro, Meta’s lineup is shifting a bit to make way for its new entry level XR headset, Quest 3S. Released in late 2023 for $650, the 512GB version of Quest 3 is still the company’s best-in-class headset. But now Quest 3 (512GB) is is dropping to just $500. Meanwhile, Quest 3 (128GB), which was originally $500, is being phased out. Meta is pricing Quest 3 (128GB) at $430 until supply is gone. Although the Quest 3 (128GB) price cut isn’t massive, it’s certainly not something to sneeze at if you absolutely need a great XR headset today and don’t want to go down a half-step with Quest 3S, which is being offered starting at $300 for the 128GB version and $400 for the 256GB version. Quest 3S is slated to launch on October 15th, offering the same resolution and Fresnel optics as Quest 2, but with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR gen 2 chipset as of Quest 3.

Title: Quest 2 and Quest Pro are Being Discontinued, Encouraging Wider Adoption of Mixed Reality

Out with the old, in with the new. Meta announced that the cheap and cheerful Quest 2 and the company’s pricey mixed reality pioneer Quest Pro are officially getting the boot, marking Meta’s next big push to bring mixed reality to the masses. There aren’t any official figures going around, but it’s safe to say Quest 2 was Meta’s most popular VR headset to date, coming just one year after the launch of the original Quest, which was released in May 2019. Still, even nearly three years after release, Quest 2 was so popular last Holiday season it handily outsold Quest 3 on Amazon. While it’s impossible to say whether Quest 3S will live up to Quest 2’s legacy, at an aggressive $300 price point for the entry-level 128GB model, it has a pretty good chance of again attracting plenty of eyeballs when it launches October 15th. So much can’t be said for Quest Pro, which always felt more like an expensive mixed reality dev kit than a consumer device, launching in 2022 for an eye-watering $1,500. Granted, Meta relented somewhat, bringing it down to $1,000 nearly a year after launch, likely owing to its overly exclusionary price point and lack of compelling MR content—something Meta hopes to deliver on starting with Quest 3S. That said, we’re unlikely to recommend Quest Pro over Quest 3 or Quest 3S due to the upcoming slate of Quest 3-exclusive content that notably doesn’t support Quest Pro. And with that, Meta is now officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Quest Pro. Remaining stock will be sold through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first, Meta says. Accessories for both are still going to be on offer, such as carrying cases, Touch Pro controllers, Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, with Meta noting it will to continue selling those “for a bit longer” after Quest 2 and QUest Pro headset supplies dry up. So, out with the old, in the with the new. Check out our hands-on with Quest 3S to get the full details on just why Meta thinks you might want its next XR headset.

Title: Ozempic is bridging the political divide

The health benefits of blockbuster weight loss drugs are bridging the stark political divide in the United States. Progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said on Tuesday, in a Senate committee hearing on high anti-obesity drug prices, that he agreed with Elon Musk, a supporter of Former President Donald Trump, when it comes to expanding access to GLP-1 weight loss drugs. These treatments, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. The most popular GLP-1 drugs on the market are Ozempic (NVO) and Wegovy, both of which are produced by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk. “Solving obesity greatly reduces risk of other diseases, especially diabetes, and improves quality of life. We do need to find a way to make appetite inhibitors available to anyone who wants them,” Musk posted last week on X (TSLA), the social media platform he owns. The post was made in response to a post about Sen. Sanders claiming that generic drug companies have said they can sell cheaper versions of these medications for less than $100 a month. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52 for a month’s supply. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02. The cost of these popular medications is already much cheaper in other countries. For example, Ozempic is just $59 in Germany and Wegovy is only $92 in the U.K. “I don’t agree with Bernie about many things, but I do on this,” Musk wrote. Sen. Sanders grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen Tuesday morning during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs in the U.S. Sen. Sanders said that Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at Tuesday’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. At one point, Sen. Sanders quoted Musk’s tweet and said that “Mr. Musk is right.” Later that day, Musk posted on X that he really is “with Bernie on this one.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Ever since shares of Nvidia (NVDA) reached an all-time high in June, the chipmaker’s stock has experienced some turbulence — but its market cap is still up over 150% so far this year. Nvidia’s shares were up 2.37% during mid-day trading Monday at $123.73 per share — down around 9% from its record-high close price of $135.58 on June 18, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156.86% so far this year, boosting its market cap just above $3 trillion and making it the third-most valuable company in the world. Compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. The company has been one of the biggest winners of the generative artificial intelligence boom due to high demand for its Hopper graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are used for training and inferencing of some of the world’s most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, samples of Nvidia’s latest AI platform, Blackwell, are shipping to customers, and the product is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. In August, reports that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws sent Nvidia’s shares down. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back into third place, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. However, despite reporting another record quarter that beat Wall Street’s expectations, Nvidia’s shares slipped in August, reflecting unimpressed investors who want more from the chipmaker.

Title: The Biggest Supreme Court Cases to Watch This Term
URL: https://time.com/7024317/supreme-court-term-cases-2024/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T15:42:28Z
Full Content:
The U.S. Supreme Court returns to the bench on Oct. 7 to start a new term that includes cases on transgender rights, guns, pornography, flavored vapes, and more. In the coming months, the court will hear a case that will examine the constitutionality of state bans on medical treatments for transgender minors. It will hear two others that could radically reshape regulations on ghost guns and redefine corporate accountability in the tech industry. And it may confront urgent election-related litigation after Nov. 5 that tests the limits of the Electoral Count Act, depending on the aftermath of the presidential election. The new term begins as the Supreme Court is grappling with significant internal challenges and public scrutiny, as concerns about undisclosed gifts to certain Justices and ideologically divided decisions on some of the nation’s most divisive issues has raised questions about transparency and impartiality within the institution. A July 2024 survey from the Pew Research Center found that 47% of Americans express a favorable opinion of the court following a consequential term, in which it granted presidents broad criminal immunity for some actions in office, preserved access to an abortion pill, and upheld a law that prevents those under a restraining order for domestic violence from possessing guns. Here are some of the key cases coming up this term. Perhaps the highest-profile case already on the docket, United States v. Skrmetti could have significant implications for transgender rights across the country. The case focuses on a Tennessee law that prohibits certain medical treatments for transgender minors, including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and gender-transition surgeries. The case marks the first time the Justices will weigh in on the constitutionality of statewide bans of this nature, which have proliferated in approximately two dozen Republican-led states in recent years. The Tennessee law, known as SB1, has already stirred considerable controversy, with the Biden Administration and various advocacy groups arguing that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has contended that the law discriminates against transgender individuals by allowing these medical interventions for other medical conditions while categorically banning them for gender dysphoria. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti defends the law as a necessary measure to protect minors from potentially irreversible treatments that may be based on "uncertain" benefits. The Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case comes at a time of increasing legal fragmentation regarding transgender healthcare, with different federal courts issuing conflicting rulings. Legal analysts suggest that the Supreme Court’s ruling could establish a landmark precedent not only on transgender medical care but also on broader issues of civil rights, including access to public facilities and participation in sports. In Garland v. VanDerStok, the Justices will hear a case that challenges the Biden Administration’s regulation of ghost guns—untraceable firearms that can be assembled from kits and lack serial numbers. The case represents a critical moment in the ongoing debate over gun control, as the regulation was designed to combat the increasing prevalence of these weapons in crime scenes across the country. The rule, implemented in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), expands the definition of a firearm under the Gun Control Act of 1968. It mandates that unfinished parts, such as gun frames and receivers, must be serialized and licensed, ensuring that they can be traced. The regulation also requires background checks for the sale of these components. However, it has faced pushback from gun owners and manufacturers, who argue that it overreaches the authority granted to the ATF and violates the original intent of federal firearm laws. A federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision to strike down the regulation. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor contended that the definition of a firearm does not encompass kits and parts, arguing that such interpretations should be the purview of Congress, not the judiciary. The ruling raised alarms among some law enforcement and advocacy groups, which fear that a Supreme Court decision against the regulation could lead to an influx of ghost guns, complicating efforts to address gun violence. The Supreme Court is set to determine the legality of a Texas law mandating age verification for users of pornographic websites. The case, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, could have significant implications for First Amendment rights, as the state law, enacted in June 2023, aims to restrict minors from accessing sexually explicit content by requiring users to provide personal information for age verification. Proponents of the law, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, argue that it is necessary to protect minors from exposure to harmful material. They assert that requiring age verification ensures that only adults can access pornography, thus addressing a pressing public safety concern. However, critics, including the Free Speech Coalition, contend that the law infringes upon the constitutional rights of adults, creating a chilling effect on access to protected speech. They argue that the measure is overbroad and fails to account for the privacy risks associated with submitting personal information online. Read More: How an Ordained Rabbi Ended Up Owning the World’s Most Famous Porn Company A federal district judge initially blocked the law, citing concerns that it imposes unnecessary restrictions on adult access to constitutionally protected material. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later permitted the law to take effect, ruling that the age verification requirement is rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in preventing minors from accessing pornography. However, dissenting opinions within the panel highlighted the law's potential to limit access to protected speech for adults, raising questions about its constitutionality. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments, a case that will evaluate the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to deny marketing authorization for flavored e-cigarettes produced by Triton Distribution. The case comes amid ongoing concerns about the popularity of vaping among young people and the agency's efforts to regulate products that might appeal to minors. At the heart of the dispute is the FDA's rejection of applications for sweet-flavored e-liquids, including varieties such as "Jimmy The Juice Man Peachy Strawberry" and "Killer Kustard Blueberry." The agency contends that these products pose a "serious, well-documented risk" of enticing young users, contributing to alarming rates of e-cigarette use among adolescents. In 2020, nearly 20% of high school students reported using e-cigarettes, with flavored options being the overwhelming choice, the FDA said in court documents. They have argued that companies failed to demonstrate that the benefits of their products for adult smokers outweighed the risks of underage consumption. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously sided with Triton, declaring that the FDA had acted in an "arbitrary and capricious" manner by imposing new requirements for studies on smoking cessation that had not been communicated prior to the companies’ applications. The implications of the case could extend beyond flavored e-cigarettes. The court's decision may clarify the FDA's authority under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which mandates that new tobacco products be proven “appropriate for the protection of the public health.” The Justices will hear Meta’s appeal in a high-stakes class action lawsuit related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has drawn significant scrutiny over the misuse of user data. The high court will review a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed the lawsuit, spearheaded by Amalgamated Bank on behalf of shareholders, to proceed. Investors allege that Meta misled them about the risks associated with Facebook user data being improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The lawsuit claims that inadequate disclosures led to substantial drops in Meta’s stock price in 2018, following revelations that the personal information of approximately 87 million Facebook users had been exploited without consent. The litigation, initiated in 2018, accuses Meta and its executives of violating the Securities Exchange Act by making false statements regarding data security risks that had already materialized. In its defense, Meta argues that the 9th Circuit's ruling sets a troubling precedent that could require public companies to disclose historical incidents that do not pose current risks. Meta has already faced penalties, including a $5 billion fine and a $725 million settlement related to user privacy violations. In NVIDIA v. E. Ohman J, the Supreme Court will consider a case that challenges the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of fraudulent intent in shareholder class action lawsuits. The core of the dispute revolves around allegations that Nvidia misrepresented its dependence on the volatile cryptocurrency mining market, leading to significant financial losses for investors. Shareholders claim that the company’s CEO made misleading statements about demand for its products, failing to disclose crucial information that could indicate a risk of mismanagement. At the heart of the case is the legal standard for establishing "scienter," or the intent to deceive, which requires plaintiffs to present specific facts demonstrating that a defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard. Nvidia, whose computer chips the world relies on to make AI systems, argues that the Ninth Circuit improperly accepted vague allegations from unnamed former employees and speculative analyses from hired experts, rather than concrete evidence of fraudulent intent. The company contends that such reliance on speculation undermines the stringent requirements set forth in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. A ruling in favor of Nvidia could reinforce higher standards for investor claims and potentially reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits, while a decision that supports the Ninth Circuit's stance might embolden shareholders to pursue more claims based on less concrete evidence, experts say.

Embedded AI/ML Capabilities to Improve Performance and Reliability, Create Economies of Scale and Chart a Path to 25Gbps Future Over Existing Network Infrastructure PALO ALTO, Calif. and STAMFORD, Conn. and PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Broadcom Inc., Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), and Comcast today announced a joint development of Unified DOCSIS chipsets for network nodes, smart amps, and cable modems, enabling both FDX and ESD versions of the DOCSIS 4.0 specification, and setting the stage to deliver upwards of 25 Gbps speeds over existing networks. This specification brings together all the benefits of both DOCSIS ESD and DOCSIS FDX and includes support for both mid-split and high-split configurations. Designed for compliance with the existing DOCSIS 4.0 standard and creating a foundation for the next generation, the technology solutions will enable all operators through a single and open standard, delivering on the following advantages: "By pushing the benefits of AI and ML to the edge of our network, we are maximizing network performance, improving the internet experience, and introducing new and exciting services to support our customers' incredible appetite for more, higher quality data," said Charlie Herrin, President, Technology, Product, Experience, Comcast. "Supporting a single technology that can be used by all operators efficiently, over their existing networks, allows the industry to leverage its collective investment, and to increase the benefits of AI at the edge." This collaboration also will dramatically enhance DOCSIS networks with advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, utilizing Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)'s embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in the network nodes, smart amps, and modems. Operators will be able to increase operational efficiency and improve network security and reliability through specific advancements, including: "Charter, Comcast, and Broadcom are collaboratively driving industry innovation through the Unified DOCSIS 4.0 specification," said Rich DiGeronimo, President of Product and Technology, Charter Communications, which operates the Spectrum brand. "By integrating Broadcom's cutting-edge technology into our network infrastructure and cable modems, our network will leverage artificial intelligence to enhance power, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, ultimately delivering superior services to our customers." Setting the Stage for the Next Generation This three-way collaboration also augments each company's investment in the future of DOCSIS through an agreement to start developing a path to 25 Gbps. Among the enhancements of this evolution will be the extension of DOCSIS to higher spectrum. By expanding the supported bandwidth on hybrid fiber coax (HFC) networks up to 3 GHz, this pioneering technology delivers many benefits to cable operators' existing networks without requiring them to build new infrastructure. While this initiative is in the early planning stages, it would ultimately allow for increased network speeds for continued competitive service offerings and the ability to apply operator software into next generation advanced products.

Title: A weight loss drug maker is aiming for a big IPO
URL: https://qz.com/bioage-labs-ipo-weight-loss-1851657152
Time Published: 2024-09-25T15:27:36Z
Full Content:
BioAge Labs, a biopharmaceutical startup focused on obesity drugs, is looking to raise nearly $200 million in its recently expanded, planned initial public offering, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Richmond, California-based company said on Wednesday that it plans to offer 10.5 million shares between $17 and $19 each. BioAge previously planned to only offer 7.5 million shares at the same price range. The updated SEC filing comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly’s has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors’ bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In its filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their “high prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health” and “outsized commercial opportunities.” BioAge’s leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge’s upcoming IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. BioAge isn’t the only company working to disrupt the weight loss drug duopoly dominated by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Surging demand for weight loss medications has transformed the two pharmaceutical developers into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Now several drug makers are racing to develop their own weight loss competitors. Viking Therapeutics is developing both a weight loss injection and a pill while large pharma companies like Roche and Pfizer are also working on their own anti-obesity drugs.

Title: Why moves by Amazon and comments by Jamie Dimon don’t threaten an end to remote work benefits | CNN Business

Time Published: 2024-09-25T14:18:18Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: If your employer lets you work remotely one or more days a week, and you highly value that kind of flexibility, you probably didn’t love hearing last week that Amazon will soon require its corporate employees to return to the office five days a week. Or that Dell in a memo asked its global sales team employees who are able to work from a company office to do so five days a week, up from three previously, and noting that “working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine.” Or when AT&T last year announced it was consolidating offices and requiring managers to work on site at least three days a week — which meant some managers who lived near an office that was closing had to relocate or quit. Or even when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, most of whose employees are already working in the office five days, publicly expressed displeasure last week that more government employees weren’t working on site in federal buildings, which he described as “empty,” according to various news reports. Whenever big players publicly change direction and require employees to be in the office full time, the worry is that other employers will follow suit. But for two key reasons, these kinds of public proclamations don’t signal a broader demise of remote work benefits. In the case of Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy’s memo announcing his new RTO mandate said all the usual things about wanting to strengthen in-person collaboration and company culture. But, importantly, Jassy also highlighted his desire to reduce the glut of managers hired in recent years, which had created more “layers,” including “a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward,” he said. To thin the managerial herd, Jassy called on senior leaders in the company “to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.” Related article How can you prevent being laid off? You can’t. Here’s why Normally, that might involve manager layoffs. But Amazon said Wednesday that assertion is inaccurate. The effort to increase the ratio of individuals to managers is “not the same as eliminating roles and would not necessarily involve layoffs,” the company told CNN, noting that it has “no plans to reduce overall headcount as part of this decision.” But by imposing an unpopular mandate to be in the office five days a week, “middle managers who have been made wealthy enough will say ‘I’m leaving,’” said Chris Williams, a former vice president of human resources at Microsoft who is now a leadership consultant to C-suite executives. That saves a company the expense of having to provide severance packages, because people will leave voluntarily. Jassy’s risk is that too many managers could quit. “He will solve his near-term problem. But he will have a hard time convincing new hires to commute to downtown Seattle five days a week. So he may have a going-forward recruiting problem,” Williams said. If so, that may require Amazon to eventually — and quietly — back off enforcing the new five-days-a-week mandate to attract talent, he suggested. While an individual company may decide to backtrack on its remote work policies, the numbers suggest that’s not happening widely. Workplace consulting firm Gallup found in May that among full-time employees in remote-capable jobs, 53% work a hybrid schedule, 27% work exclusively remotely and 21% work on site. Those are roughly the same percentages reported in November 2022. As of August 31, job postings on Indeed.com that specify hybrid and remote work have dipped a half percentage point year over year. But that’s primarily because industries that typically have the most remote-capable jobs (e.g., software development) have been hiring less of late, according to Nick Bunker, Indeed’s North American economic research director. Related article Deciding what to do when your employer changes the rules on remote work A Conference Board survey of US workers, meanwhile, found that workplace flexibility is the most important element of total compensation beyond a competitive salary. It also found that HR leaders say hybrid work models help attract and retain talent. So it’s not surprising that Gallup also found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term.” Many CEOs seem to have gotten the memo. The Conference Board in January reported that just 4% of US CEOs said they planned to prioritize bringing people back to the office full time. Williams noted: “I have yet to talk to any enlightened CEO who honestly believes the only way to make a good [workplace] culture is face-to-face.” Reuters contributed reporting to this article.

Title: On the Heels of Inflation, Why Experts Expect Gold Prices Will Climb to Record Highs in 2025

September 25, 2024 10:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Gold prices are forecast to climb to record highs in the coming year. The price of gold has soared to new heights this year and is positioned to climb into early 2025, rising to new record highs, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The precious metal has increased more than 20% this year, peaking at a record of more than $2,500 per troy ounce. Goldman Sachs Research forecasts the price will reach $2,700 by early next year, buoyed by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and gold purchases by emerging market central banks. The metal could get an additional boost if the US imposes new financial sanctions or if concerns mount about the US debt burden. They see that Gold prices are forecast to climb to record high. Goldman Sachs says that: “Gold is our strategists’ preferred near-term long (the commodity they most expect to go up in the short term), and it’s also their preferred hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. In this softer cyclical environment, gold stands out as the commodity where we have the highest confidence in near-term upside,” Goldman Sachs Research strategists Samantha Dart and Lina Thomas write. Active Mining Companies in the markets today include Asia Broadband Inc. (OTCPK: AABB), Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSE American: EQX), Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE: KGC), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD), IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG). In an additional article, Goldman Sachs added: “The yellow metal typically only guards against very high inflation and large inflation surprises caused by losses in central bank credibility and geopolitical supply shocks. Gold usually didn’t perform well in response to positive demand shocks when the central bank responded swiftly by hiking rates. Gold emerged as the best commodity to serve as a potential hedge against inflation and geo-political risks. Goldman Sachs Research’s base case is that gold appreciates to $2,700/troy ounce by year-end, an increase of about 16%, on solid demand from central banks in emerging markets and from Asian households. Gold could help shield against potential stock market drops if a trade war erupts, and it has upside if concerns mount about the US debt load or if the Fed is subordinated by a new administration.” Asia Broadband Inc. (OTCPK: AABB) Gold Production Continues Upward Trend For Third Quarter, As Ore Stockpile Processing Plant Advances Towards Completion - Asia Broadband Inc. (“AABB” or the “Company) is pleased to announce that the Company’s operations for the 3rd quarter ending September 30, 2024, will be completed next week and production levels have already surpassed the second quarter. The Company has exceeded its production and gross profit levels achieved in both the 1st and 2nd consecutive record quarters this year. Gold production more than doubled in the 1st quarter of 2024, in comparison to the 4th quarter of 2023, due to higher grade selection, recovery efficiencies and increased daily throughput levels. Additionally, the economies of scale from higher productions levels reduced production costs and added to the bottom-line gross profit, which has continued in an upward trend over the last three quarters. The elevated operational strategies and efficiencies of the AABB mining team continued in the 3rd quarter and has firmly established the foundation for the high production levels to follow the completion of the Company’s processing plant. The new facility is currently under construction in Etzatlan, Mexico, and its capacity will be primarily dedicated to processing the estimated $1 billion dollar ore value of the Company’s exclusive rights surface stockpile. AABB continues to develop the processing plant and will release updates as progress milestones are reached. The Company will release a processing plant project update in October. “The elevation of our production processes by the mining operations team in all three quarters of this year will have a multiplier effect with increased production levels. We are eagerly awaiting to extend this expertise to our massive ore stockpile processing when the new plant is complete. This will take us to a much higher level than we have ever reached before,” expressed Chris Torres, the Company President and CEO. AABB continues to implement its mining property acquisition strategy to optimize development capital utilization by focusing operations in regions of Mexico where AABB has a comparative advantage of development resources and expertise readily available for rapid expansion and duplication of the Company’s previous gold production success. CONTINUED… Read this full release for Asia Broadband at: https://www.financialnewsmedia.com/news-aabb/ Other recent developments in the mining industry include: Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD) recently said it is projecting a 30% growth in the production of gold-equivalent ounces from its existing assets by the end of this decade while it continues to unlock the value embedded in its portfolio, says president and chief executive Mark Bristow. Speaking at the Gold Forum Americas, Bristow said while Barrick was alert to potentially value-accretive opportunities generated by the consolidation of the industry, it had the rare luxury of doing so from an asset base that would support organic growth well into the future. “Five years ago, we set out to build a sustainably profitable gold and copper business focused on world-class assets. We did not have to buy them at a premium: they were embedded in the merged portfolio of Barrick and Randgold and we just had to unlock their value,” he said. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE: KGC) recently provided an update on the Great Bear project (the “Project”), located in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada. Kinross has completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Great Bear project which supports the Company’s acquisition thesis of a top tier high-margin operation in a stable jurisdiction with strong infrastructure. Based on mineral resources drilled to date, the PEA outlines a high-grade combined open pit and underground mine with an initial planned mine life of approximately 12 years and production cost of sales of $594 per ounce. The Project is expected to produce over 500,000 ounces per year at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of approximately $800 per ounce during the first 8 years through a conventional, modest capital 10,000 tonne per day (tpd) mill. Kinross has also released an updated mineral resource estimate increasing the inferred resource estimate by 568koz. to 3.884 Moz. which is in addition to the existing M&I resource estimate of 2.738 Moz. The mineral resource estimate and PEA for the Great Bear project are available here. Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSE American: EQX) recently announced an updated Mineral Resource Estimate ("MRE") for its 100% owned, exploration-stage Hasaga Property ("Hasaga" or the "Property") in Red Lake, Ontario. "Hasaga is located in the Red Lake Gold District of northwestern Ontario, which is renowned for its high gold grades and prolific historical gold production. This updated Mineral Resource Estimate focuses on the high-grade nature of the gold mineralization and is a departure from the previous bulk-tonnage approach," stated Scott Heffernan, EVP Exploration of Equinox Gold. "As expected, the updated Mineral Resource Estimate contains fewer gold ounces but at significantly higher average gold grades. "Further, the main zones of gold mineralization included in the updated Mineral Resource Estimate remain open, with numerous historical gold intersections defining drill-ready targets highlighting the potential for resource growth and new discoveries." IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG) recently announced that the Côté Gold Mine ("Côté Gold" or "Côté") has reached commercial production. Côté Gold is located in Ontario, Canada and is operated as a joint venture between IAMGOLD, as the operator, and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. ("Sumitomo"). Commercial production is defined as the achievement of reaching a minimum of 30 consecutive days of operations during which the mill operated at an average of 60% of nameplate throughput of 36,000 tpd. "I would like to commend our teams at Côté Gold who have come together to achieve another great milestone as we progress and ramp up what we believe will be one of Canada's largest gold mines and a model for modern mining in Canada," said Renaud Adams, President and Chief Executive Officer of IAMGOLD. "Since achieving the first pour of gold on March 31, 2024, our teams have spent the last four months methodically and iteratively testing and ramping up all facets of the mine. This process has required remarkable commitment, ingenuity and teamwork to bring all the systems online together to achieve this milestone."

Title: On human nanoscale synaptome: Morphology modeling and storage estimation
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310156
Time Published: 2024-09-25T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
One of the key challenges in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome which requires comprehensive knowledge of synaptome forming the neural microcircuits. The synaptic architecture determines limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders. Here, I address morphology modeling and storage estimation for the human synaptome at the nanoscale. A synapse is defined as a pair of pairs [(presynaptic_neuron),(presynaptic_axonal_terminal);(postsynaptic_neuron),(postsynaptic_dendritic_terminal)]. Center coordinates, radius, and identifier characterize a dendritic or axonal terminal. A synapse comprises topology with the paired neuron and terminal identifiers, location with terminal coordinates, and geometry with terminal radii. The storage required for the synaptome depends on the number of synapses and storage necessary for a single synapse determined by a synaptic model. I introduce three synaptic models: topologic with topology, point with topology and location, and geometric with topology, location, and geometry. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in the literature, four cases of neurons (30;86;100;138 billion) and three cases of synapses per neuron (1,000;10,000;30,000) are considered with three full and simplified (to reduce storage) synaptic models resulting in total 72 cases of storage estimation. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21(0.14) petabytes (PB) to 28.98(18.63) PB for the topologic model, from 0.57(0.32) PB to 78.66(43.47) PB for the point model, and from 0.69(0.38) PB to 95.22(51.75) PB for the geometric model. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the cortex needs from 86.80(55.80) TB to 2.60(1.67) PB for the topologic model, from 235.60(130.02) TB to 7.07(3.91) PB for the point model, and from 285.20(155.00) TB to 8.56(4.65) PB for the geometric model. The topologic model is sufficient to compute the connectome’s topology, but it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience. Frontier, the world’s most powerful supercomputer for 86 billion neurons can handle the nanoscale synaptome in the range of 1,000–10,000 synapses per neuron. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data work attempting to provide storage estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The human brain is an enormously complex, multi-scale, and multi-level structure operating in space and time as well as generating molecular, cellular, and neuronal phenomena [1]. Understanding its structure, function, and dysfunction is a huge scientific challenge, a critical social need, and a great market opportunity. While attempting to solve emerging problems, neuroscience progresses tremendously producing big data [2] whose processing requires high-performance computing [3]. The challenges emerge in the acquisition, processing, modeling, interpretation, storage, and use of neurodata; here we address modeling and storage. The knowledge of connectome is essential for understanding how neural microcircuits encode information and how the brain works in health and disease [4]. The full nanoscale connectomes have only been completed for nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) [5], larva Ciona intestinalis [6], and Drosophila [7]. These animals have very small brains; namely, Ciona intestinalis 177 neurons and about 6,600 connections, C.elegans 302 neurons (a constant number) and about 7,000 connections, and Drosophila about 100–130 thousand neurons and millions of connections. The human connectome has been developed at the macroscale by providing anatomical and functional connectivity [8]. The full human nanoscale connectome, however, has not yet been created. The most critical obstacles in obtaining it are the prohibitively long overall time necessary to acquire data and the computing resources required for storing and processing these big data [2,3,9]. For instance, to image the whole human brain would require an estimated 17 million years [9] by applying the same brain imaging protocol as was employed for Drosophila [7]. In addition, it is assessed that the complete reconstruction of 1 mm3 of the cortex would require 10,000 man-years [10] and cost above $100 million [4]. Owing to the progress in imaging, the acquisition time constantly decreases. In particular, synchrotron X-ray tomography [11] is a promising imaging modality able to decrease the whole human brain acquisition time at the sub-cellular level to a few years [12] or even less. At present, for instance, by employing phase-contrast synchrotron tomography, whole brain imaging was performed in about 16 hours at a 25 μm spatial resolution with 16-bit voxels [13]. This level of spatial resolution enables imaging the neuronal cell bodies, however, it still is insufficient to reveal the complete neurons with their dendrites and axons as well as the synapses that functionally connect neurons. The creation of the nanoscale human connectome requires the segmentation of all neurons and the reconstruction of all neuronal microcircuits forming it, each microcircuit considered a sequence of synapses, so consequently comprehensive knowledge of synaptome, i.e., the complete set of all synapses in the brain. The synaptic architecture determines the limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders [14]. The goal of this work is to 1) formulate three (topology-, location-, and geometry-related) morphological models of the human synaptome at the nanoscale along with their simplified versions to reduce storage and 2) estimate storage requirements for these models. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in the literature, four cases of the total number of neurons in the brain (30;86;100; and 138 billion) and three cases of the number of synapses per neuron (1,000;10,000; and 30,000) are considered with three full and the corresponding simplified synaptic models resulting in total 72 cases of storage estimation. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data work providing the storage requirement estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome. The storage required for the synaptome can be calculated as (1) The number of synapses can be approximated by half of the product of the average number of neurons by the average number of synapses per neuron (a pair of the connected neurons form a synapse by the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, so to avoid duplication in synapse counting half of the product shall be taken) The average number of neurons in the human brain and the average number of synapses per neuron can be obtained from abundant literature studies whereas the storage required for a single synapse is determined from the synaptic morphology model considered below. The exact numbers of neurons and synapses in the human brain are challenging to precisely determine due to the brain’s complexity and variability and a brief, nearly 150-year, history of cell counting in human brains along with types of counting methods are presented by von Barthel [15]. Because of large biological variability among individual human brains and different brain regions as well as diverse cell counting methods employed, the number of neurons in the human brain and its parts reported in various studies highly ranges. For instance, in an average brain, a normal biological variation in the number of neocortical neurons occurs by a factor more than two [15]. Many textbooks, original articles, and reviews have affirmed that the total number of neurons in the human brain is one hundred billion [16–24]. This affirmation is also present in the textbook by Kandel et al. [18] which is a commonly used textbook in neuroscience (and even praised as the “bible of neuroscience” [15]) authored by a Nobel Prize laureate in physiology or medicine 2000. This textbook knowledge has been challenged by more robust methods for neuron number counting providing an estimate of 86.1 billion neurons [25]. In some other sources, the number of neurons in the entire human brain was estimated at 30 billion [26], 70–80 billion [27], 85 billion [28], 67–86 billion [29], and 75–125 billion [30]. The number of neurons in the cerebral cortex reported in various studies ranges from 2.6 billion [31] to 32 billion [32]. A majority of studies estimate this number between 10–20 billion neurons including 14 billion [33],10–19 billion [34], 18.8 billion [35], 12.4 billion [25], and 12.7 billion [29]. In the cerebellar cortex Haug estimated about 50 billion neurons [27] and Williams and Herrup 65–70 billion neurons [28], whereas Andersen et al. estimated 102 billion neurons in the human cerebellum (105 billion cells including 3 billion glial cells) [36]. Several studies imply that the range of 50–70 billion cerebellar neurons is the most credible, including 54 billion [29] and 69 billion [25]. The number of neurons together in the brainstem, striatum, and diencephalon is approximately 700 million [25]. The above studies are summarized in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t001 Many studies revealed that synapses are complex and diverse [37]. Moreover, their number can vary between individuals and change in response to learning and experience. Therefore, any estimates of their number should also be taken as an approximation. The number of synapses per neuron is also highly variable. Kandel et al. estimate that there are around 1014 (100 trillion) synapses in the average adult human brain [18] (meaning 1,000 synapses per neuron). Ref. [38] reports that the total number of synapses in the human neocortex is approximately 0.15×1015 (0.15 quadrillion). According to a reference book [39], the average neuron has 1,000 synapses with other neurons. Ten thousand connections per neuron are reported in [23]. Some sources estimate that a single neuron can have between 1,000–15,000 synaptic connections [24,40]. Defelipe demonstrated that the number of synapses per neuron is also cortical layer-dependent and the study of the synaptic profiles within cubes of cortical tissue of 50 μm wide by 50 μm thick revealed that for 158 neurons and 4,483,400 synapses examined in 6 cortical layers, the average number of synapses per neuron was 29,642 (100,042 in layer I (for 5 neurons only), 17,046 in layer II, 37,066 in layer IIIa, 56,521 in layer IIIb, 15,989 in layer IV, 29,965 in layer V, and 28,224 in layer VI) [41]. Hence, for the storage estimation, we take 3 values, 1,000, 10,000, and 30,000 synapses per neuron. To describe neuronal morphology at the nanoscale a dedicated nano neuronal format nN has been introduced [42] and accommodated here to model the synaptome. Let us assume that the whole brain has been imaged and all its neurons are already processed, and their synaptic axonal and dendritic terminals (also termed elements or membranes) are extracted and located in some Cartesian coordinate system. Let the terminal morphology be characterized by the coordinates of its center, radius, and identifier. Hence, the morphology of a dendritic terminal is described as follows Dendritic terminal identifier (D) Dendritic terminal coordinates (x,y,z) Dendritic terminal radius (r) The morphology of an axonal terminal is described in the following way Axonal terminal identifier (A) Axonal terminal coordinates (x,y,z) Axonal terminal radius (r) Consider two neurons forming a synapse meaning the following pair of pairs [(presynaptic neuron),(presynaptic axonal terminal);(postsynaptic neuron),(postsynaptic dendritic terminal)]. Let i and j be a presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron with identifiers Ni and Nj, and m and n the axonal terminal Aim and the dendritic terminal Djn of neurons i and j, respectively. Then, the synapse between the neurons i and j is defined as a pair of quadruples [Ni,Aim,(xim,yim,zim),rim;Nj,Djn,(xjn,yjn,zjn),rjn]. A synapse has three components, topology (the neuron and terminal identifiers), location (the coordinates of the terminal centers), and geometry (the terminal radii by approximating the fundi of the terminals with the circular shape), Fig 1. The complete synaptome is defined as a set of all the synapses {[Ni,Aim,(xim,yim,zim),rim;Nj,Djn,(xjn,yjn,zjn),rjn]} for all the presynaptic and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.g001 I consider three synaptic morphology models with diverse content and potential applications, namely, (1) the topologic model with topology, (2) the point model with topology and location, and (3) the geometric model with topology, location, and geometry. The topologic model encapsulates the topology of all presynaptic neurons along with the topology of the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology);(postsynaptic topology)}. The point model characterizes the topology and location of all presynaptic neurons and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology and location);(postsynaptic topology and location)}. The geometric model describes the topology, location, and geometry of all presynaptic neurons and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology, location, and geometry);(postsynaptic topology, location, and geometry)}. For the four considered cases of the number of neurons i.e. 30, 86, 100, and 138 billion, we get {3 1010, 86 1010, 1011, 1.38 1011} = {234.80, 236.32, 236.54, 237.01}. Hence, to store the neuron’s unique identifier out of other 30, 86, 100, or 138 billion neurons, 5 bytes (B) are needed in any of these four cases. For the three considered cases of the number of synapses per neuron, i.e., 1,000, 10,000, 30,000, we get {103, 104, 3 104} = {29.97, 213.29, 214.87}. Hence, for a given neuron to store its terminal’s unique identifier out of other 1,000, 10,000, or 30,000 terminals, 2 B are required in any of these three cases. The terminal coordinates are voxel resolution and synapse type dependent. There are two types of synapses, chemical with the synaptic gap (cleft) of 20-30/20-40 nm [43,44] and electrical with the 2–4 nm gap [43]. To distinguish the synapses, the acquisition data shall be sampled sufficiently dense and according to the Nyquist sampling theorem, the spatial sampling resolution shall be no lower than 10 nm to handle chemical synapses and 1 nm for the electrical synapses. To distinguish values at the levels of 10 nm and 1 nm spatial resolutions, the required ranges of values shall be 108 (226.6) for the 10 nm resolution and 109 (229.9) for the 1 nm resolution. Hence, 4 B are needed to store a terminal single coordinate value for each of the 10 nm and 1 nm voxel resolutions. To store a terminal location with 3 coordinates,12 B of storage are required. To store a terminal radius, 1 number meaning 4 B are needed. Hence, a single synapse storage determined by the synaptic model as a pair of (neuron, terminal) pairs requires (3) These values, because of an enormous number of synapses, will result in huge storage requirements so three simplifications are proposed to the synaptic model. First, in the full synaptic model for a given presynaptic neuron with identifier Ni its all presynaptic terminals Tim (each including the identifier, coordinates, and radius) are represented as a sequence of {[Ni,Ti1] … [Ni,Tim] … [Ni,TiM]}, where iM is the number of presynaptic terminals in neuron Ni. Since the neuron identifier is the same for all its presynaptic terminals, this sequence can be expressed as (Ni,{Tim}), m = 1 … iM. The number of presynaptic terminals is estimated as follows. Every presynaptic terminal (the presynaptic neuron’s output) has its corresponding postsynaptic terminal (the postsynaptic neuron’s input) so, consequently, the number of all neuronal inputs equals the number of all neuronal outputs. Therefore, on average we can assume that in an average neuron, half of its terminals are presynaptic and the other half postsynaptic. As the storage required for the presynaptic neuron’s terminals is for the considered cases at least three orders higher than that for the presynaptic neuron’s identifier, so the latter can be neglected. Second, the two sets of coordinates for the corresponding presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals can be approximated by a single set of coordinates with their mean value. Similarly, the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminal radii can be approximated by their mean value. Hence, the single synapse storage requirements for the simplified synapse model are the following (4) To estimate the storage required for the human synaptome Eq 2 is employed, where the single synapse storage for the full version of the synaptic model is determined by relationship (3) and for the simplified version of the synaptic model by relationship (4), the numbers of neurons in the average adult human brain and its parts are given in Table 1, and the numbers of synapses per neuron are provided in Section 2.3. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in numerous sources, four cases of neurons and three cases of synapses per neuron are considered. Additionally, taking into account three synaptic models with full and simplified versions, in total 72 cases providing the storage required for the synaptome are estimated. For 100 billion neurons each on average with 10 thousand synapses 0.5 x 14 x 1011 x 104 = 7 x 1015 = 7 petabyte (PB) storage is required for the full topologic model. The full point and geometric models need 19 PB and 23 PB, respectively. The simplified models require 4.5 PB, 10.5 PB, and 12.5 PB for the topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. For 86 billion neurons each on average with 10 thousand synapses these storage requirements reduce to 6.02 (3.87) PB, 16.34 (9.03) PB, and 19.78 (10.75) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. For 86 billion neurons each on average with one thousand synapses the storage requirements are 0.6 (0.39) PB, 1.63 (0.9.) PB, and 1.98 (1.08) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. The storage requirements for all 72 cases are given in Table 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t002 Similarly, by applying relationships (2)-(4) and Table 1, storage requirements for different parts of the brain can be estimated. Then, Table 3 provides the storage required for the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem/striatum/diencephalon for the case of 86 billion neurons in the entire brain (for consistency all the numbers are from the same source [25]) estimated for the full and simplified topologic, point, and geometric synaptic models. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t003 The same approach can, in general, be employed to estimate the data required for small brains, however, Eqs (3)–(4) are not directly applicable because the size of the synapse identifier is neuron and synapse number dependent. Let us estimate storage requirements for C.elegans [5]. To distinguish 7 x 103 = 212.77 synapses, 2B are required for the synapse identifier (with no need to apply the neuron identifier). Then, the single synapse storage needs 4 (2x2) B for the topologic model, 28 (2x2 + 2x3x4) B for the point model, and 36 (2x2 + 2x3x4+ 2x4) B for the geometric model. Hence, the full synaptic model of C.elegans with about 7,000 synapses requires around 28 KB for the topologic model, 196 KB for the point model, and 252 KB for the geometric model. For the simplified synaptic model, the single synapse storage needs 2 (1x2) B for the topologic model, 14 (1x2 + 1x3x4) B for the point model, and 18 (1x2 + 1x3x4+ 1x4) B for the geometric model. Therefore, the simplified synaptic model requires about 14 KB for the topologic model, 98 KB for the point model, and 126 KB for the geometric model. Let us estimate storage requirements for Drosophila. Scheffer et al. report that Drosophila has about 100,000 neurons and that the central hemibrain consists of approximately 25,000 neurons and around 20 million chemical synapses [45]. To estimate the storage required for Drosophila I use the information about the data size of the FlyWire dataset which is an electron microscopy reconstruction of the complete brain of an adult female Drosophila with about 130 thousand neurons and 32 million synapses representing the complete Drosophila brain [46–49]. Therefore, to distinguish 32 x 106 = 224.93 synapses, 4B are required for the synapse identifier. Then, the single synapse storage needs 8 (2x4) B for the topologic model, 32 (2x4 + 2x3x4) B for the point model, and 40 (2x4 + 2x3x4+ 2x4) B for the geometric model. Hence, the full synaptic model of Drosophila with 32 million synapses requires 256 MB for the topologic model, 1,024 MB for the point model, and 1,280 MB for the geometric model. For the simplified synaptic model, the single synapse storage needs 4 (1x4) B for the topologic model, 16 (1x4 + 1x3x4) B for the point model, and 20 (1x4 + 1x3x4+ 1x4) B for the geometric model. Therefore, the simplified synaptic model requires 128 MB for the topologic model, 512 MB for the point model, and 640 MB for the geometric model. The comparison of storage required for C.elegans, Drosophila, and human (for the case of 86 billion neurons in the entire brain and 1,000 synapses per neuron) estimated for the full and simplified topologic, point, and geometric synaptic models is presented in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t004 To evaluate the proposed method, the first large, nanoscale human brain tissue sample of a 1 mm3 [50] is employed here since a volumetric image dataset of the entire human brain at the nanoscale has not yet been acquired. The sample was surgically acquired from the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex, stained, embedded in resin, cut into ~30 nm thick sections, and scanned using electron microscopy. The resulting volume comprises 50,000 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites, and 150 million synapses. In [51] this volume was additionally annotated such that each neuron object had 19 attributes and each synapse object had seven attributes (synapse ID, synapse type, presynaptic site considered as an object, postsynaptic partner considered as an object, location, bounding box, and layer). To store the annotated properties of the synapses along with those of the neurons and layers, nearly 27 GB of storage was required. In our synaptic model, a synapse is characterized by identifier, location, and size whereas in [51] a synapse is annotated with seven attributes, so to enable a fairer comparison the geometric model is extended with 14 additional numbers, 12 for the four coordinates of a rectangular bounding box and one for each of synapse type and layer. Hence, the extended geometric model requires 46 + 14 x 4 = 102 B. This storage still may be underestimation, as here I consider the presynaptic and postsynaptic sites to be represented by indexes whereas in [51] they are represented as objects. The extended geometric model for 150 million synapses requires 102 x 150 x 106 = 15,300 x 106 = 15.3 GB. Taking into account that this extended geometric model is likely underestimation and that nearly 27 GB cited in [51] is needed not only for the synapses but also for the annotated cells and hundreds of millions of neurites, these two amounts of storage are roughly comparable. One of the fundamental challenges in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome. The key groups of challenges are data acquisition and computing. The acquisition produces big data and requires an enormous amount of time as already mentioned in the introduction. For very small brains, such as for the Drosophila brain, the acquired dataset can cover the entire adult brain, while in mammals the largest datasets include only a tiny fraction of a brain. For instance, a complete adult Drosophila brain was imaged with electron microscopy resulting in 7,050 40 nm thin sections forming a dataset of about 106 TB [46]. Regarding mammals, a tissue sample of the mouse lateral geniculate body having 67 million cubic microns of 400 x 600 x 280 resolution with about 100 trillion voxels yielded a dataset of about 100 TB [52]. A sample of 1 mm3 of mouse neocortex with 26,500 electron microscopy ultrathin sections with 4 nm/pixel resolution yielded a dataset of more than 2 petabytes [53]. Hence, a sample of 500 mm3 would have required a 1 exabyte storage. This dataset was continuously imaged across five microscopes for almost 6 months, each producing a daily throughput of 3.6 TB [53]. Not only acquisition but also validation is time consuming. To validate a hemibrain center of Drosophila assuming a rate of 1000 connections annotated per trained person, per day, would have taken more than 230 working years [45]. The first large nanoscale human brain tissue sample with 5,292 slices of 33 nm average thickness and 4 x4 nm2 pixels yielded a volume of approximately 2.1 PB [50]. The key computational challenges to achieve this goal are big data [2] and high-performance computing [3]. Although suitable data enabling the computation of the entire human connectome at the nanoscale have not been acquired yet, some of the computational challenges have already been addressed earlier [42,54,55]. I have previously formulated a dedicated nano neuronal data file format to describe neuron morphology at the nanoscale [42], estimated storage requirements to keep the volumetric and four geometric neuronal models (straight wireframe, enhanced wireframe, straight polygonal, and enhanced polygonal) [54], estimated high performance computing requirements for morphology modeling of the entire human brain at the nanoscale [55], and designed a nanoscale human brain atlas enabling the exploration of the brain model at the nanoscale [42]. As the connectome can be computed from the synaptome, toward the synaptome calculation I here present three morphologic models of the human nanoscale synaptome and quantitatively estimate the data bigness for storing them. These synaptome models are topologic, point, and geometric. Having the synaptome determined, any neuronal microcircuit is formed as a sequence of synapses whereas all the microcircuits, in turn, constitute the connectome. Any synaptic model introduced here enables the calculation of the connectome. The numbers of neurons and synapses in the human brain and its parts are highly variable and widely range in numerous studies reported; therefore, here I consider four cases of the total number of neurons in the entire brain including the minimum and maximum, and three cases of synapses per neuron in addition to the full and simplified versions of three synaptic models, topologic, point and geometric resulting in overall 72 cases. The storage required for the entire brain is estimated in the range from 30 billion neurons and 1 thousand synapses per neuron to 138 billion neurons and 30 thousand synapses per neuron. Then the full synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21 PB to 28.98 PB for the topologic model, from 0.57 PB to 78.66 PB for the point model, and from 0.69 PB to 95.22 PB for the geometric model, Table 2. For the simplified synaptic model, the topologic model requires from 0.14 PB to 18.63 PB, the point model from 0.32 PB to 43.47 PB, and the geometric model from 0.38 PB to 51.75 PB, Table 2. The simplified model reduces the required storage to 64%, 55%, and 54% for the topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. Note that in all these cases the maximum storage required is 138 times higher than the minimum storage. This results from the fact that the minimum and maximum numbers of neurons are likely to be outliers and a more credible number is 86 billion neurons [25]. Similarly, the approximate number of 30 thousand synapses per neuron reported by Defelipe [41] was measured for a very small tissue sample, so the range of 1–10 thousand synapses per neuron is likely to be more credible. Then, the storage required is from 0.60 (0.39) PB to 6.02 (3.87) PB, from 1.63 (0.90) PB to 16.34 (9.03) PB, and from 1.98 (1.08) PB to 19.78 (10.75) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. Note that then the difference between the minimum and maximum storage is 10 times only. The reported number of neurons in different parts of the brain also varies in the literature from 2.6 to 32 billion (12.31 times) for the cerebral cortex and from 50 to 102 billion for the cerebellum (2.04 times), Table 1. Taking the numbers of neurons from the same source [25], the cerebral cortex contains 14%, the cerebellum 80%, and the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon 0.8% of the total number of neurons in the entire human brain. Then, the full synaptic model of the cerebral cortex requires from 86.80 TB to 2.60 PB for the topologic model, from 235.60 TB to 7.07 PB for the point model, and from 285.20 TB to 8.56 PB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the cerebral cortex, the topologic model needs from 55.80 TB to 1.67 PB, the point model from 130.02 TB to 3.91 PB, and the geometric model from 155.00 TB to 4.65 PB, Table 3. The full synaptic model of the cerebellum requires from 0.48 PB to 14.49 PB for the topologic model, from 1.31 PB to 39.33 PB for the point model, and from 1.59 PB to 47.61 PB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the cerebellum, the topologic model needs from 0.31 PB to 9.32 PB, the point model from 0.72 PB to 21.74 PB, and the geometric model from 0.86 PB to 35.86 PB, Table 3. The full synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon requires from 4.90 TB to 147.00 TB for the topologic model, from 13.30 TB to 399.00 TB for the point model, and from 16.10 TB to 483.00 TB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon, the topologic model needs from 3.15 TB to 94.50 TB, the point model from 7.35 TB to 220.50 TB, and the geometric model from 8.75 TB to 262.50 TB, Table 3. Note that the above synaptome storage estimations are valid for both the chemical and electrical synaptomes, as the single synapse storage covers the data sampling spatial resolutions of 10 nm and 1 nm. A volumetric image dataset of the entire human brain at the nanoscale enabling the computation of the synaptome and connectome has not yet been acquired. Consequently, any validation of the considered synaptic model with the actual human data is not yet feasible. What is available today is the first large, nanoscale human surgical tissue sample of a 1 mm3 [50] which is employed here to assess the proposed method. Then, our geometric model extended to partly compensate for the seven synaptic annotation attributes in [51] requires 15.3 GB to store this sample whereas [51] reports nearly 27 GB to store the synapses together with the annotated cells and hundreds of millions of neurites. Therefore, these two amounts of storage can be considered roughly comparable. Note that the synaptic representation in [51] requires to store layers as acquired in electron microscopy, however, there is no need to store layers in synchrotron tomography data. Moreover, this is not so straightforward to compare our estimated synaptome data bigness with the actually acquired datasets. The actually acquired datasets can include the raw images, segmentation data, annotations, reconstructions, and various representations like skeletons and connectivity graphs. In addition, the size of data can vary depending on the image resolution, extent of the imaged brain, data format, data simplification, and applied data compression. Note that even for Drosophila, synaptome completeness is beyond the current reach resulting in providing synapse counts that are representatives [45]. On the other hand, our model and storage estimates assume the completeness of the human synaptome. Regarding small animal brains, the localization part of the synapse representation in Drosophila proposed by Scheffer et al. [45] corresponds to our synaptic point model. Namely, the synapses there are stored as point annotations meaning one point for a presynaptic T-bar (corresponding on electron microscopy images to an active zone of the presynaptic terminal), and one point for each of its postsynaptic densities in the postsynaptic terminal (note that some more complex synaptic structures found, e.g., in the cerebellum may exhibit multiple active zones and the corresponding multiple postsynaptic densities). However, the identifiers of the neurons containing their connecting synapses are determined from segmentation which assigns 64-bit neuron identifier to each voxel, meaning requiring 8 B for neuron and 6 B for voxel identifier to distinguish 26 teravoxels. Our point synaptic model scaled to the Drosophila size (see the Results section) requires only 4 B for the synapse identifier meaning it is 10 B smaller per synapse than the synaptic data representation employed by Scheffer et al. [45]. The same method applied here to estimate the storage required for the human synaptome can, in principle, also be used to estimate synaptomes of other animals after the compensation for the synapse identifier dependency on the numbers of neuron and synapses. Namely, the synaptoms of Drosophila and C.elegans are “merely” at the level of megabytes and kilobytes, respectively (Table 4) in comparison to the human synaptome which requires storage at the level of petabytes. Even though the synaptic topologic model for the entire brain is much smaller than each of the synaptic point and geometric models, it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience such as Sequoia of 1.5 PB and K of 1.4 PB of memory [2]. For the number of neurons in the range of 86–100 billion, only the case of 1,000 synapses per neuron can fit to this storage (and up to about 2,000 synapses per neuron) whereas the case of 10,000 synapses per neuron does not fit. Note that the simplified point and geometric models for the 1,000 synapses per neuron also fit this amount of storage. For the cerebral cortex with 12.4 billion neurons (Table 1) and in the range of 1,000–10,000 synapses per neuron, the full topologic and simplified point models fit the amount of memory provided by Sequoia or K. Today’s most powerful and world’s first exascale supercomputer Frontier [56] with 9,408 computing nodes each with 4 TB of flash memory offers an overall 37 PB memory. Frontier, for the synaptic model of the entire brain with 86 billion neurons and the 1,000–10,000 range of the number of synapses per neuron, is able to handle the human nanoscale synaptome, and for 30,000 synapses per neuron only the simplified topologic, point, and geometric models. Another exascale supercomputer Aurora with the aggregate system memory of 10.9 PB [57] for 86 billion neurons is able to handle only the simplified synaptic models up to 10,000 synapses per neurons. The storage of the above supercomputers serves as a benchmark for our results. In general, the storage limits of the today’s supercomputers can be overcome either by a network of powerful supercomputers enabling to scale computing resources, such as BRAINS [58], or cloud storage offered by open-source services, such as the Brain Observatory Storage Service and Database which is a cloud-based solution for storing and accessing petascale image datasets [59]. The topologic model is sufficient and the most efficient to compute the connectome or rather its topology. The synaptic point model allows for the construction of the connectomic point model with the locations of the synapses. The synaptic geometric model enables the construction of the connectomic geometric model with the locations and sizes of the synapses. Note that these connectomic models do not allow to construct the exact full path between the consecutive synapses in a microcircuit as in the synaptic model the parameters of the soma, axon, and dendritic and axonal trees (as formulated in [42]) are not available (meaning can be discarded after the calculation of the synaptome). The introduced synaptic models are useful for morphometric and network-related analyses. The topologic model allows for the determination of the number of microcircuits, loops, and feedbacks. The point model enables the calculation of synaptic densities and patterns of interconnectivity such as distributions of microcircuits with respect to length, underlying structures and tracts, and local and global networks (subsystems). In particular, this includes the distribution of microcircuits among the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and subcortical structures as well as their distribution among the cerebral and cerebellar cortical layers. Other network-related features also can be calculated including clusters (hubs), worldness, betweenness centrality, and motifs. The geometric model additionally enables the calculation of the distribution of the terminal sizes (provided that they, especially the postsynaptic terminals, are feasible to be determined). Storage-wise this work is limited to the size of the already calculated synaptome. However, its calculation requires a much bigger storage to handle all the neurons along with their complete dendritic and axonal trees as estimated in [54]. In addition, synchrotron tomography requires also space for numerous projections from which the volumetric raw data are calculated. Depending on the spatial resolution, the volumetric raw data require from 2,800 exabytes (EB) for 10 nm resolution (to image chemical synapses) to 2,800,000 (EB) for 1 nm resolution (to image electrical synapses) [54]. By converting the volumetric raw data into a geometric model, the storage required, depending on the type of geometric model, ranges from 20.56 PB to 82.56 PB for 86 billion neurons and 10,000 synapses per neuron [54]. Model-wise this work is restricted to synaptome morphology although the synaptome size can be expected to be much higher at the molecular level. For instance, in [60] the mouse synaptome was considered at the molecular level by cataloging and mapping enormous synapse diversity. Namely, the postsynaptic proteome contains more than 1,000 proteins whereas as few as 10 proteins could produce 1,023 types and 1011 subtypes of excitatory synapses. Neurodegenerative processes cause death of neurons and synapse loss, degeneration of synapses, and the spread of pathology through the brain via synapses. Therefore, the study of synaptome is also vital from the standpoint of synaptopathy, meaning the disturbances in neuronal connectivity, which with the increasing awareness is one of the first pathological even in many neurologic disorders [40]. Studies of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [61–64], dementia with Lewy bodies [65], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [66] demonstrated changes in synaptic density and morphology as well as molecular composition and the aggregation of disease-associated proteins in the synapse which may disrupt its structure and function. In AD, the loss of synapses also correlates with a cognitive decline [61,63]. Moreover, some evidence indicates that synaptopathy underlines a variety of psychiatric disorders [67]. The involvement of synaptic disturbances in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia was reviewed by Obi-Nagata et al. [24]. The schizophrenic patients were observed to have the reduced dendritic spine density [68–70]. Glanz et al. [68] reported that in schizophrenic subjects, spine density in the prefrontal cortex was decreased by 23% compared with normal control subjects. Garey et al. [69] demonstrated the 66% dendritic spine density decrease in frontal regions and 59% decrease in temporal regions in cortical layer III. Konopaske et al. [70] observed that the number of spines per dendrite was reduced by 21.6% for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The decrease in spine number was only observed for smaller spines and not for larger spines [71] resulting in less plastic circuits (as large spines are generally highly stable and small spines are more plastic and related to learning and behavioral flexibility [72]). Therefore based on these studies, this is likely to expect the storage required for the synaptome of persons with neurologic disorders to be smaller than that needed for the normal subjects. It remains still unclear how generalizable are these findings across all cortical layers and the entire cerebral cortex. Nevertheless, assuming in average a 25% spine density decrease for the whole cerebral cortex and taking 86 billion neurons in the entire brain, the required storage for the diseased cerebral cortical synaptome would range from the minimum of 41.85 TB for the topologic simplified model with 1,000 synapses per neuron to the maximum of 6417 TB for the full geometric model with 30,000 synapses per neuron (compare with Table 3). Finally comparing the human genome and synaptome, the storage required for the human genome varies (depending on coverage) from 30 GB to 200 GB [73] and it seems today rather “small” in comparison to that required for the human nanoscale synaptome that is at the level of petabytes. However, to store hundreds of thousands of human genomes it is estimated that 2–40 EB of storage capacity will be needed by 2025 [73]. As a similar trend may be expected in neuroscience, this estimation gives some idea of how enormous storage will be required to store hundreds of thousands of human synaptomes and connectomes. A key challenge in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome which requires knowledge of synaptome forming the neural microcircuits. The synaptic architecture determines the limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders. Toward this objective, I here address morphology modeling and storage estimation for the human synaptome at the nanoscale. The storage required for the human synaptome depends on the number of synapses and the storage necessary for a single synapse determined by a synaptic model. I here introduce three synaptic morphology models with diverse content and potential applications: topologic with topology, point with topology and location, and geometric with topology, location, and geometry. They are useful for morphometric and network-related analyses. The topologic model allows for the determination of the number of microcircuits, loops, and feedbacks. The point model enables the calculation of synaptic densities and patterns of interconnectivity. The geometric model additionally enables the calculation of the distribution of terminal sizes. The number of neurons in the human brain and its parts reported in various studies highly ranges because of large biological variability among individual brains and different cerebral regions as well as diverse cell counting methods employed. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the number of neurons and synapses reported in numerous sources, four cases of the number of neurons in the brain (30; 86; 100; and 138 billion) and three cases of synapses per neuron (1,000; 10,000; and 30,000) are considered with three synaptic models with the full and simplified (to reduce storage) versions resulting in total 72 cases for which the storage required for the synaptome is estimated. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21(0.14) PB to 28.98(18.63) PB for the topologic model, from 0.57(0.32) PB to 78.66(43.47) PB for the point model, and from 0.69(0.38) PB to 95.22(51.75) PB for the geometric model. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the cerebral cortex needs from 86.80(55.80) TB to 2.60(1.67) PB for the topologic model, from 235.60(130.02) TB to 7.07(3.91) PB for the point model, and from 285.20(155.00) TB to 8.56(4.65) PB for the geometric model. The full synaptic model of the cerebellum requires from 0.48(0.31) PB to 14.49(9.32) PB for the topologic model, from 1.31(0.72) PB to 39.33(21.74) PB for the point model, and from 1.59(0.86) PB to 47.61(35.86) PB for the geometric model. The full (simplified) synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon requires from 4.90(3.15) TB to 147.00(94.50) TB for the topologic model, from 13.30(7.35) TB to 399.00(220.50) TB for the point model, and from 16.10(8.75) TB to 483.00(262.50) TB for the geometric model. The topologic model is sufficient and the most efficient to compute the connectome or rather its topology, however, even though it is much smaller than each of the synaptome point and geometric models, it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience such as Sequoia of 1.5 PB and K of 1.4 PB of memory (and for the number of neurons in the range of 86–100 billion, only neurons with up to about 2,000 synapses can fit to this storage). The most powerful world’s supercomputer Frontier for the entire brain with 86 billion neurons and the 1,000–10,000 number of synapses per neuron is able to handle the human nanoscale synaptome, and for 30,000 synapses per neuron only the simplified topologic, point, and geometric models. The storage limits of today’s supercomputers can be overcome either by a network of powerful supercomputers enabling to scale computing resources or cloud storage offered by open-source services. The human synaptome requires storage at the level of petabytes whereas the synaptoms for Drosophila and C.elegans are “merely” at the level of megabytes and kilobytes, respectively. In the future, to store hundreds of thousands of human synaptomes and connectomes, storage at the level of exabytes or higher will be required. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data effort attempting to provide storage requirement estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome. This work has been inspired by the SYNAPSE (Synchrotron for Neuroscience–an Asia-Pacific Strategic Enterprise) efforts aiming to map the entire human brain at sub-cellular resolution demonstrating the neuronal network connections and my invited talk presented at the SYNAPSE 2022 general meeting. I would like to thank Prof. Ann-Shyn Chiang, the creator of the Drosophila connectome, for providing valuable insights regarding connectomic data size.

Good morning! I've been known to make a bet or two in my day, which is why I'm wondering the odds you could get betting you'd have four kids with the same birthday. In today's big story, the economy is heading in the right direction, but consumers aren't buying it. What's on deck: But first, the vibes are all off. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit, writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Alphabet shares target cut, keeps outperform on investor concern
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/alphabet-shares-target-cut-keeps-outperform-on-investor-concern-93CH-3631984
Time Published: 2024-09-25T12:53:46Z

On Wednesday, Oppenheimer has revised its price target for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares, the parent company of Google, reducing it to $185 from the previous $210. Despite the price target adjustment, the firm maintains an Outperform rating on the stock. The reduction in the price target comes amid investor concerns over Google's search engine being labeled a monopoly and the potential loss of its exclusivity with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. Google is responsible for generating 31% of its gross search revenue, amounting to $61 billion, through Apple devices. It pays Apple 36% of that revenue to maintain exclusivity, which translates to 19% of Google's net ad exposure. Oppenheimer's assessment suggests that Google would only need to retain 65% of search activity from Apple users if no Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) are paid, or 75% if TAC drops to 15%. This comes in the context of a survey from April indicating that 75% of users would choose Google as their default search engine, and 78% would download Chrome if Google Search was not available in Safari. The firm also noted the separate Department of Justice case against Google's Adtech business, estimating it to represent less than 2% of Alphabet's equity value. The new stock price target of $185 is based on a 20x multiple of the company's expected 2026 earnings, discounted at 8%, or a 21x multiple of the 2025 estimated earnings, compared to the NASDAQ's average P/E ratio of 25x. In other recent news, Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, is facing a $9.3 billion antitrust lawsuit in the UK, which it has asked a tribunal to dismiss. The suit alleges Google has abused its dominance in the online search market. Simultaneously, Alphabet Inc. has successfully overturned a 1.49 billion euro ($1.66 billion) antitrust fine imposed by the EU, originally levied for practices that allegedly hindered rivals in the online search advertising market. In the realm of financial analysis, TD Cowen has maintained a Buy rating for Alphabet, suggesting that potential changes in Google's default search engine status on Apple's Safari browser may not significantly affect Google's 2026 U.S. Search revenue. Meanwhile, DA Davidson has initiated a neutral rating for Alphabet, outlining potential challenges and opportunities for the company, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence. In terms of regulatory actions, the EU is currently directing Google to cease anti-competitive actions within its advertising technology sector, with a breakup order not expected at this time. However, the European Commission may consider such a measure in the future if Google continues its anti-competitive behavior. These are the recent developments surrounding Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary, Google. As investors digest Oppenheimer's revised price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), it is valuable to consider some key financial metrics and expert analysis that could further inform their decisions. Alphabet's market capitalization stands robust at $2.02 trillion, reflecting its significant presence in the tech industry. Notably, Alphabet is trading at a P/E ratio of 23.1, which is attractive when paired with its near-term earnings growth prospects. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in relation to its expected earnings expansion. Another InvestingPro Tip worth mentioning is the company's strong financial position, as it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide resilience against market volatility and strategic flexibility. Moreover, Alphabet's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stands at an impressive 13.38%, with a gross profit margin of 57.64%, indicating efficient operations and a strong market position. For investors seeking more comprehensive insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips, including Alphabet's status as a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry and its ability to cover interest payments comfortably with its cash flows. In total, there are 10 more InvestingPro Tips available for Alphabet, which can be found at https://www.investing.com/pro/GOOG, providing a deeper dive into the company's financial health and market outlook.

Title: Gen Z are ‘conscious unbossing’—they’re avoiding stressful middle management roles

Tech giants have spent the last two years culling their middle managers. Amazon was the latest to send theirs to the chopping block just last week. Now, Gen Zers don’t even want to climb the greasy pole. In fact, 72% of the youngest generation of workers say they’d rather progress in an individual contributor role than become middle managers, according to the recruitment firm Robert Walters. Although just 16% of the 3,600 Gen Zers surveyed said that they will avoid middle management at all cost, it’s clear that the majority of young people today aren’t keen on the idea of managing others. Over half of Gen Zers expressed that they don’t want to be middle managers, as part of a trend that has been dubbed ‘conscious unbossing.’ Even the 36% of respondents who said they do anticipate stepping into a managerial position at some point in their careers, admitted they don’t actually want to. It’s not that Gen Z workers don’t want success—they’d just rather it didn’t come with the responsibility of managing others. Lucy Bisset, a director at Robert Walters, said that Gen Z prefers to bring their “whole self to projects and spend time cultivating their own brand and approach, rather than spending time managing others.” A clear example of this is the rise in young people ditching the corporate rat race to become their own boss—or an influencer. According to LinkedIn, the second fastest-growing job title among Gen Z grads right now is “founder.” Read more from Fortune –Sam Altman says it’s relentless and all-consuming to run OpenAI teams after shock CTO departure –YouTube’s MrBeast looks for ‘obsessed’ employees to help run his $700 million company, per leaked handbook –Here’s what actually makes employees happy and more likely to stay at their jobs –Laurene Powell Jobs is one of Kamala Harris’s biggest bankrollers—and closest friends –‘As painful as disruption is, it’s not negotiable’ says CarMax’s CEO Meanwhile, separate data shows that more than half of Gen Z say they would become full-time influencers if they had the opportunity, and the percentage has only gone up in surveys dating back to 2019. “My generation don’t want to go work a consulting or banking job. They don’t even want to be an astronaut anymore,” Steven Schwartz, the Gen Z founder and CEO of the multimillion-dollar marketplace Whop previously told Fortune. “They want to make content online, they want to find customers online… Being educated with more information about what people can do, why would they want to do something that isn’t the most elite experience and the most fun for them?” Really, it’s hard to know whether Gen Zers would actually turn down management roles. With the oldest of the generation turning 27 this year, many won’t have been offered the opportunity to step up yet—but it’s hardly surprising they’ve been put off. Having joined the world of work during tech company’s quest for “efficiency,” Gen Z has repeatedly been sent the message that middle managers are disposable. At Google, where 12,000 managers lost their jobs last year, workers have been told it will be harder to get promoted into management roles going forward. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Zuckerberg said that “flattening” its internal hierarchy was core to its restructure last year. He credited Elon Musk as the source of inspiration behind having “fewer layers of management.” In fact, middle-management positions accounted for almost one-third of layoffs in 2023, Bloomberg found, up from 20% in 2018—and the “great unbossing” trend hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he wants to “increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15%” (by cutting the number of managers at the tech giant). What’s more, even middle managers who haven’t been laid off are opting to walk out of the role. Earlier this year, a global study found that 75% of millennial managers feel overwhelmed, stressed, and burnt out. As a result, many are eyeing the exit and looking for non-management gigs. Is it any wonder that when Robert Waters asked young people why they’re turning their noses up at middle management jobs, nearly 70% responded: “Too high stress, low reward.” “Those new to middle management experience a steep step-up in workload, further expectations to be ‘always available’ to those they manage, as well continuing pressure to hit their own targets,” Bisset explained. “It’s clear how these roles can prove overwhelming and deter many from taking on the extra responsibility.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

September 25, 2024 07:09 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.

Title: What to do if you left it late to start investing

You partied in your 20s and 30s. Or you had kids early and there was no money leftover. Or perhaps you got divorced and your partner took the lot. Bottom line: you’re late to start investing. Are you doomed to eat cat food in your retirement? To be grinding out another shift in your 80s as the oldest barista on the block? Probably not – provided you to take sufficient action now to turn things around. You’ll need to be more focussed than a younger saver though, without their head start. And maybe you should do a few things differently. Imagine you’ve woken up penniless after 20 years in a coma – long of hair, but short of time. The good news? You avoided selfies, Brexit, Covid, social media, and the last series of Game Of Thrones. However you also missed out on two decades of compound interest effortlessly growing your wealth. It’s a financial morality tale is as old as time spreadsheets, handed down from bloggers to Twitter pundits to TikTok influencers. Person A and Person B both start work in their early 20s. They earn the same salary. Person A notices there are a lot of old people around and begins to save, before they too get old. Person B imagines they’ll wear crop tops forever, eats out or orders in every day, spends everything, saves nothing, and reaches their 40s with little to show for it except for a pretty Instagram account. Run the numbers and Person A may already be headed for a comfortable retirement in their early 60s. But person B will need to save much more – and/or for much longer – just to catch-up. We’ve marvelled at the mathematical wonder of compound interest on Monevator before: Consider two investors: Captain Sensible and Captain Blithe. From the age of 25, Captain Sensible invests £2,000 per year in an ISA for 10 years until he is 35. At 35 he stops and never puts another penny into his fund again. Captain Sensible then leaves his nest egg untouched to grow until he hits age 65. He earns an average annual return of 8% and when he looks at his account 30 years later, he has £314,870 to play with. Captain Blithe, meanwhile, spends the lot between the ages of 25 to 35. Only when he hits 35 does he sober up and start tucking away £2,000 per year in his ISA. He keeps this up for the next 30 years until he reaches 65. Captain Blithe earns an average annual return of 8%, too. He ends up with £244,691. To recap: – Captain Sensible has invested a total of £20,000. – Captain Blithe has invested a total of £60,000. Yet Captain Sensible’s pile is worth over 28% more than the late-starting Captain Blithe’s – even though Sensible only invested a third of the amount. Compound interest takes a while to get interesting. All things equal, the earlier you start, the bigger your pension snowball will be by the time you’re old enough to start worrying about it. Of course hearing “you should have started earlier” isn’t any more welcome in personal finance than when you’re facing last dibs at a swingers’ party. There’s not much you can do about that now. What matters is how to best proceed. The good news is that beginning in 2012 most people have been auto-enrolled into pensions at work. But if this came too late for you – or if you didn’t put enough away – then start addressing things today. To catch up with swots like me who were aggressively saving by age 23, you have two broad routes: Clearly you can also pick-and-mix from these options. But know that all of them – from making your own lunch to save an extra tenner to gambling your life savings on a start-up – come with potential risks, rewards, and the chance of outright failure. Risky bets like putting real money into the likes of Bitcoin might well speed up your gains. But very often taking bigger or less orthodox risks will see you do worse. People try to get rich quick because it promises a shortcut, not because of any stellar track record. So you must consider the options for yourself and chart your own course. Just for the record, we strongly advise against robbing a bank! We’ve looked at devising your investing plan before, and also how much you can eventually withdraw from a portfolio. But before you get to that good stuff, you need to understand how far behind you are – and what investing success would look like. When it comes to retirement, success mostly means meeting your annual spending requirements with a low risk of running out of money. So you’ll want know how much you’ll need – realistically – to spend in your retirement years. A good way to get a handle on this number is to track your current spending. Use that as a base to figure out your budget, adjusting as seems appropriate. For instance, fewer work suits in retirement, but more gardening magazines. For a quick start though, see estimates from the likes of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) and Which magazine. Here are the latest annual retirement income figures from the PLSA: Source: PLSA All figures like this are controversial (read a relevant Monevator comment thread for a taste) because our expectations are all different. So it’s always best to work out your own figures if you can. But for the purposes of a late-starter getting – well – started, ballpark figures will help you to zero-in on the scale of the challenge. From there you can estimate the size of retirement pot you’ll need to generate your desired income – in conjunction with your State Pension – and so what shortfall you face, especially as a later starter. You can always further refine your numbers as you go. So you’re on the wrong side of those Sensible Sarah versus Spendy Samuel spreadsheets? Let’s look at your main evasive action options, with links to further reading. By far your best remedial action is to put much more of your salary into your retirement pot. Ideally in the most tax-advantaged way. Every penny you save rather than spend today is more income for your future self. Also, by getting used to a leaner household budget now, you may be happier making do with less when you do retire. Crucially, your savings rate is one lever that’s mostly under your control – unlike say investment returns or how many healthy working years you have left. Remember there are young FIRE-seekers who are targeting retirement in their 30s or early 40s by saving hard and investing. To some extent you can flip that script, copying their tactics to catch-up late. Another sure winner. Every year you stay in paid employment is (a) an extra year to put savings away, (b) another year for your pension pot to compound, and (c) one less year in retirement that your pension has to pay for. Working for longer is probably not the most appealing prospect, but maybe you can make lemonade out of lemons and enjoy a late bloom at work? Or pivot to a second career? Our final years in work are usually extra-valuable because earnings are higher at the end of our careers than at the start. (Though professional footballers and lap-dancers may need to pursue a different tack). Normally we think it’s a good idea to save into both an ISA and a pension, given they are both tax-efficient wrappers. That’s because money in an ISA is much more accessible – which can be a huge benefit if you need it. But saving into a pension usually has a numerical edge due to tax-bracket arbitrage, salary sacrifice, and the tax-free lump sum you can withdraw on retirement. As a late starter, ISA savings may be a luxury you can’t afford. Run the numbers to see if you’re better-off throwing everything you can into your pension in your precious remaining work years. Maximise your employer’s pension match Your employer is obligated to chip in 3% of your qualifying earnings into your pension under the workplace pension rules. You must contribute 5% of your earnings (though this will cost you less in take home pay terms, after tax relief) for a total minimum contribution of 8%. Some employers are more generous though, and will match further contributions you make up to some limit. This is effectively a hike to your salary, albeit a pay raise that you must put into your pension. Contribution matching is an unbeatably cost-effective way to turbo-charge your savings rate, so you should almost always try to maximise your employer’s contributions. (Ideally via salary sacrifice). Locking more money away for decades probably won’t come easy if you’ve been a spender all your life. At least as an oldie you’re closer to the age where you’re allowed to get your hands on the money again… I hear you: no shit Sherlock: “Earn more money so I can save more money. Why didn’t I think of that?” Understood. But it’s worth a second reminder that how much you can feed into the hopper of your retirement investing engine is what will largely determine what you can spend in retirement. Maybe you planned to coast as a team leader rather than pushing hard to become a department head? Or to stay in a steady public sector job, rather than following your former colleagues into the tougher but more lucrative private sector? Obviously I don’t know your work situation. The permutations are endless. My point is just that easing up and retiring early isn’t on the horizon for you. So maybe knuckle down and work harder instead? Think of it as the bill coming due for all that spending you did 20 years ago… Okay, we’re heading into more controversial territory. But if you can stomach the extra volatility, then it might be worth running your portfolio a little hotter in the hope of bigger gains. What would this look like? For a passive investor it means a larger allocation to equities – such as your global tracker fund – and holding less in defensive assets like bonds, cash, and gold. For example, instead of the industry standard 60/40 portfolio split between equities and bonds, perhaps you’d go 75/25 instead. In theory, you can expect (but not be certain) to earn higher returns over the long term with a higher allocation to equities. The price you’ll pay will be a bumpier ride – and the potential for unlikely but possible lower final returns. (Here’s how that could happen). Remember: the market doesn’t care about your pension predicament nor your hopes for higher returns. Markets will certainly crash from time to time – in the worst case right as you retire – so do keep the riskiness of your portfolio under review as you get older and your pot grows. This is even riskier again, and definitely not for everyone. But if you find yourself in your early 40s, say, with inadequate pension savings when your ‘What About My Retirement?’ lightbulb goes off, then gunning for expected equity returns of 6-10% (hopefully) and tax relief in a pension may make more sense than paying off mortgage debt costing you 5%, say. There’s a panoply of options here, from choosing not to make overpayments on a traditional mortgage to switching to an interest-only option, to remortgaging to extend your mortgage term. All these paths have downsides. Such risks are what ‘pays’ for the potential upside from getting more money growing in your pension for longer. I’ve written a lot about these pros and cons before. And like I did then, I’ll stress again that paying down a mortgage ASAP is also a fine strategy – even for late starters. You can always go on a massive savings push once you’ve cleared the mortgage. Even if it’s not the financially optimal path, clearing your debts may be more motivational for you. That matters! I’d certainly urge you to reject any other kind of debt when borrowing to invest. Mortgages are low cost, they buy you somewhere to live, and they’re not marked-to-market, so you won’t face a sudden cash call during a stock market rout. Other kinds of debt are much more expensive and/or risky. Is amping up the conventional approach not moving the dial for you? Have you left it so late – or are your ambitions are so big – that you need more money than 20 years of diligent plodding can possibly deliver? Let’s run through a few more disruptive alternatives. Maybe you can’t hack the rat race anymore in your late 60s, but you could live with doing a few more years of lower-stress work? So-called ‘BaristaFIRE’ involves earning a bit through the sweat of your brow or muscles to top-up the income from your retirement portfolio. Like this you can survive with a smaller retirement portfolio. It takes a six-figure capital sum to generate £3,000 to £6,000 a year in retirement (a wide band to reflect the vast range of starting points, end points, and all the rest). So earning say £10,000 a year from part-time work can make up for a lot of missing invested money. But I probably wouldn’t work at a coffee shop or similar, if I’d been a high-earner in my main career and money was my main BaristaFire motivation. Most Monevator readers should instead pursue part-time or consulting work in the same vein as their lifelong profession. Doing so will maximise the kerching!-to-effort ratio. I believe everyone has a passion, hobby, aptitude, spare bedroom, or the free time to make £5,000 to £20,000 a year to supplement their main income – without the risks of quitting work to start a business. You may disagree, which is fine but is also perhaps why you’re behind on your retirement savings… The truth is options abound and I can’t list them all here. Be creative, test and iterate, and back yourself. The better pushback is that for a high-earner, it’s not worth messing around with side hustles for £10,000 a year when they are earning £100,000+ in their day job. And I agree. Such people are probably better off getting promotions or doing more overtime. But for the average earner on £35,000, say, the extra cashflow of £5,000 from a side-project can go straight to the bottom line to massively boost your pension savings. Of course if you want to make really big bucks then starting a proper business is one of the best ways. Perhaps the only way for most for us. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy – or in fact less than unlikely or near-impossible. (Beware survivorship bias!) The risks vary. If you’re trying to create a start-up software business, say, or to launch a restaurant, then your chances of success are low. Data suggests 90% of startups fail. But if you’re an established architect wanting to set up your own practice doing what you already do and with an existing book of contacts, for example, then there’s surely less risk of outright failure. Either way, your workload goes through the roof when you run your own business. By all means be an entrepreneur if it’s your life goal. But I wouldn’t quit work to start a business to try to fix my pension pot. Some active investors do beat the market. A handful even over the long-term. Warren Buffett, I’m looking at you. You’re not Warren Buffett and you haven’t got much chance of finding the next Buffett, either. But if you can – or if you have edge yourself and so can pick your own stocks to beat the market – then by definition this will increase your long-term returns. Perhaps there’s a case for investing into a few previously proven but out-of-favour active funds that might recover over the long-term, if you really want to roll the dice. Say with 25% of an otherwise passive equity allocation. Examples as I write could be investment trusts like Scottish Mortgage, Finsbury Growth & Income, Pershing Square Holdings, and RIT Capital Partners. These funds have all compounded money very well over the long-term but are more or less in a funk right now. And they all sit on big discounts. To be clear though, there’s zero guarantee that these or any other active funds will beat the market again in the future. And needless to say you should not take my top-of-head list as any sort of investment advice. Do your own research! Remember: you’ll probably do worse if you invest actively. You’re unlikely to beat the market and you’ll pay more in fees for trying. But there’s always a chance… so onto the list it goes. Some ways of making money sit between investing and running a business. Moves like investing into a family or friend’s franchise business, running a multi-unit buy-to-let portfolio via a limited company, or reserving property off-plan in the hope of flipping it for a profit later. These are idiosyncratic investments where the outcome will be about your aptitude – and luck – rather than what the S&P 500 does. Again, possibilities abound. I’d suggest looking at areas close to your own professional expertise. You might have some kind of edge or insight there. For example, if you’re a dentist then perhaps you know there’s a need for a new multi-practice building in your local area? You could be part of a consortium that gets it built and occupied. That sort of thing. Good luck! There’s no end of other high risk, high reward ‘opportunities’ out there. And yes – I’m lifting my fingers off the keyboard to put ‘opportunities’ into air quotes because one person’s reasoned speculation is another person’s reckless gamble. If not a borderline scam. Into this bucket we might put everything from punting on cryptocurrencies to extreme concentration into just a few company stocks (putting it all into nVidia, say) to investing more than a small percentage of your net worth into a handful of private or crowdfunded start-ups. I would define this category as anything where if a hundred of us have a stab, 90 of us will lose some or all our money – or at the least lag the market in the case of listed shares – but 5-10% might see huge returns. So as the man once said: “Do you feel lucky, punk?” Personally, I would again at most ring-fence a portion of my assets for such antics. Maybe a maximum 10% allocation. That way if I did pick a winner it would meaningfully move the dial, but if – as is most likely – it goes tits up then I’m not too far further behind on my goals. If you say “No way, not touching this stuff with a bargepole” then I can only applaud your good sense. We all know other ways to get rich that aren’t written about on worthy websites like Monevator. And as an upstanding citizen I don’t recommend any of them. Besides the moral issues, do you really want to risk your reputation or your liberty for the sake of a slightly comfier retirement? Perhaps marrying rich is the exception. But I’m the wrong person to ask about marriage, as I see mostly risks… Maybe read some Jane Austen! For some of our regular readers, this post will have seemed like one long ‘obviously’. Such people began saving and investing when they were very young maybe, or they’re on the other side of work already and enjoying the fruits of their labours. Good for them! However I do regularly hear from people with proper jobs and responsibilities who’ve no idea where they stand or what to do about their pensions – and they’re sometimes only ten to 20 years from retirement. If that’s you, then don’t panic. Follow the links in this article, learn more, and begin to create your plan. For most non-investment crazed would-be retirees, I’d suggest stick mostly (or entirely) to the sober tactics, with maybe an added side hustle. Beyond that you could perhaps make a modest 5-10% allocation to a few out-of-favour trusts or to very carefully chosen long-shot bets in the hope – but not expectation – of faster gains. But you must figure out what works best for you. Who knows? You might even have fun doing so. I’m sure I’ve missed out a few possibilities above.

I imagine there are plenty of people who look no further than the headline salary when considering moves, rather than the wider benefits package. Certainly worth paying attention to in debates about public vs private sector. @tetromino — Good point, I should surface that explicitly. Will add a bit now before sending out the email. Thanks! For the love of God, if you must eat pet food in your dotage, go with dog food, not cat food. Have you seen what they put in cat food? > But person B will need to save much more – and/or for much longer – just to catch-up. More, yes. They will probably be earning rather more than their younger self. If they can reduce their outgoings there’s more tax they’ll be saving of what goes into the pension. Anyway, I’ll stand up as the poster child for the Johnny-come-lately non-recommended way. Barista-FIRE was what I was frightened of. It was a rough experience for three years, and I had good luck to be doing it after a market crash. And I survived/eventually thrived over a decade of active investing, though arguably tutored by Monevator in the early days. So under some circumstances you can get there from here. While I did manage to avoid debt (apart from mortgage) from my early twenties, it absolutely beats me how you get to save money when you’re young. Perhaps living in London through my twenties was my mistake, and perhaps living away from home was another – it was looked down on in the same way as Thatcher’s view on buses and how folk play the mating game under their parents’ roof puzzles me. The general point remains. Young people just don’t usually have much spare money – they’re earning less at the start of their careers and their outgoings are higher as they establish themselves. I didn’t start saving for a pension until I was 29 and I cleared the workforce in my early fifties, because I couldn’t stand what it had become. Re investing, think key point is just make a start. Initially it may seem pointless but get the saving going on an automatic basis and take any employer pension contribution you can. Biggest risk is divorce. Choose your partner carefully ( or just do without). My charm and good looks meant I swerved that one but boy have I seen some financial casualties. Some were emotionally upset too. However old age care fees are just an apocalyptic horseman…have an extra £300k for those. This is me at age 49. Was always conservative with money but on divorce found myself starting over. Its a mix of investing hard (over 30% of income) and running a 85/15 equities/bond portfolio using SIPP and ISA. The result is I’m back on track with 11 years to go (I have a serious illness so want to retire early). The risks of a poorly timed downturn are clear though – been doing a lot of research on sequence risks recently. It shows it is doable though, and have to say Monevator really helps. If you’ve left it ‘too late’ to invest then it’s never too late to turn that around. Do what you can. But if it’s still not enough, then how can you make what you do have go further? Easiest way is geo arbitrage. The UK is a high cost of living location. It’s a relatively rich (but IMO still deeply dysfunctional) nation with a lot of poor people and a few rich ones. And when GDP per capita is around £35,000 p.a. then nothing is cheap and everyone wants a piece of what’s yours. So why not just up sticks altogether and move to where your money will buy you 2 to 3 times as much? If you think that you can’t do that because of your relatives/ friends/ the language barrier, then of course you can. Do it for yourself and for the life you deserve, but have been afraid to reach for. Even in Europe, there are still Low Cost of Living locations where tax is minimal and where £100k will buy you a fine house and a little over £20k p.a. will give you a decent standard of living for a couple. Check out the example of Bosnia. Totally under the radar: https://youtu.be/vxVuFFAhHsQ?feature=shared And that channel/website has plenty of other ideas too: https://thewanderinginvestor.com/blog/ As does this one here: https://youtu.be/KXf38mC3puE?feature=shared And here: https://youtu.be/ebIzq3-rDSw?feature=shared The other thing you could do is accept you’ve messed it up, put £2880 in your new borns JSIPP and at least they won’t suffer the same fate? So who do we know who has happily relocated to Bosnia? I’m highly suspicious of the geo-arbitrage is easy brigade. Like the cost of living is the only variable in quality of life. Someone would actually have to have done it in order for me to take them seriously. But in that scenario, I would be all ears! @Rhino: what about the millions of Brits who retired to Spain and Portugal since the 1970s? No longer such LCOL destinations now, for sure, but just after the fall of Salazar’s successor and the death of Franco in 1974 and 1975 respectively they very definitely were. Do you really think we just happen to be born into the best overall retirement location we could have been born into? I doubt it. Re: Geo-arbitrage, let’s not forget the more modest option of doing it semi-local, as exemplified by one of our readers: https://monevator.com/fire-side-chat-domestic-geo-arbitrage-made-it-possible/ @Ermine — Thanks for chiming in, was hoping you would! You are indeed UK personal finance’s poster-man for starting late and getting out. 🙂 Absolutely, I’d talk to one of them to get the lowdown. Funnily enough my uncle is currently moored up in Portugal semi permanently. In a similar vein to my JSIPP comment I’m trying to talk my kids into marrying Norwegians. @Delta Hedge #6 Easiest way is geo arbitrage. The UK is a high cost of living location. It’s a relatively rich (but IMO still deeply dysfunctional) nation with a lot of poor people and a few rich ones. London is a HCOL location. Fixed that for you 😉 OK, fair enough, a few other UK cities, which tend to be peopled by highish paid young professionals, Oxbridge, Bristol. Those poor people ted to reduce the COL somewhat. Avoid the extremes, natch. I’m not knocking geo-arbitrage, but it should be said that it’s harder as you get older, and while barista-FIRE sucks ending up Billy-no-mates in an alien culture where you don’t really grasp the lingo probably sucks in a different way. It’s not just your personal finances where it’s harder to change things as you get older. I have been plugging away at Duolingo French for nearly a year, while there is some progress and I am probably ahead of my O level French progress is glacial. I can sort of follow the radio news, interviews with real people still sound like line noise to me. Sometimes you gotta do the best with what you have to hand, I agree, but life is about more than money, it is also about your setting. I’m sure Bosnia is charming, but geo-arbitrage works within the UK too – and particularly within the US. There’s some argument it’s worth moving after you retire, since proximity to high-paying work and/or good transport connections to it do raise the cost of living massively. Also high population densities and work opportunities are usually detrimental to natural beauty. I agree wholeheartedly with the theory of “Do you really think we just happen to be born into the best overall retirement location we could have been born into? I doubt it.” , it’s just that in practice you are also shaped across your lifetime by where you live. Arguably the best time to deploy geo-arbitrage is in your twenties when you have least baggage. Reminds me of the book, ‘the almost nearly perfect people’ by Michael Booth. Synopsis is that the scandi countries regularly top the bill in happiness surveys and quality of life etc. but this is from the perspective of the native population, with the ex-pat experience being somewhat different and not so rosy. It’s worth a read actually. FIRE blogs also peppered with failed emigration experiments – grass is generally greener type fallacies. I get the feeling successful geo arbitrage is quite a tough one to pull off in practice, especially, as ermine notes, for those of more advanced years. Would agree, domestic geo arbitrage a much simpler trick. @ermine – I suspect that Duolingo will turn out to be the Sinclair C5 to Tesla’s Model S. What the UK’s many language barrier challenged potential geo arbitrageurs are waiting for is a fusion of Google Translate with the successor to Google Glass and the Apple Vision Pro. Imagine a fully wearable and weatherproof rechargeable device which takes spoken words and written characters in any language and translates them immediately, seamlessly and automatically into any other. And it needs to retail for below £1,000. This is far more near term likely I think than Tesla’s level 5 FSD EV ‘robotaxi’, yet alone Musk’s mad Mars’ plans. The Babel Fish of Douglas Adams’ lore may be near to hand: https://youtu.be/iuumnjJWFO4?si=0TFOkETmWgqTfHSN @Delta Hedge Imagine a fully wearable and weatherproof rechargeable device which takes spoken words and written characters in any language and translates them immediately, seamlessly and automatically into any other. No thanks. I don’t routinely carry a mobile phone with me, never mind a full-body robo-suit. All Watched Over By machines Of Loving Grace. Curtis, not Brautigan > And it needs to retail for below £1,000 Yup. For that price it’ll whisper advertising sweet nothings to you all the time, I’m sure, wraparound Facebook. A metaverse, indeed. Each to their own. I am so old I remember what the term IRL means 😉 And I read Asimov’s The Feeling of Power in my teens. You are more than welcome to say OK Boomer but if that’s the price of entry I think it illustrates the problem of geo-arbitrage for those at the RE end of the journey. @ermine: ideally it’ll all fit neatly inside a jacket pocket and comprise a) wireless ear buds with microphones to take the foreign spoken words and play it to you in English, b) glasses with LED sized cameras embedded to OCR scan foreign written words and display the English translation on the inside of the lenses and c) your mobile phone which you’ll just speak into and its speaker will then translate into the foreign language, in your own voice should you chose. It might sound far fetched but the only piece of Star Trek tech which came to pass (only more so) was the Communicator, which became the mobile phone, and now the smart phone. And on the subject of wrap around Facebook, this from Investing.com only today: “Meta climbed Wednesday after debuting its first augmented reality glasses at its annual connect event”. The future is closer than you think. As Dylan said back in day, ‘the times they are a changin’. @DH (13) I wouldn’t be too quick to knock Duolingo. I have studied German slowly and painfully the old-fashioned way over the years. I am involved in a German conversation group and have been impressed on more than one occasion by the competence of newcomers who have only learned via Duolingo. @DavidV: These investors think Duolingo could be one of the best investments out there: https://open.substack.com/pub/atmosinvest/p/top-4-favorite-stocks-to-own-forever Then again, since subscribing to the free tier for a score of investment Substacks, I’m now daily bombarded with ‘the 25 best companies to hold forever’ type lists, which if I added them up probably more or less make up the investment universe and thereby inadvertently make the case for index tracking 😉 You need to frighten people into saving for their old age. Just ask them “Do you want to reach your sixties still dependent on other people paying for your clothes?” That should do the trick. On taking on more risk, leverage + active investing, this is double edged: – Using volatility and permanent loss of capital as metrics here, moving up the risk scale from index tracking equities to say single name stocks or sectors and regional bets usually doesn’t work or more pros would do it and more retail investors would lag less. – But Consumer Staples and Low Volatility stocks as groups do benefit it seems from more return per unit of risk, defying the efficient frontier. Historically Private Equity has outperformed on this measure but that seems not to be the case now. – Leveraging a low risk asset can deliver better risk to return than moving to invest in a higher risk asset. You really need cost of carry to be low to negative – i.e. the cost of finance is less than the net (post any tax payable) paid out yield on the assets brought. – Contrarianism tends to be a fail but sometimes it wins. But you have both to be right when others are wrong and in a way where you get an additional net return. This is harder than it sounds. For every successful contrarian you do hear about there are so many more who failed who you never hear from. – Then again there are always contrarian opportunities. From the Daily Telegraph’s money pages just this morning “Had you invested £100 in an index of emerging market shares in September 2009, you would have £121 today. The same amount focused on China itself would be worth just £95. Had you instead put your faith in a global stock market recovery over the next decade and a half you would have grown your £100 to £324. And if you had simply bet that America would bounce back to regain its economic leadership, your £100 investment would today be worth £539.” And, for balance here, our own @TI in the MV piece “A buying opportunity has emerged in Emerging Markets” said (back on 11 December 2013): “The S&P 500 has beaten the iShares emerging markets ETF by more than 30% in the year to-date.Will that stellar level of outperformance continue? Maybe. Will it be replayed every year for the rest of the decade? I’ll go out on a limb and say: Not on your nelly”. Back then 11 years ago I nodded to myself in agreement with that as how could the US just keep outperforming year after year after year? But it did. In and around 2012 there were actually a couple of pieces out there saying that US tech was quite cheap compared to then recent (1995-2000 and 2004-7) historical valuations and its growth prospects. If you’d gone with that sentiment; then, from 30th December 2011 through to 3rd January 2022 (buying the NASDAQ index on the last trading day of the earlier year, and selling on the first trading day of the latter), you would have made 19.79% annually in dollar terms, and more still in sterling. So, being a contrarian (in that example case, a tech uber bull) can pay off, it’s just statistically that it tends not to at the aggregate level. @ermine (#3) “For the love of God, if you must eat pet food in your dotage, go with dog food, not cat food. Have you seen what they put in cat food?” Why pet food at all? Even buying in bulk, the dog food we get (just to be completely clear – for our dog) is just over a £1 a tin, whereas Aldi baked beans are 41p, tinned soups 61p, and a jacket potato 24p. OK, Aldi’s dog food is a bit cheaper than what we buy (~50p in multipacks), but our dog’s innards have become a bit fussy as he has aged. Not wanting to take away from your point about jumping ship to a better paid job, but I’m not convinced that the poor public sector, prosperous private sector schtick is still true. Thanks to outsourcing the line between the two has become very murky. The people delivering services are often agency staff while the office staff are permies on gold plated DB pensions. To boost your pension it might make more sense to move from private to public. RE: Emerging markets versus the US, oof, yes, but I’d take that side again. Especially as I didn’t forecast the US market wouldn’t beat EM, I just didn’t think it’d continue to thrash it. Which was wrong, but rational — then and now I’d argue. I’ve mentioned before that I published elsewhere on the Internet in 2011 or 2012 a two-part series on why investors shouldn’t write-off the US stock market, especially tech shares. It is a massive ongoing gripe for me that these articles (along with most others on that site) are no longer available. Not just for bragging rights (though there is that) but because I’d love to link to it to show that — hard as it is to believe theser days — there was a time when the mighty US market was out of fashion, and it wasn’t even that long ago! I look at markets today and I too struggle to see the tech-lite Rest of World keeping up with US exceptionalism. But then I struggle even more to imagine another near-15 year winning streak for the US. Doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen of course — there are underlying reasons why the US has done so well, especially in tech — but as we’ve discussed before there’s usually a medium-term Ying and Yang to US versus the rest of the world’s equities (albeit with the US outpacing the field long-term). Re: DuoLingo, another shareholder here! I have a small position that’s better than doubled and every week I chant the name ‘Bessembinder ‘ three times and will myself to hold onto it. 😉 Nice new interview with the CEO here: https://sherwood.news/business/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-q-and-a/ @Azamino – You could well be right — as I alluded to in the article I can hardly get into even broad brush discussions for earning potential in different industry sectors, let along people’s specific careers. I think your helpful comment reinforces that people looking to catch-up need to take a holistic view of what they’re trying to achieve with their pension, and what the best opportunities are for *them* specifically. 🙂 @TI “…I published elsewhere on the Internet in 2011 or 2012 a two-part series on why investors shouldn’t write-off the US stock market, especially tech shares. It is a massive ongoing gripe for me that these articles (along with most others on that site) are no longer available.” Have you tried the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/)? I find that site extremely useful for finding deleted material (or deleted domains). @DH accepting that one shouldn’t always infer the general from the particular, I am disturbed both by the capacity for AI to bullshit on all cylinders along with the tendency for AI fans to believe in its ability to transform the world. I have an installation of BirdnetPi in my back garden. It’s quite successfuly identified that there are birds in the garden, it has achieved 100% fail, confidently (> 80%) IDing this exotic crew, I’d have twitchers on the lawn by now 😉 I have put the real IDs in brackets, formed from listening to the recordings AI used to identify: Northern Slaty-Antshrike (robin alarm) Lark-like Bunting (robin alarm) Common Poorwill (some finch followed by magpie) Lark-like Bunting (robin song) Indian Roller (jackdaw) Two things are wrong here. One is these are acceptably clear recordings, some finch is my lack of detailed knowledge but the others are certs. This damn thing knows the lat/lon of where it lives, if I went to a pub with a bunch of people who had the slightest knowledge I’d be laughed out the door claiming the original list. I haven’t got the faintest idea of what Tensorflow Lite is which seems to be the AI guts of this, but the breathtaking confidence in total error is quite impressive, particularly given prior knowledge. I will piddle with this to see if it can be sharpened up, but the fundamental Dunning-Kruger problem is one I’ve seen in a lot of AI. It’s there in the AI ‘assistance’ Wordpress offers, which can totally change the meaning of a sentence with blithe assurance this is better. I used perplexity to try and see if two electric blanket controllers were equivalent. It hemmed and hawed, I read a page of random waffle and was none the wiser; its greatest service was locating a picture of the connectors from which I inferred it was worth a go, and it worked. So apart from the Isaac Asimov angle, I’ll stick with Duolingo, because from these experiences I infer using an AI babelfish is probably a great way to hurl vile abuse at random strangers in foreign countries, which you won’t realise until you get your face rearranged or a pantechnicon arrived with three tons of rice pudding when you thought you ordered a couple of bags of sugar. There’s a fundamental problem with whizzy tools in the hands of noobs. If you have at least some idea of what the result should look like, you have some change of switching it off if it’s chuntering out gibberish. I’m sure people will fix some of this in time, but in the meantime, emigrants/expats/whatever, learn the lingo to at least a serviceable degree. Similarly for the culture- if you are going to some Arab countries then cover up and lay off the hooch, in Thailand don’t insult the king etc etc. @Curlew — Yes, curiously the whole URL hasn’t been archived, which is odd because it wasn’t a small website. I wonder if the site’s owner somehow barred their site from being archived legally or via robots.txt or something. We’d also have the issue of my ‘coming out’ (which if it ever happens will be the biggest anti-climax since the Segway, but which I’d rather do deliberately versus a random link). Moot anyway as the link’s not there. :-\ @ermine: buggy AI is going to be a much bigger issue to begin with than the “Open the pod bay doors HAL” scenario and, even if and when that scenario arrives, it’s then bad human actors misusing AI that’ll be the bigger risk, and not the creation of a SkyNet. At the moment both chat bots and LLM assisted search are pretty crappy tbh. OTOH, there’s some impressive stuff going on with protein folding and with combining neural nets and LLMs. Google Deep Mind was able to crack International Maths Olympiad problems for example and win silver. Already some firms are firing human coders for machine written software. However, it’s not where things are now, but where they will be, that really matters. It’s overhyped now for sure, but writing off machine learning today would be like saying that the internet was going nowhere commercially in 1994. I suspect that there’s a big market for usable, portable, real time translate. It just has to integrate seamlessly with existing (mobile phone) and future (Meta / Apple / Google glasses and ear buds) consumer tech. @TI: I’ve got a feeling now that yours may be the articles which I was referring to above (“around 2012 there were actually a couple of pieces out there saying that US tech was quite cheap”)! Cheap growth beats cheap value and even cheap quality IMO. So you were prescient. EM and European underperformance is rather perplexing. EMs got bid up in the run up to 2008, but they had already taken a massive pummeling by 2013. Likewise, Europe was in the doldrums from the Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain (the ‘PIGS’) debt crisis, and Cyprus was in the frame. Those markets didn’t exactly look overvalued back then, and they really should have put in a much better performance from 2014 to date. It’s not just relative underperformance to the US generally and American Mega Cap Tech particularly, but a rather poor absolute level of return, especially from China. Small caps and small value has also underperformed by a historically unusual margin, and over an exceptionally long time frame. I don’t give financial advice. If (and thank God I’m not in this position) I were to be a late starter to investment then, for me, I guess that I’d be thinking then about taking more concentration risk and a contrarian active bet on mean reversion. That strategy could, of course, easily blow up. But if, counterfactually, I was to find myself that far behind and with so little time left until I expected to retired, then I suspect that I’d then feel compelled to try something radical. That’s not the best way to invest as fear and desperation cloud judgment as much as greed and hubris. @Alan S #20 I wasn’t advocating eating pet food – there was a novel Monevator once recommended that had ‘the dog food years’. It’s more TA we need to worry about, he used to favour dog food in times of fiscal distress but I fear he has a darker view of the financial future since he has cited eating cat food as the marker of epic fail in a portfolio 😉 @DeltaHedge #26 But if, counterfactually, I was to find myself that far behind and with so little time left until I expected to retired, then I suspect that I’d then feel compelled to try something radical. That’s not the best way to invest as fear and desperation cloud judgment as much as greed and hubris. Worked for me 😉 I read this dark transmission on here and at the end of that month had a meeting with a line manager and saw the writing on the wall. I was not the Right Stuff and was wasn’t prepared to do what was necessary to become it. Had I know that line manager was desperate because he had a new baby with his new second wife I would have used that against him, it explained the intensity of the discussion since he needed bodies. Later line managers were puzzled as to exactly why I inferred a one-way ticket. But once you emotionally decide the only way out is to pull the big red ejector handle, you can’t stop the hand reaching for that sucker. I exited the middle class and lived on almost minimum wage for three years, a damn sight eaiser if you own your house with a vestigial mortgage. The difference not spent attracted 40%/32% tax win which is more than that percentage on the amount foregone. It’s not the greatest amount of fun I’ve ever had. But as we observed in a Skype call with some ex-Imperial guys, the privilege of owning your own time and deciding what you will do with this day never gets old, even after a decade. Never underestimate the financial firepower of a desperate old git in the endgame at the peak of his earning power. I have been cynical about the value of compound interest, yes, I’ve seen it but only a decade after retiring. CI plus passive investment expected returns is ion drive, not Saturn V. I did have luck on my side inasmuch as the reason my job went bad was partly because the markets had been shot up in the global financial crisis. That is a terribly good time to start investing, market timing with knobs on. You didn’t have to get much right then, but you did need to start, and I did. I didn’t really expect it to work, but I could recognise a chance worth taking Your FIRE journey was an inspiration to us all @ermine 🙂 Ion drives beat chemical rockets every time. Investing Saturn V’s can blow up on the launch pad like Putin’s recent failed Sarmat ICBM test. Late to the game invesors who are looking to try and play catch up before their retirement beckons should first check out the outcome of the 1969-70 Australian mining bubble or the fate of once all conquering, and much pumped and dumped, alt-coins like Verge/XVG, whose rollercoaster ride Coindesk summaries thus: “On Dec. 23, 2017, the coin hit highs of 30 cents, a staggering 1,384,300% increase from its all-time low…on Feb. 5, 2015. In the wake of the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019, the coin fell to as low as just under 1 cent in March 2020. It wasn’t until 2021, when Bitcoin skyrocketed again, that XVG reached 6 cents in May. The crypto market crashed shortly after… The coin never fully recovered, and by June 2022 had fallen to $0.004. Yet, even that low price marks a staggering 188,149% increase from XVG’s all-time low of $0.000002 on Feb. 5, 2015.” It’s still at $0.004 today, now nearly 7 years on from, and 98.7% down from, its 2017 peak. And in the crypto winter of 2018-19 it was actually at one point down 99.4% from the All Time Highs. It was at that peak that it first attracted attention and then drew in the newbies, as if attracted to a naked flame. The results thereafter were all too predictable, and indeed predicted at the time. I visited a beet sugar refinery once and discovered a fact that took my interest. What do you think they do with the protein from the beets? Goldfish food! Bugger cat or dog food, eat vegan goldfish food. [Correction: Spotted that Coindesk have messed up their maths. The lowest (2015) XVG price was actually $0.00002167 (so they’ve erroneously added an extra 0), which in turn means that the 188,149% figure should be 18,814.9%. The cycle low is $0.001427, which is more than 99.4% off the ATH, which elsewhere is more accurately given as $0.29725. The point remains, crypto is nuts, and alt-coins are a no touch for most (/sensible) investors]. Great article as always 🙂 I started actively investing when I was around 45, after taking a closer look at my work pension and then wondering what I was going to when I retire and it looked scary to me. I started with increasing my pension contributions and sorted out my monthly budget, which then started me looking at ISAs & passive investing with the help of this great blog and a more active portfolio using Investment Trusts. I’m 51 now with no debt other than what’s left of my Mortgage, I can at least see a path now and feel a lot more confident in taking a little more risk I still think I’ll be working when I’m 63 ish I think with a view to working part time. Hopefully by then I’ll have paid off the house When I see examples like the Captain Sensible one I kick myself for having missed out. Then I remember that I did do some moderately stashing of things away around about 29-30 but the problem was gains were eaten up by crap adviser charges (I think you had to go with a broker to buy a S&S PEP at the time) and mediocre funds so got nothing like the 8% example. Plus life was happening so I didn’t do it consistently and did the usual getting spooked by poor sequence of returns when it came to putting more in. The folly of yoof and all that. Only in my more reccent & more focused years been able to access almost nil cost platforms and the real low OCF funds/ETFs to plump up returns and really get past the worry aspect. Only started seriously investing late in day, unfortunately, a few years ago due to getting fingers burnt some 30 -40 years ago so consequently put me off Long story but medical conditions forced me to finish work early around 50 – had started in my earlier 40’s I think many people over estimate what they’ll need, how well they are likely to be – regardless of any healthy lifestyle and how long they’ve got left – which is likely better than not enough but puts you under major stress at times, many think they’ll be running around at 90 or 100 when actually not that many are – and if still alive certainly not spending much (unless paying for your care home costs) or getting out much. Holidays/cars likely a distant memory – that’s if you still have a memory at all I know they are investing focussed but many finance blogs I have read on this subject make light of, and seem to suggest, an early death is quite the advantage in that the portfolio won’t run out (regardless of withdrawal rate) Once you are faced with that prospect I can assure you that your pot isn’t your main concern and you would much rather live longer with not so much rather than vice versa As some others said I don’t find geo arbitrage (or in plain english “moving to somewhere cheaper to live”) always much of a good option either for most -tends to be those in later life or at least middle aged that would consider it and more often those looking to do an “escape to the country” type thing as generally by then had enough of cities and prefer a quieter existence But this is also when medical conditions tend to crop up, as mine and many others I know did – then you need to have medical facilities/main hospitals with A&E at hand Not always a period of your life when you want to be uprooting to miles away – which can often be the case if you require a large decrease in property costs – and having to start again, maybe no family around Also you can only achieve a large saving on property cost if you are already living in a fairly highly priced area but if you live in north then good luck with making much from that (unless you are also downsizing by a lot) I’ve known many come back as well after moving to Aus/NZ/other parts of UK – as the grass is not always greener as they believed it was – especially if you don’t really know anybody there Also when older you tend to delight in moving house with all it’s hassle and ramifications about as much as going to Glastonbury every year I agree with others divorce is a big risk and sometimes don’t even have to be married – the number of people suggesting to invest monies in partner’s ISA/pension if used all your allowances to save tax seems quite ludicrous to me, no matter how safe you think your relationship is – people can change markedly over time and even the safest can and do go sour. Also what about if they die first and not married and maybe no will – that would go to their family – not to you but some do it – presumably think it won’t happen to them – is that the “not me gov” bias? ^ @dearieme 30 Was it Wissington Sugar Factory? Great article. One piece of advice is focus on where you are investing as much as how much do you put into a pension. Too many workplace pensions have a ‘default’ allocation which typically are not the best for performance. Invest passively, diversity your portfolio, keep charges low and that should put you in good stead. Don’t try to chase todays winners (which are tomorrows losers). To get rich quick you do it slowly…. I retired at 60 with way more money than I needed but still enjoyed part time consulting for the first five years of retirement. I was able to earn six figures working only about 8 hours a week. But I also watched other engineers fail at consulting and it was easy to see why. Many engineers move into our management functions later in their careers. And their technical skills atrophy or become outdated. Even though I ran a billion dollar corporation I still kept a couple of tech responsibilities that kept my engineering skills sharp and current. If you plan on consulting after retirement that is a must. I was certainly late to investing, not starting until after I’d retired. This was an easy option as I’d joined the Civil Service as a graduate, partly because of the job for life, plus the “non-contributory” pension then advertised. As a middle manager I was lucky to spend most of my career doing roles I was competent at and interested in and looked forward to that decent pension without worrying about retirement. Rather than invest, we just bought properties we could do up in turn, concentrate on getting our garden just as we wanted it, before moving onto the next one for a yet larger garden. However, the anticipated pension prospects shrunk as the post financial crash curbs on public sector pay persisted. Then the coalition government decided we should pay more for our “non-contributory” pension, up to 8% of salary, an amount that simply swelled Treasury coffers as there’s no actual fund for such money. Taking into account the annual season ticket, I found my net pay after that going down. Even now, the published gross salary for my former grade isn’t much above where I finished up. Luckily for me, the coalition government was looking ditch many of my grade and I took the plunge in 2012. The mortgage remaining was quite sizeable but we’d already decided to sell up and shift to southern Scotland, less downsizing, more “down-financing”. Same size property, but half size garden. Domestic geo arbitrage in action. Initially I ignored investing as my one previous toe in the water was a small PEP invested in Euro stocks in 1999, which just went sideways for years. Only later, once interest rates started to go right down and peer-to-peer start to look riskier did I consider the stock market, inching in via Fundsmith and Vanguard VUSA in 2018. Just before COVID I discovered Monevator and received the “Don’t f***ing sell” message just before my early gains disappeared. But I hung on in there. Since then, with the help of TI and TA, I’ve diligently continued to accumulate my growing snowball, with my partner’s very successful passive portfolio and my much more interesting but perhaps less lucrative mainly active portfolio. I’m grateful not to be someone who relies on the success of their investing, but can instead develop it as a hobby to pay for improving our latest abode, develop our latest garden and cover our holidays. I’ve made my share of mistakes and learned an awful lot in six years, but hopefully there’s no prospect of being reduced to cat food (or indeed cats) while the UK manages to avoid true economic disaster. Thanks then to Monevator. While I may not merit Mogul status, you certainly well deserve my Mogul sub. @lenahan35. A definite maybe: it was in East Anglia but I’m not sure it was that one. It could have been Bury St Edmunds but that’s a maybe too. It was decades ago and my memory is unclear but I do remember putting my hand into a bin of product, sniffing it, and being instantly transported back to boyhood. (Like wot that French cove wrote about searching for his lost cat. If you’ll forgive a boyish joke.) As an exercise in squeezing value out of almost every stream of material in the plant the whole thing was mighty impressive. @No Longer Civil — Thanks for sharing your experiences and even more so for taking out a Moguls subscription. Hope you enjoy many happy years of tending to your garden and your portfolio! 🙂 @Jon and others — Just a quick thanks to everyone who shared their experiences of starting late with investing (and please do add yours if you’ve not already). Some Monevator pages are still widely-read years after publication. And hopefully these comments will provide some inspiration to anyone desperately Googling for a way to turn things around in the afternoon of their careers! I was interested to see the several comments about divorce. Back in my older and bolshier days I drafted a post about why you should not get married, but like a similar one on the real cost of having kids I shelved it. Perhaps I should see if it might be salvaged… 😉 Also, lots of interesting detail there in your comment in particular @Jon. Could I interest you in doing a FIRE-side chat interview?

Title: Could The Newly Launched Bitcoin ETF Options Propel BTC Price To The Moon? Bitwise’s Exec Thinks So

Full Content:
One of the exciting developments from last Friday was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) greenlight for listing and trading of physically settled options tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitwise’s head of alpha strategies has suggested that these products could set the stage for enormous upside volatility in the BTC price. On Sept. 20, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its regulatory blessing to the Nasdaq exchange to list options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) — marking the first time the top Wall Street financial cop has greenlighted options tied to spot Bitcoin funds for U.S. customers. Listing spot BTC options on regulated US exchanges, where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects traders against counterparty risk, represents “the most monumental advancement possible” for cryptocurrency markets, Jeff Park, Bitwise Asset Management’s head of alpha strategies, observed in a Friday tweet. “For the first time, Bitcoin will have a regulated market where the OCC protects clearing members from counterparty risks,” Park explained. “This means Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure can grow exponentially without the [default] risks that have kept investors at bay.” Notably, Park argued that Bitcoin’s unique attributes combined with options could deliver massive potential for upside volatility. The first is Bitcoin’s “volatility smile,” depicting the willingness of derivatives traders to pay high premiums for both exposure to and protection from heavy upside or downside price volatility. This gives Bitcoin options “negative Vanna,” meaning the asset’s volatility soars alongside its spot price, making Bitcoin’s upside “explosively recursive.” “A negative Vanna gamma squeeze acts like a refueling rocket,” the expert added. The other Bitcoin characteristic is its capped supply. As fresh leverage flows into the market, new coins cannot be printed to accommodate it — an anomaly that has typically limited the peak of explosive meme stocks such as Gamestop (GME). While there are markets for other commodities like oil and natural gas, the Bitwise executive said they trade more closely with the futures market because they have expiration dates. They’re also vulnerable to supply manipulation by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other bodies.“Bitcoin ETF options are the first time the financial world will see regulated leverage on a perpetual commodity that is truly supply constrained,” he summarized. “Things will likely get wild. In such scenarios, regulated markets may shut down.” Remarkably, Bitcoin is completely decentralized and can’t be shut down, which he believes “will add even more fuel to the fire.” “It’s going to be unbelievably fantastic.” Meanwhile, other top analysts expect the SEC to approve options trading on other spot Bitcoin ETFs “in short order.”

By: Temidayo Omoniyi | Updated: 2024-09-25 | Comments | Related: > Cloud Strategy With the ever-growing demand for data to power Large Language models (LLM), the need for streaming data is on the rise. The influx of data coming in real-time needs to be stored and made useful for prediction or descriptive use cases. Microsoft Azure has tools to achieve this use case with its many resources for data professionals. We can achieve predictive and descriptive models by introducing resources like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, and Power BI services. To better understand this article, it is advised to read the previous article titled "Data Streaming Micro-Service Architecture with Azure Technology". This article is a continuation, with a few resources being provisioned. Project Architecture Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is a cloud-based service designed to process and analyze large volumes of data from a variety of sources, including applications, social media feeds, and sensors, in real-time. The following steps should be taken to provide an Azures Stream Analytics job. Step 1: Basic Settings. In your Azure portal, fill in the following information, as seen in the image below. Step 2: Storage Account (Optional). This is optional. You can add a storage account to Azure Stream Analytics by setting up your container in Azure Data Lake. This is also used to sort the ingested data in real-time in the Azure storage account. Leave all other settings at default and click Review + create to provision the Azure Stream Analytics Job. Now that we have successfully provisioned the Azure Stream Analytics Job, we need to read and analyze the data. Set Input. This refers to the source at which the data will be ingested in Azure Stream Analytics. This is obtained from Azure Event Hub. From Azure Stream Analytics, expand Job topology, then select Inputs. This should open a new window, where you click Add input and select Event Hub. In the new window, fill in the following from the image below and click Save. Note: Leave the rest at default. Test Input Connection. After successfully creating the Azure Event Hub input, test the connection by clicking the test connection icon (not shown). If all is done appropriately, you should receive a Successful connection test message. Set Output. From the Project Architecture, we plan to move aggregated data from Azure Stream Analytics to the Power BI Streaming Dataset. The next steps should be followed to achieve the output dataset: Step 1: Create Power BI Workspace. A workspace is a collaborative area containing datasets (semantic models), reports, dashboards, etc., where colleagues develop and share business intelligence reports. You can learn more about the Power BI Service workspace by reading one of our previous articles. In your Power BI Service, click on Workspaces and select New | Workspace. This should open a new window where you need to fill in the following information and click Apply. Step 2: Assign Stream Analytic Output to Power BI Workspace. Now that you have created the Power BI workspace, head back to your Azure Stream Analytics in your Stream Analytics. In your Stream Analytics, select Outputs, Add Output, and choose Power BI. In the new window, fill in the following information from the image below. Click Save. Step 3: Query Stream Data. In your Stream Analytics, click on Query. This will open a new window where you are expected to fill in the following. From the query below, you will notice the data is being read from Stream Analytics and pushed into the Power BI workspace streamyahoofinance we created earlier. If you are satisfied with the query, start the Stream Analytics job by clicking the Start job button. This automatically starts Steam Analytics and pushes the data to the Power BI Service dataset. Now that your Stream Analytics job is running, head to the Power BI Service workspace created to confirm the dataset. If you notice the dataset is not appearing, try refreshing the web browser and run again. In your Semantic model, click the 3 dots and select Create report. This will open Power BI Design Canvas. In Power BI Report Canvas, you can create simple reports of your choice. The report below might have a limited amount of insight because it was done on a weekend when most stock markets are closed for the week. Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web-based development environment for data professionals for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure Platform. The following steps should be taken to create Azure Machine Learning. Step 1: Basic Configuration. In your Azure Portal, search for Azure ML Studio and fill in the necessary settings. Click Review + create. Step 2: Launch Studio. After successfully provisioning Azure ML Studio, click Launch studio to start building your models. Step 3: Create Compute. Azure ML Compute refers to the computing resources you use to run your machine learning projects in Azure Machine Learning. These resources provide the processing power and memory needed to train your models, analyze data, and deploy them into production. There are different types of computing available in Azure Machine Learning. For this article, we will focus on the Compute Instance and Compute Cluster, their differences, and when best to use them. Create the Compute Instance: You can manually stop the cluster if you are not using it or set it to off after a certain inactive period. During real-world scenarios, it is best to develop your model in a test environment and then import it to Azure Machine Learning. This is for cost-saving purposes and other use cases. We will use the Jupyter Notebook to test and deploy the base to Azure ML for production use cases. The following steps will help to create a forecast model from Yahoo Finance: Step 1: Install All Necessary Libraries. Before starting the process, we need to install all necessary libraries for this project. Open your Windows terminal and paste the script below to install all the required Python Wheels. Step 2: Import All Needed Libraries. Here is a list of imported libraries needed for this project. Step 3: Get Historical Data. Note:Since we want to create a forecast model, we need historical data to train the model for prediction purposes. Data ingested from Yahoo Finance API with the Azure Function Timer trigger are in real-time; this means we don't have enough historical data to create a predictive model. Create a function that will help get the Nvidia stock data from the start date of 2010-01-01 till current date. This date range would provide enough historical data to train the model. Step 4: Visualization. Using the matplotlib library, we will create a line chart to provide a trend to understand the closing price of NVDA stock over the past couple of years. Step 5: Filter Closing Price Column. We need to create a new DataFrame with only the Close column. We plan to create a forecast model based on the Closing price column. Step 6: Standardize the Data. Scaling the data using the MinMaxScaler function is a method to slice the data to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. The MinMaxScaler is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module. Step 7: Split Data to Train. Splitting the data will help prepare the training data for the machine learning model, specifically for our case, which is a time series prediction. Step 8: Convert x_train and y_train to Numpy Array. We need to convert the training data list into a numpy array and reshape the input data into the needed format for the forecast machine learning model, which is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Step 9: Create Model. Using the LSTM model for time prediction, the following lines of code are used in creating the needed model: The following specifies the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset using the epoch number. Step 10: Split Data to Test. The code snippet below is used to split the data into both the x_test and y_test needed for the forecast model. Step 11: Create a Forecast Chart. With all the necessary information, we can create a forecast chart using the historical data. Looking at the image below, you will notice that the Predicted Trend and Validation trend are close to the train forecast. We can further improve the model's accuracy by performing hyper-parameter and model tuning. Now that we are satisfied with the model, we can import it to Azure Machine Learning. In your Azure Machine Learning Notebook tab, click the 3 dots (not shown), and then select Upload files. This will open another window. In the new window, click the + icon to upload the .ipynb file from your local machine, check all the boxes, and click Upload. With the file successfully uploaded, we can save the notebook, install all necessary libraries, and run the model. In this article, we have covered both descriptive and predictive models based on streaming data. We created a Power BI service workspace to ingest financial data from Yahoo Finance into the Power BI Stream Dataset Semantic model. The same process was repeated for the predictive model, where we created a model to forecast price prediction based on historical data. For the Forecast model, we could not use it in real-time as we needed historical data to first train the model before creating predictions. Subsequent articles on this project will be released to make further improvements to the predictive model.

Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 This Future of TV Briefing covers the latest in streaming and TV for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at how Overtime and Vox Media are adapting their podcasts into long-form videos. Honestly, I thought video podcasts were just a fad. And obviously, I was wrong. Way wrong. More than 170 million people have watched a video podcast on Spotify, per the company, and YouTube has become the “most used” platform for consuming podcasts, according to a study by Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights. All of which is to say: Podcasts are becoming largely video productions. As a result, podcast publishers are having to sort out how to adapt podcasts into videos. Sure, they can just hook up a show’s RSS feed to YouTube and have the audio play over a static image of the podcast’s thumbnail image. But then that’s not really a video podcast. “There is a version of a video show that you could do, say, on YouTube that is a static image and just a long-form audio bed underneath it. That doesn’t feel as native to the platform, even though people do consume that way. And so as we think about podcasts as like a modern talk show – our chat podcasts at least – we are thinking about what’s native to the different platforms where they appear,” said Nishat Kurwa, svp and executive producer for podcasts at Vox Media, which has been producing video podcasts since The Verge’s Vergecast debuted in November 2011. Making video podcasts native to platforms like YouTube means making sure a video podcast is as much a video as a podcast. There are some basic elements, like filming the hosts and guests. But simply recording a Zoom session or setting up a single camera in a podcast studio doesn’t necessarily suffice. “It’s important for us to be cutting and changing the layout of the screen, just to keep the user engaged. That’s one thing that you never need to think about for audio, vs. on video, it’s like, ‘How is there some type of change every once in a while so that people are not just looking at the same type of image for too long?’” said Sam Gordon, editor-in-chief of Overtime, which started producing long-form video podcasts roughly six months ago and has accumulated 55 million views on YouTube for those podcasts in the past two months. Much of the answer to that question depends on how the podcast is recorded. If done entirely in person, then a best practice is to set up three cameras on set: one focused on the host, one focused on the guest(s) or cohost and one set at a wide angle to show all parties. “That way we always have two angles that we can pull from for any given person,” said Gordon. In-person recordings also open up production design opportunities to create visual interest on the set. For example, Sue Bird’s and Megan Rapinoe’s podcast with Vox Media, “A Touch More,” originated as an Instagram Live series recorded at home. So the video podcast is filmed in one of Vox Media’s studios on a set “that looks like a cozy room,” said Kurwa. If recorded remotely via Zoom or another video conferencing platform, creating visual interest can be trickier. Webcam-quality clips are often of lower resolution than what people are accustomed to watching on YouTube, especially as more of YouTube’s watch time takes place on TV screens. This is where graphics become the unsung workhorse of the video podcast. “You can add a lot of personality with graphics,” said Kurwa. Overtime, for example, has graphics packages for each of its shows recorded via Zoom. These graphics enable the Zoom recordings to be inset as opposed to scaled up to cover the entire screen and enlarge the lower image quality. Additionally, Overtime sometimes adds motion to the graphics that add depth and life to the shot. “We also have graphics where we can show multiple camera angles at once. If you go full screen, and it’s half one [clip] and half the other, it’s not visually engaging,” Gordon said. Vox Media similarly enlists its design team to create custom visuals and motion graphics for its video podcasts. “We map out what the segments are going to be in the show. We talk to the design team about some recurring templates that we think we’re going to use, whether that’s the segment title cards or recurring motion graphics that we think will be useful to have over time,” Kurwa said. Minding the visual as well as aural quality of podcasts is also reshaping the skillsets of those working on podcasts. Case in point: Production assistants on the Vox Media Podcast Network’s production team have historically been responsible for pulling archival audio clips and now are being asked to also pull b-roll video clips. “We are seeing the future of podcasts as multi-platform shows. I think that is a skillset that’s really beneficial for podcast producers to have, so that they can be more versatile in the jobs of now, the jobs of the future, and be more of an asset to more kinds of productions,” Kurwa said. “It’s: Speak out, but don’t speak out if you want to pay your rent, but speak out if you want to be a morally accepted creator, but don’t speak out if you want to be able to pay your bills.” Thanks to the Summer Olympics airing across traditional TV and streaming, people spent more time watching NBCUniversal properties on their TV screens in August than any other media company’s, according to Nielsen’s latest Media Distributor Gauge viewership report. NBCUniversal’s upswing didn’t necessarily come at a cost to all other companies’ watch time shares. YouTube and Roku’s The Roku Channel gained share in the month. 90%: Percentage share of Paramount Global’s planned layoffs that the company expects to have been completed after Tuesday. $100: Price of Roku’s new Ultra connected TV device.

YouTube’s latest brand safety snafu: Ads for brands including Adobe and Mazda as well as Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign appeared on YouTube videos spreading misinformation about Haitian migrants, according to The New York Times. Lionsgate’s AI deal: The movie and TV studio has signed a deal with generative AI company Runway that gives the latter access to its content library and the former access to an AI model trained on that content, seemingly without any money changing hands between the two, according to The Wall Street Journal. YouTube’s AI tools: A year after unveiling generative AI tools for creators, YouTube is adding to its lineup by formally rolling out products to let creators have generative AI come up with video concepts and even create actual videos (albeit only up to 6-second-long clips), according to The Verge. Amazon’s AI ads: Like Google and Meta before it, Amazon has created a tool for advertisers to have AI create their video ads by converting static images into video, according to TechCrunch.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM)’s Geopolitical Risks Could Weigh on Shares

We recently published a list of 10 Best Foreign Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other best foreign stocks to buy now. The close of 2024 is resulting in a much needed paradigm shift for US and global equities. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic disrupted our way of living in 2020, investors have had to deal with one setback or another. While the immediate effect of the pandemic equities saw technology stocks soar, other sectors, such as energy and travel didn’t. Then, inflation rose in 2022 forcing central banks worldwide to rapidly hike interest rates, which naturally made equities much less attractive than before. Since then, rates have been high in Europe and the US as well as in the developing world. However, with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) and Bank of England’s (BOE) latest rate cut decision, things appear to be changing. The ECB got the ball rolling in June after it cut interest rates by 25 basis points and then followed up with another 25 point cut in September. These decisions have been influenced to some extent by economic growth concerns. During the press conference after she announced the rate cuts, ECB President Christine Lagarde commented that while her organization had initially expected European economic growth to pick up, this hadn’t been the case. As per Lagarde, “We have revised downwards the outlook for growth, because the consumption that we had anticipated for now, essentially, because net income has begun to increase, inflation has gone down significantly and we were expecting consumption to pick up, has not picked up. And I think that we will be looking at that carefully when we produce our next growth and GDP numbers.” During Q2 2024, the EU and broader Euro area’s GDP grew sequentially by 0.3%, which was similar to the Q1 figures. On an annual basis, the EU’s GDP marked a 0.8% growth while the Euro area’s growth was 0.6%. Lagarde’s comments were accompanied by the ECB’s updated growth estimates for 2024, 2025, and 2026. While it had expected these to sit at 0.9%, 1.4%, and 1.6%, respectively, the updated estimates reduced all of these by 0.1 percentage point. With the EU’s economic performance, one country’s under performance is relevant for the broader area as well as an analysis of foreign or exUSA economies. This country is Europe’s largest economy, Germany. The German economy was 2023’s worst performer among major economies as it contracted by 0.3%. In Q2, the GDP contracted by 0.1% sequentially and missed analyst estimates of 0.1%. This slowdown came at a time when inflation jumped by 2.6% in July and accelerated by 0.1 percentage point over June. The economic uncertainty has also affected German investors, as data from the ZEW economic research institute’s economic sentiment index shows that the index fell to a whopping 3.6 points from an earlier 19.2 points. Analysts had expected it to sit at 17 points. Additionally, investor perceptions of the economy fell to levels last seen just as the coronavirus had started to wreak havoc in May 2020 and sat at -84.5. Germany is struggling because the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has cut its supply of cheap Russian gas. While this has increased costs, on the demand side, Germany is suffering from a weak Chinese economy. Data from the Federal Statistical Office shows that Germany’s exports to China in May sat at €7.5 billion for a 14% annual drop. Between January to May, the exports were €40.3 billion, for a 10%+ drop over 2022. With German firms such as LVMH experiencing a 14% Chinese sales drop in Q2 and Swatch witnessing a 30% drop in H1, it’s clear that Chinese consumers are in no mood for discretionary spending. This has also led to Goldman recommending that investors sell European stocks with Chinese exposure as it is worried about its basket of European stocks. As per the bank, while “a great deal of earnings downgrades have already occurred year-to-date for our luxury basket, we worry that more could take place.” It adds that “Also, the valuation premium of the basket has deflated, but remains on the high side of its history.” Pessimism about China is evident in the data as well. During Q2, the economy grew by 4.7%, with retail sales whimpering through a 2% growth rate. This was the slowest since December 2022, when the Zero COVID lock downs were still making their impact across the country. In the aftermath of the disappointing data from the world’s second largest economy, Goldman and Citi, which had earlier expected the Chinese economy to grow by 4.9% and 4.8%, slashed their estimates to 4.7%. Goldman commented “We believe the risk that China will miss the ‘around 5%’ full-year GDP growth target is on the rise, and thus the urgency for more demand-side easing measures is also increasing,” while Citi stated, “We believe fiscal policy needs to step up to so as to break the austerity trap and timely deploy growth support.” Yet, while Germany and China have struggled, the world’s largest economy America has thrived. US GDP grew by 3.1% annually in Q2, lending credence to the argument of American exceptionalism. On a quarterly basis, it was up by 0.7%, despite the fact that interest rates remain at a 24 year high. This growth has created ample room for the Federal Reserve to keep rates high, and now, most expect that an interest rate cut is incoming. Due to America’s dominant role in global economic affairs, the Fed’s decisions have a global impact. For European stocks, it meant that the day before the rate cut decision, the index tracking Europe’s top 600 stocks gained 0.5% while the British stock market jumped by 0.7%. Our Methodology To make our list of the best foreign stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 most valuable exUS stocks in terms of market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q2 2024. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen. Care was taken to ensure that stocks that were founded in America but are headquartered in Ireland or other jurisdictions were eliminated. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 156 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer which provides it with a wide moat in the industry. Some of its biggest and most lucrative customers include tech companies like Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and AMD. Since chip designing is a complex process that takes years of development, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) benefits from long term customer partnerships. It also leads its primary rival Samsung when it comes to product quality which ensures that all of the world’s biggest companies continue to rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) to manufacture their chips. The firm is also currently competing with beleaguered US chip giant Intel, which plans to produce its 18A process in 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) might see competition from Intel some years down the road if the latter can ramp up its products, and the only worries surrounding the firm is its operations base in Taiwan which is vulnerable to conflict with China. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said: “However, we added to our semiconductor positioning during the quarter with the purchase of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). TSM, an out-of-benchmark name, is the world’s fabrication production provider of choice. The criticality and sophistication of the company’s manufacturing footprint powers all of the leading edge fabless global semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom. While AI has driven upside in data centers, PCs and handsets are at cycle lows, positioning half of the company’s business for a recovery.” Overall TSM ranks 1st on our list of best foreign stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

CrowdStrike’s senior vice-president for counter adversary operations, Adam Meyers, reiterated his company’s apology today during a House subcommittee hearing and went on to say that the company has launched a configuration update for its Falcon Sensor software system. Meyers was grilled Tuesday afternoon by lawmakers from the House’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection subcommittee over the company’s failure to properly address its faulty software update that led to a global IT outage in mid-July. Following the global outage, companies across the airlines, banking, telecommunications, and healthcare industries were deeply affected for weeks. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting about 8.5 million Microsoft (MSFT) Windows devices, per Reuters. “We are deeply sorry this happened, and we are determined to prevent this from happening again,” Meyers said at the hearing. “We have undertaken a full review of our systems and begun implementing plans to bolster our content update procedures so that we emerge from this experience as a stronger company.” During the grilling session, which was led by Republican Rep. Mark Green from Tennessee, Meyers said CrowdStrike (CRWD) takes “full responsibility” for the international system crashes. He also deemed that the issues were not the result of a cyberattack, nor was it induced by artificial intelligence. “The July 19 incident stemmed from a confluence of factors that ultimately resulted in the Falcon sensor attempting to follow a threat detection configuration for which there was no corresponding definition of what to do,” Meyers said. After the IT incident, CrowdStrike lost about $60 million in contract sales. The cybersecurity firm said that the incident scared off customers who were looking to close deals during the final weeks of the second quarter. Meyers announced during the hearing that the company had taken several steps to sharpen its system and would prevent another outage from happening at this level again. He stated that CrowdStrike will no longer unveil its software updates internationally to all customers in a single session. The company will also allow customers to select when they receive their updates. They have the option of waiting to be the second or third group of clients who will receive the update after it goes public. “Mistakes can happen,” Green said. “However, we cannot allow a mistake of this magnitude to happen again. A global IT outage that impacts every sector of the economy is a catastrophe that we would expect to see in a movie. It is something that we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Full Content:
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) director John L. Hennessy has sold shares of the company's Class A common stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transaction, dated September 23, involved the sale of 700 shares at a price of $165 each, totaling $115,500. Following the sale, Hennessy's direct and indirect holdings include 27,824 shares of Class A common stock and 6,416 shares of Class C capital stock, some of which are held by trusts. The transaction was executed under a pre-arranged trading plan known as Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to sell shares over a predetermined period of time. This plan was adopted by the John L. Hennessy and Andrea J. Hennessy Revocable Trust on November 1, 2023. Hennessy's remaining Class C capital stock holdings reflect both direct and indirect ownership through trusts. His indirect holdings in Class C capital stock amount to 6,093 shares, while direct holdings are at 323 shares. Additionally, Hennessy has interests in several tranches of Class C Google Stock Units (GSUs), which are set to vest over time subject to continued service on Alphabet's Board. Investors often monitor insider transactions for insights into executive confidence in the company's prospects. Sales and purchases of company stock by insiders can be routine, but they are disclosed to the public to ensure transparency. Hennessy's recent transaction is part of regular financial planning and does not necessarily indicate a change in the company's outlook or management's view of its potential. In other recent news, Alphabet Inc.'s Google has been making significant strides in various sectors. In a collaborative effort with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Google is addressing competition concerns related to the management of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. This partnership aims to develop a solution that addresses the CMA's competition concerns while considering the broader implications for user privacy and online services that rely on advertising revenue. In an innovative move, Google has teamed up with Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) to introduce an artificial intelligence assistant within a smartphone app for drivers. This assistant utilizes Google's Gemini large language models and cloud computing resources. The AI assistant is currently available to approximately 120,000 owners of Volkswagen’s Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) and Atlas Cross Sport models, with plans to expand its availability to other vehicles in the near future. Google has also engaged with the European Union to influence the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act, aiming to shape the rigor of this legislation that could impose significant fines for non-compliance. Google, along with other tech giants, has applied to join the working groups for the AI Act, seeking to contribute their perspective to the regulations. In a significant move into the carbon offset market, Google purchased 50,000 metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup named Mombak. This marks Google's first foray into carbon projects within Brazil and represents a commitment to achieve these credits by the year 2030. All these recent developments highlight Google's proactive approach towards addressing competition concerns, integrating advanced AI capabilities into consumer applications, influencing global AI regulations, and making significant commitments to environmental sustainability. As Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to make headlines with insider stock transactions, investors are keen to understand the company's financial standing. According to InvestingPro data, Alphabet boasts a robust market capitalization of approximately $2 trillion USD. This places the tech giant among the most valuable companies globally, reflecting its significant impact on the industry. Analyzing Alphabet's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is currently at 23.29, can provide investors with a clearer picture of the company's valuation. This metric is particularly interesting when considering the company's near-term earnings growth, as Alphabet is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to this growth. This suggests that the company's stock might be undervalued based on its earnings potential, an InvestingPro Tip that could indicate a favorable buying opportunity for investors. Furthermore, Alphabet's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stands at 13.38%, demonstrating the company's ability to increase its earnings over time. This sustained growth is a testament to Alphabet's strong position in the Interactive Media & Services industry, another InvestingPro Tip that underscores the company's prominence in its sector. For those interested in exploring more about Alphabet's financial health and future prospects, additional InvestingPro Tips are available. In fact, there are 11 more tips listed on InvestingPro that could provide valuable insights for investors contemplating their next move with Alphabet's stock.

This financial stability is crucial for investors looking for a secure investment, especially in a market that values liquidity and the ability to weather economic downturns. Alphabet's liquid assets also exceed its short-term obligations, further emphasizing the company's financial resilience.

Title: Here's How Much Nvidia Stock CEO Jensen Huang Has Sold Lately

Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang concluded a planned sale of more than $700 million worth of company stock, regulatory filings Tuesday showed. Huang had previously announced his intention to sell as many as 6 million shares of Nvidia by the first quarter of 2025 under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC's) 10b5-1 rule, which allows insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks. He reached that limit months ahead of the plan's expiration, with the sale of 120,000 shares worth nearly $14.3 million, according to an SEC filing. The CEO still holds 75.4 million Nvidia shares directly and another 786 million through various trusts and a partnership, according to another filing. Shares of Nvidia closed nearly 4% higher at $120.87 Tuesday. They've more than doubled in value since the start of the year amid booming demand for the company's chips to support artificial intelligence (AI).

Title: Nvidia stock's 20% drop is actually a good sign for the market, strategist says. Here's why

Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors (MTB), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, below. ANDY MILLS (AM): Big tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft have led the market higher over the last couple of years. Do you see that continuing in 2025? TONY ROTH (TR): Right now, we see a rotation trade into other areas of the market, but I think, longer term, we certainly expect to see those big names continue to grow earnings at a pretty rapid pace. One thing that’s important to keep in mind, though, is that it’s not a monolithic group. So there are some companies that are gonna do a lot better than others. Even within the Magnificent Seven, you’re probably going to see a rotation of some names out of that group and some names into that group. One of the aspects of what’s happening in the market today that I think is really quite notable is that we’re at new, all-time highs as we sit here. And Nvidia (NVDA) is probably about 20% off of its all-time high. Given what we experienced in the first half of the year — where it seemed to be a market driven by a single stock — to be able to say that at this point is pretty remarkable. I think most participants might have felt that it would be hard to get to these levels on the S&P without leadership from Nvidia. And not only have we not had leadership, but it’s actually been going in another direction. AM: Yeah. So AI is, I think, for most investors, a pretty obvious place where people have been investing. What other sectors are you guys looking at that people should try to get into this year? TR: Financials have worked pretty well this year — not all equally, again, but if you look, for example, at the big money center banks, they’ve done pretty well. Some of them have done extraordinarily well, like JP Morgan, which is priced at pretty lofty levels now. But overall, right now with rates coming down, if we don’t have a recession, which is our base-case view, that should certainly favor regional banks. And we think that, for example, also in the financial sector, we like insurance companies, which continue to benefit from these expanded premiums. And I think a lot of the costs are probably going to abate, but the premiums won’t come down as fast. So [insurance companies will] take advantage of that leverage. It’s almost like when oil prices come down but you don’t see the price at the pump come down quite as fast. So I think you’ll see that phenomenon with insurance companies. And then other areas that we like are discretionary companies within this economy, because we do think the consumer, particularly the higher-end consumer, is in good shape. And beyond that, we’re really focused across all sectors on quality companies — so companies that have attractive debt-to-equity ratios that are not too levered, that have low variability of earnings, that have good management teams, intellectual property, intellectual capital, et cetera. Those kinds of companies should do well in this type of environment. AM: Now, you mentioned that your firm doesn’t see a recession as a likely scenario going forward. What makes you guys believe that? TR: I would probably start with the labor market. The labor market is really the foundation for the consumer. So when you look at the labor market, what you see is that jobless claims are at an all-time low actually relative to the overall size of the labor market. And when you look at wages, real wages are not only positive, which we haven’t seen for a long time, but if you look at what we think of as (to get a little wonky) the second derivative, which is where a real wage is going, they’re actually increasing. They’re gaining ground. So when you look at that and you consider that the top three quartiles of the consumer still have excess savings and checking accounts, et cetera, that bodes really well for the economy. So the labor market is in pretty good shape. It’s not in great shape. It’s not in perfect shape. There are some concerning signals, as well, but that’s part of the normalization process. So the labor market’s in good shape, the consumer’s in good shape, CapEx continues to do well. And typically when you see a recession, there’s usually a catalyst. There’s usually excess investment, or there’s a bubble, a financial bubble, or there may even be an external, if you will, geopolitical or exogenous event. And so we don’t see any of those happening, necessarily. Sure, that could happen as a result of the election outcome, but there are so many levels of uncertainty with the election right now that we’re not investing for that. We’ll keep a very close eye on that, but right now we’re not tying the election to a recession. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

In the early hours of July 19, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD) published a faulty software update that temporarily disabled more than 8.5 million PCs that use its services. The outage caused chaos across banking, airlines, health care and several other industries, and it sent CrowdStrike shares plummeting more than 20% over the following two trading days. It also drew attention to the importance of reliable cybersecurity companies — and to the potential volatility of cybersecurity stocks. Cybersecurity stocks are shares of publicly-traded companies that protect computer systems from digital threats. Some, such as CrowdStrike, Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks, are completely focused on cybersecurity, while others, such as Datadog, Cisco, Broadcom and Dell, are diversified technology companies that provide cybersecurity services along with other offerings. According to Roosevelt Bowman, an investment strategist with Bernstein Private Wealth Management, the effect of major technical outages on cybersecurity companies is hard to predict. “It’s not often that you see a single event ‘doom’ a company,” Bowman says. However, he described two ways in which a bad-news event such as an outage can push down a stock’s price in the long term. The first is if the event in question pushes down a company’s expected future earnings to a point where it looks too expensive at its current price. The second way in which a scandal such as a technical outage can hurt the long-term trajectory of a stock, according to Bowman, is if there are “subsequent failures.” CrowdStrike’s software has been linked with minor computer outages before, although it has never experienced an outage on the scale of the July 19 incident. Only time will tell if it can rebuild its reputation from here.

Title: Bernant Arnault is falling down the rankings of the world's richest people

All may not be going well for Bernard Arnault, who owns luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, after a whopping $54 billion wipeout. LVMH’s Arnault was once considered to be the world’s richest man, but has now fallen to 5th place. With an aim to stay in his role longer, the founder of the Paris-based behemoth pushed to raise the retirement age from 75 to 80 in 2022. “I have five members of the family working in the group, he told Bloomberg in an interview this year. “Let’s see if one of them has the capacity to take over.” The 75-year-old boss had an estimated net worth of $231 billion in March, falling to $200 billion by June, before eventually plummeting to $177 billion on Monday. While he still remains wealthier than former Microsoft (MSFT) CEOs Bill Gates ($163 billion) and Steve Ballmer ($150 billion), he now ranks lower than Elon Musk ($265 billion), Jeff Bezos ($216 billion), Mark Zuckerberg ($200 billion) and Larry Ellison ($178 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The drop in Arnault’s rank comes after the company’s stock price dipped 20%, wiping out $54 billion from his net worth. LVMH reported a fall in revenues, with its wine and spirits section being hit the hardest. According to its earnings report, Champagne sales declined 15% in the first half of the year compared to the same period a year ago. But LVMH is not alone. Analysts at Bank of America Securities (BAC) recently downgraded European luxury stocks, citing sectorial slowdown into the second half of 2024 and next year. While LVMH was downgraded from “buy” to “neutral, Germany’s Hugo Boss (BOSSY) was moved from “buy” to “underperform.” The bank analysts warn of falling demand for luxury brands among high-spending Chinese consumers. Across European luxury firms, the Bank of America analysts expect a 1% revenue decline in 2024, addressing challenges across the luxury sector. France remains a key exporter of luxury bags in China. According to a study by consultancy Asterès, LVMH’s fashion exports accounted for 4% of total French exports in 2023. But LVMH may face some headwinds. The ongoing tensions between China and Europe could also put LVMH in a tough spot. The challenge also comes at a time when there have been some leadership shifts in the organization, with all five of Arnault’s children in operational roles and four having board seats.

September 24, 2024 14:29 ET | Source: Portnoy Law Portnoy Law Investors can contact the law firm at no cost to learn more about recovering their losses LOS ANGELES, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Ford Motor Company. ("Ford" or the "Company") (NYSE: F) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between October 28, 2021 and July 24, 2024, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Ford investors have until October 7, 2024 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford reported its second-quarter financial results for 2024, indicating that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” Consequently, Ford revised its full-year earnings outlook for its electric vehicle segment to account for “higher warranty costs than originally planned.” Reports from analysts and major news outlets, including The Associated Press and The Washington Post, noted that warranty and recall expenses reached $2.3 billion in the second quarter—$800 million more than in the first quarter and $700 million higher than the same period last year. As a result of this news, Ford’s stock price dropped by $2.51, or 18.36%, closing at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024, with unusually high trading volume. The class action complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, the Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose significant adverse information regarding the Company’s business and prospects. Specifically, it claims that the Defendants did not inform investors that: (1) there were deficiencies in the quality assurance of certain vehicle models; (2) these deficiencies were leading to increased warranty costs; (3) the Company’s warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues of the sold vehicles; (4) as a consequence, the Company’s profitability was likely to be negatively impacted; and (5) due to these issues, the Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business and future lacked a reasonable basis and were materially misleading.

Title: Novo Nordisk's CEO took the Washington hot seat over Ozempic prices. 3 takeaways from his testimony
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-novo-nordisk-wegovy-ceo-senate-testimony-1851656166
Time Published: 2024-09-24T17:50:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen agreed today, during a Senate committee hearing, to sit down with lawmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to look into the possibility of cutting list prices for the company’s popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs. Jørgensen was grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S. compared with other countries. Ozempic and Wegovy belong to a class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1 medications. Recent trials have found these drugs have additional health benefits such as cutting heart risks and alleviating symptoms of sleep apnea. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate the global market for this drug class will reach $105 billion by 2030. Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, due to high prices, insurers have been hesitant to cover these game-changing drugs, limiting patient access. This year, several politicians, including President Joe Biden, have called on pharma companies to slash the prices of GLP-1 drugs. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into Novo Nordisk’s high prices. Jørgensen agreed in June to testify in front of the committee, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Here are the three main takeaways from today’s Senate committee hearing. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52, while it’s just $59 in Germany. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02, despite being only $92 in the U.K. Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at today’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. Jørgensen pointed out that, at the pharmacy counter, the majority of patients with insurance pay $25 or less a month out-of-pocket for those medications. “Yes, millions of Americans with decent health insurance pay minimal amounts for their prescription drugs. That’s the good news,” Sen. Sanders responded. “The bad news is that they are paying a fortune in premiums, deductibles, and c0-payments for the insurance that covers those drugs.” Both sides agreed that PBMs, third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers, play a major role in keeping drug prices high. Jørgensen claimed Ozempic’s net price — the amount Novo Nordisk is actually paid by insurance companies after rebates and discounts are applied — has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S. since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has seen its net price fall similarly. But those declines, which keep the price of these drugs hundreds of dollars more expensive in the U.S. than in other countries, have not been seen by patients. In the chief executive’s written testimony, Jørgensen claimed that “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference.” He also warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences, such as health insurers dropping them from their formularies. Sen. Sanders claimed he has received written agreements from major PBMs — including Express Scripts (CI), United Health Group (UNH), and CVS Caremark (CVS) — to not drop coverage of Ozempic and Wegovy if their list prices are drastically cut. Jørgensen agreed to work with PBMs and the committee to look into the possibility of price cuts, as long as they don’t affect patient access. “Anything that can help patients get access, I’m supportive of, and that also includes collaborating and negotiating with anyone who can help,” Jørgensen said. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson added, in a statement emailed to Quartz, “While no single company can fix the American healthcare system alone, we look forward to continuing to work with policymakers and other stakeholders toward meaningful solutions for the people who rely on our medicines.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s 2024 Election Plan: Make Facebook, Instagram Less Political

Sports and celebrity news are now prioritized over election coverage on Meta’s social media platforms You may have noticed less political content on your Instagram and Facebook feeds this year — and that’s by design. Specifically, it’s the design of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who, according to The New York Times on Tuesday, wants his platforms to be less politically charged heading into the 2024 election. “On Facebook, Instagram and Threads, political content is less heavily featured,” the Times reported. “App settings have been automatically set to de-emphasize the posts that users see about campaigns and candidates.” Rather than political coverage, Meta’s apps are now more likely to recommend sports, cooking and celebrity news. That’s a stark change from four years ago, when Meta — then still under its original Facebook name — hit users with political news more frequently. The company, at the same time, actively policed content tied to the Trump-Biden election, as well as COVID-19. In mid-2020, Facebook started putting warning labels on posts from politicians and public figures that it deemed misinformation; the company also expanded its “hate speech” policy at the time. Zuckerberg, in the year leading up to the 2020 election, said he was “very focused on election security“; the company changed its rules around political ads, making it so American political advertisers had to have a U.S. address, for example. Facebook also had 40 teams, including an “election security” team, that partnered with Homeland Security, law enforcement and state and local election officials to oversee how the election was presented on Facebook and Instagram. That’s become less of a concern for Zuckerberg this time around. For instance, Zuckerberg no longer meets with his heads of election security on a weekly basis, the NYT reported, adding: “He has reduced the number of full-time employees working on the issue and disbanded the election integrity team … though the company says the election integrity workers were integrated into other teams.” Facebook was also active on the political front in the months after the 2020 election. Most notably, the company “indefinitely” banned Trump, saying the risk of having him on the platform was “simply too great” after the January 2021 Capitol Riot (Facebook and Instagram lifted all restrictions on Trump in July). One reason to expect Meta’s shift away from politics to continue: it hasn’t hurt business. The company’s stock price has nearly doubled since Election Day 2020, and is up 63% on the year to $564 per share. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg is now in an exclusive club with only two other members: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos

It’s one thing to be a billionaire. Only 2,781 members of the world’s population, which is nearing 8 billion people, have reached that status. And even fewer people have a multibillion-dollar net worth, with a select few reaching the coveted $100 billion position. But now there’s an even more illustrious camp: the $200 billion club. And only three of tech’s biggest leaders have reached that summit: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, however, not only just broke into the $200 billion club—he’s also the biggest winner on the list having accumulated dozens of billions in wealth this year. Zuckerberg’s wealth has ballooned by an incredible $72.2 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, bringing his total net worth to $200 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has had the second-biggest jump in net worth this year, gaining $58 billion in wealth. Growth aside, Musk has the highest net worth with $265 billion to his name, with Bezos tracking behind him at $216 billion. This places Zuckerberg ahead of other major tech executives including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I define our strategy as if we can learn faster than every other company, we’re going to win,” Zuckerberg said during a taping of the Acquired podcast last week. “We’re going to build a better product than everyone else because we’re going to get it out first or early. You learn faster.” Read more from Fortune –Mark Zuckerberg says Europe needs more consistent AI regulation—and even his privacy nemesis agrees –In comments reigniting Tim Cook feud, Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta ‘the opposite’ of Apple –LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram are hoovering up your data to train their AI. Here’s how to stop it –Instagram unveils Teen Accounts with mandatory parental controls –Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla says AI will handle 80% of work in 80% of jobs While Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook 20 years ago, only takes a $1 salary, he makes up for it in “other compensation” and his massive stake in Meta. He’s the largest shareholder of Facebook’s parent company, owning about 345.5 million shares, according to Meta’s April proxy statement. Plus, he took home $24.4 million in “other compensation” this year. Much of that other compensation goes toward protecting Zuckerberg, much as with other high-profile CEOs. “We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” Meta wrote in the SEC filing. Meta did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment regarding Zuckerberg’s net worth. Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, has performed well this year. Since the start of 2024, Meta’s stock is up a jarring 60%, and an even more impressive 85% year over year. It opened trade at more than $557 per share on Tuesday. Zuckerberg credits the company’s focus on AI for Meta’s strong performance this year. “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Zuckerberg said in an earnings statement in July. Indeed, revenue rose 22% to $39.07 billion from $32 billion in Q2. While AI has been a boon for the company, Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency” at Meta has been a challenge for many of its other workers and for some of its biggest projects, including augmented reality. This cost-cutting initiative started in February 2023 and has resulted in mass layoffs from the tech giant. “This decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,” Meta said in a statement. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: About 40% Of Jobs In U.S. Book Publishing Have Disappeared Since 1997
URL: https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/95996-over-30-years-40-of-publishing-jobs-disappeared-what-happened.html

After a year when publishing industry layoffs have frequently been in the headlines, it will surprise no one that the total number of jobs in the industry is in decline. But in an era marked by corporate consolidation, increased competition for consumer attention, and the emergence of alternative publishing models, the most recent government data suggests the loss of publishing jobs over the past three decades has been dramatic. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people employed in book publishing in the United States fell to 54,822 in 2023, down from 91,100 in 1997. If accurate, that represents a loss of about 40% of traditional publishing jobs in less than 30 years. The BLS stats are drawn from detailed employment data for book publishers, which, according to the agency, includes businesses that “carry out design, editing, and marketing activities necessary for producing and distributing books,” whether “in print, electronic, or audio form.” In 1990, the BLS recorded total book publishing employment at 85,800. Employment then peaked at 91,100 in June 1997, and was at 84,600 as late as December 2008. But the number of industry jobs appears not to have rebounded from the retooling that followed the Great Recession of 2007–2009. In 2012, employment had dropped to roughly 70,000, and in 2016 to approximately 60,000. The annual average bottomed out in 2021 at 51,161, down an eye-opening 44% from the BLS’s peak. In 2023—the most recent stats, released last month—employment has rebounded slightly, to 54,822. Notably, about 20% of publishing industry employment in 2016—10,269 jobs—was in New York City. In 2023, that number had slipped to 9,540, or about 17.4% of the publishing workforce. While government figures show that full-time employment in book publishing has been in decline since the 1990s, context is key. There have been significant shifts, including new technology and consolidation, that make it difficult to compare today’s publishing industry to the industry that existed three decades ago. For example, a 1992 report produced by Simba Information listed 20 companies across all publishing segments with sales of at least $200 million. Of those 20 publishers, 10 exist today, having swallowed up the other 10. And with every acquisition comes integration and a consequent net loss of jobs as companies improve their operating efficiencies. Indeed, publishing has become more efficient in the digital age. After all, despite the significant decline in publishing jobs, industry sales are still growing—although that growth is not keeping up with inflation, and even in absolute terms it appears to be slowing. During the 1990s, for example, sales growth in publishing exceeded 5% annually. By the early 2000s, it had slowed to about 1.5% per year and hit $25 billion in 2007, according to data from the Association of American Publishers. Meanwhile, the most recent AAP numbers show sales in 2023 were $29.9 billion. While publishing industry data is notoriously tricky to pin down given shifting accounting methods and data sources, the trend lines are nevertheless clear: book publishing employment has dropped by about a third, and sales have ticked up modestly. Certainly, profitability has improved. At the 2022 U.S. Book Show, Morgan Entrekin, longtime head of Grove Atlantic, pointed to the growing pressure on publishers—especially publicly traded ones—to deliver higher margins. “In 46 years, [trade book publishers have] never seen these levels of profitability,” he said, noting that historically, profit margins in the 5% range were seen as a healthy return. Today, the four of the Big Five trade publishers that report their financial results (next year it will be three with S&S now private) typically have margins above 10%. Traditional publishing has also ceded territory to new models. For example, digital self-publishing began to make its presence felt around 2007 with the launch of Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing. According to Bowker, in 2021 the number of self-published books—including e-books, print books, and digital audio—jumped to nearly three million, from just over 500,000 in 2011. Of course, self-publishing sales data is scarcer and more unreliable than data for the traditional publishing industry. Amazon recently revealed that in the 10 years Kindle Unlimited has been active, KDP authors have earned more than $3.5 billion in royalties, with more than $650 million of that coming in just the past 12 months. When you add in à la carte sales of self-published print and e-books by KDP authors as well as sales from other players in the self-publishing field, total self-publishing sales could be well north of $3 billion annually. But how many people would say they are employed in self-publishing? More to the point, where do they factor into publishing industry statistics? Few self-published authors are in the game full-time. And it is unlikely in any case that Amazon and the myriad other self-publishing companies (BookBaby, Draft2Digital, IngramSpark, and Lulu among them), which all run lean, have absorbed a significant number of the job losses reported by the BLS. Then there is the anecdotal evidence, which suggests that some of the “efficiency” realized by book publishers today has been achieved on the backs of staff: fewer full-time editors, designers, and production personnel, with more work shifted to the assistant level or outsourced to freelancers foreign and domestic—labor that would not be counted in the government’s statistics on publishing industry employment. With all the shifts of the past few decades, are the BLS stats an accurate portrait of the publishing industry job market? It’s hard to say. Surely no one in the industry would dispute that their ranks are shrinking, however. And what is certain is that the structure of employment in publishing has changed dramatically—a trend that is likely to continue. Loading...

Title: Novo Nordisk CEO blames drug 'middlemen' for high price of weight loss meds

Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen will shift the blame for the high prices of the company’s popular weight loss treatments to drug middlemen and the ‘complex’ U.S. health care system today during a committee hearing in Congress. Jørgensen is set to be grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, over what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S compared to other countries. “You have said that our amazing medicines can’t help patients if they can’t afford them. That is true,” Jørgensen plans to say during prepared opening remarks shared with Quartz. He adds, “it is clear that patients too often struggle to navigate the complex U.S. healthcare system. It is also clear that no single company can solve such vast and complicated policy changes.” In the chief executive’s written testimony, he goes on to specifically point the finger toward pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers. Jørgensen wrote that the net price — the amount that Novo Nordisk is actually paid after manufacturer rebates and discounts are applied — of Ozepmic has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S., since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has also seen its net price fall simlarily. However, “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference,” Jørgensen wrote. He warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences like health insurers dropping them from their formularies. The U.S. list price for Ozempic is $968.52 a month and $1,349.02 for Wegovy. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. The committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month, well above the drug’s price in other countries. In Germany, for example, Ozempic costs just $59 for a month’s supply. Wegovy’s U.S. net price is $809, while it costs just $92 in the United Kingdom. Jørgensen agreed to testify in front of the committee in June, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Last week, Sen. Sanders said that CEOs at major generic pharma companies have told him that they are willing to sell a generic version of Ozempic for less than $100.

Title: It's the 'year of the mandate' at offices, but hybrid and remote work aren't dying

Related Stories Amazon isn't the only major company cracking down on remote work — the tech giant joins other companies, including Citigroup, Walmart and UPS, in requiring workers to spend more time in offices in recent months. Even so, the share of people working remotely and hybrid has ticked up in the last year, while those working from an office full-time declined, according to a new report. Some 27% of workers say they work in a hybrid arrangement, up from 26% in 2023, according to a survey of 2,000 knowledge workers from Owl Labs, the video-conferencing technology maker. Another 11% say they work fully remotely, up from 7% in the last year, according to the report. The remaining 62% say they work from a physical office five days a week, down from 66% this time last year. It's "a surprise" to see remote and hybrid work increase slightly in what's shaping up to be "the year of the mandate," says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. But hybrid workers continue to face challenges in what they want versus what their employers require. Most say they prefer to be in-office three days a week (33%) followed by two (20%), but the most common in-office schedules actually require three (41%) or four (32%) days a week. Companies are also increasing their efforts to track employees' attendance during the week. Nearly half of employees say their employer has added or increased the use of employee tracking software to gather activity data in the past year. And workers say their employers are stricter about enforcing attendance policies (like being fired for noncompliance) now, compared with 2022, according to data from WFH Research. However, "the issue with strict attendance policies is that they can become unenforceable," says Jose Maria Barrero, co-founder of WFH Research and assistant professor at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México Business School. "If employees work from home effectively, and there is no real reason for them to come into the office other than 'it is just the policy,' will managers really punish them?" he says. "Are you willing to piss off a good employee and potentially push them to find a different job if their work is otherwise up to standard?" Some business leaders may create strict office policies to get people to quit and avoid layoffs, he says, "but I'm skeptical that they would take a hard line if things are working well." On the employee side, there's been "a severe backlash" to many attendance and tracking efforts, says Deepali Vyas, the global head of fintech, payments and crypto practice at Korn Ferry. "Employees want autonomy and feeling like they're not being micromanaged." When set up effectively, tracking policies and tools can "enhance transparency and performance," Vyas says. "But I feel like it's a bit invasive. It can actually erode trust, which is something really crucial in any workplace." In fact, 73% of professionals say employee-tracking initiatives like monitoring badge swipes and computer activity are not necessary or helpful, according to a recent Glassdoor poll of 1,400 users. However, Weishaupt expects 2025 will see a continuation of more RTO mandates, tracking software and badging enforcement, despite Owl Labs' and other data indicating that "employees want flexibility," he says. "And I think that will create a trust barrier between employers and employees." Want to master your money this fall? Sign up for CNBC's new online course.

China issued a series of stimulus measures to boost its hard-hit economy and housing market; U.S. stock futures are little changed after the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday at record highs; Boeing's (BA) "best and final" offer is rejected by its striking union workers; Novo Nordisk (NVO) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen faces a Senate hearing over the high cost of its weight-loss drugs; and Tesla (TSLA) shares are continuing to rise on Wall Street's optimism around its China and robotaxi operations. Here's what investors need to know today. China issued a broad stimulus package of monetary measures to boost a sluggish economy weighed down by a housing market slump and weak consumer sentiment. Beijing cut a key short-term interest rate, reduced rates on existing mortgages, lowered the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and announced plans for at least 800 billion yuan ($114 billion) of liquidity to shore up the struggling stock market. Crude oil futures—under pressure from weak demand in the Asian nation—rose, while American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) are gaining 5% in premarket trading. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes closed up Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both finishing at fresh record highs. U.S. shares have been boosted in recent days by the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut in more than four years, and investors are now on watch for more Fed comments as officials say that upcoming economic data will determine the size of future rate cuts. Boeing (BA) offered what it called its "best and final" offer to workers who have been striking since mid-September, crippling the plane maker's operations. Boeing offered the striking members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union base wage increases of 30% over four years, up from its previous offer of a 25% increase. The union dismissed the offer in an X post, saying the contract "was thrown at us without any discussion." Novo Nordisk (NVO) ADRs are rising 1% in premarket trading ahead of a Senate hearing on the high costs of the Danish company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify today before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which has accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. Telsa (TSLA) shares are trading 1% higher in premarket trading after leading S&P 500 gainers Monday with an almost 5% jump, as analysts highlighted several potential catalysts that could provide a boost for the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer. Barclays analysts said that based on data points from China, Tesla could exceed expectations with its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, while analysts at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also suggested Tesla could impress investors with its robotaxi event next month.

Title: Costco shares downgraded to Hold at Truist amid valuation concerns

On Tuesday, Truist Securities adjusted its stance on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), moving from a Buy rating to Hold. The firm has set a price target for Costco at $873.00. The downgrade reflects a cautious view on the stock's current valuation despite the company's strong market position and its success in gaining market share across various retail segments. According to Truist Securities, Costco has established significant barriers to entry in the retail sector and continues to exhibit robust business performance. "However, some changes like the shift towards scanning IDs on entry and packaging changes to their chickens could add some sls headwinds, key catalysts are in the rearview mirror and the stock's valuation leaves little room for error," said Truist analysts in a note to cients. Additionally, Truist Securities notes that while Costco's stock has seen substantial growth, increasing by approximately 60% over the past 12 months compared to the S&P 500's 30% gain, the stock is now trading at around 54 times forward twelve-month earnings per share (EPS), which is considered a multi-decade high. The analysts from Truist Securities stated, "The business remains strong, it is gaining share vs. virtually all classes of trade and likely has the highest barriers to entry in all of retail, in our view." Despite this, the firm suggests that the major catalysts for Costco's stock performance have already occurred. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) has made significant updates to its bylaws, introducing a cure process for shareholder director nominations. This move is part of a larger effort to refine the company's corporate governance practices and enhance communication with shareholders. Costco has seen considerable analyst activity and strong sales growth. Redburn-Atlantic revised its rating from "Buy" to "Neutral," citing concerns over the stock's valuation, despite raising the price target to $890. Oppenheimer, Stifel, and Baird maintained positive ratings, with Oppenheimer and Stifel raising their price targets to $955 and $915 respectively, due to robust sales growth and positive earnings estimates. Costco reported a 6.7% rise in U.S. comparable sales and a significant 23.3% growth in consolidated e-commerce sales. The company's non-foods category experienced a low double-digit increase, contributing to the robust performance. Baird maintained an Outperform rating with a consistent price target of $975, emphasizing Costco's steady global core comparable sales and a slight increase in its fourth-quarter earnings per share forecast. As investors digest the cautious stance from Truist Securities on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), a glance at the real-time data from InvestingPro provides additional context for the stock's current valuation. Costco holds a significant market capitalization of $406.57 billion, with a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 56.7, which aligns with Truist's concerns about the stock trading at a multi-decade high earnings multiple. Despite the high valuation, Costco's revenue growth remains robust, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. From an operational standpoint, Costco's gross profit margin stands at 12.5%, a figure that may raise some eyebrows considering the InvestingPro Tip that highlights the company's weak gross profit margins. However, investors might find solace in the company's ability to maintain dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, coupled with a strong return over the last year, which could signal a continued commitment to shareholder returns despite the high valuation metrics. For those seeking more detailed analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, including insights on Costco's cash flow capabilities and its position within the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry.

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 18: Roku's company logo is seen in front of Roku headquarters on ... [+] November 18, 2022 in San Jose, California. Roku announced plans to lay off 200 employees in the United States, or nearly 7 percent of its workforce. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Roku stock (NASDAQ: ROKU), a company that sells streaming media players, digital content, and advertising, has seen its stock decline by close to 17% this year, trading at levels of about $76 per share. This compares to Netflix stock, (NASDAQ: NFLX), which has gained about 44% over the same period. Roku has been weighed down by a mixed advertising market and slowing growth of its platform business. Roku stock currently trades at just about 2.8x forward revenues and 3.2x trailing revenues. Roku remains in the red, with profits likely to remain elusive this year. Does this make the stock expensive? Probably not. In fact, we think Roku stock has the potential to rise close to 3x in the next few years. Now the decrease in ROKU stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, and 125% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. But how could Roku possibly regain its footing and rise again? Let’s delve into the company’s revenue prospects to begin with. Roku’s revenue growth is expected to remain modest this year, rising by about 14%, from $3.5 billion in 2023 to $4 billion in 2024. This reflects challenges in the digital advertising market and a shift toward more affordable streaming plans, which has impacted Roku’s platform revenue. However, growth could accelerate to around 25% between 2024 and 2027, touching $7 billion levels. So why the potential rebound in revenue growth? Roku’s platform monetization could improve significantly. Engagement on Roku devices has remained strong, with total streaming hours up 20% in the latest quarter. The Roku Channel, its proprietary streaming service, has also seen a 75% year-over-year jump in streaming hours, becoming one of the leading free, ad-supported platforms in the U.S. This channel is poised to boost higher-margin advertising revenue. Additionally, Roku has been enhancing its ad capabilities by partnering with major ad-tech players like The Trade Desk, enabling more precise targeting and optimization. Additionally, with the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, U.S. consumer spending could pick up and this could drive a revival in their advertising expenditure in the coming quarters, thus helping Roku’s top line. Roku Could Turn Profitable Roku has been continuously loss-making in recent years, and the company is looking to cut costs aggressively. Over the first six months of this year, the company’s operating costs fell by about 10% driven by workforce and office space reductions in 2023. Roku is also generating more cash. Free cash flow stood at over $300 million for the trailing 12 months. As the company’s past investments in R&D and product development start paying off and as Roku’s business gains scale, it can boost margins meaningfully. For perspective, other companies in the advertising and media space such as the Trade Desk and Netflix had net margins of approximately 10% to 18% respectively, in recent quarters. If we assume that Roku can boost margins to about 10%, and factor in our revenue projections of roughly $7 billion by 2027, a net income of $700 million is possible by 2027. Roku’s Multiple Could Expand Now if Roku’s revenues grow 2x by 2027, the P/S multiple will shrink to half of its current level, assuming the stock price stays the same, correct? But that’s exactly what Roku investors are betting will not happen! If revenues expand 2x over the next few years, instead of the P/S shrinking from around 3x presently to less than 1.5x, a scenario where the P/S actually rises is possible. Why? Netflix trades at a P/S of about 8x, while The Trade Desk trades at about 20x. Moreover, Roku stock itself traded at levels of over 30x revenue during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now if we assume that Roku’s P/S multiple expands to about 5x, considering higher revenue growth and profitability, this would mean that revenue would grow about 2x, while the P/S multiple would rise by about 1.66x. This in turn could 3x the stock from levels of about $76 presently to over $220. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: Kazakhstan Says Second-Largest Lender Is Compliant With Sanctions Despite Critical Report
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/kazakh/2024/kazakh-240923-rferl01.htm
Time Published: 2024-09-24T07:10:40Z

By Chris Rickleton September 23, 2024 ALMATY -- Kazakhstan has defended the country's second-largest lender as being "fully" compliant with sanctions against Russia after a scathing report saw around 20 percent wiped off the Nasdaq-listed Kaspi.kz's stock price. A September 19 report published by Culper Research poured doubt on the claim by fintech giant Kaspi that it lacks exposure to sanctions-struck Russia and raised concerns about the group's past affiliations to a relative of former President Nursultan Nazarbaev who was convicted by a Kazakh court of major embezzlement in 2022. In a September 19 statement, Kaspi.kz called Culper's report "misleading" and "inaccurate." The report, Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money For Criminals And Kleptocrats, focused on Kaspi.kz's issuance of bank cards to Russians, tens of thousands of whom arrived in Kazakhstan in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. "As the U.S. and other nations continue to broaden sanctions against those found to be aiding Russia's wartime economy, we believe Kaspi now risks secondary sanctions," the report warned, justifying its "short" position on the company. Kaspi.kz is widely viewed as a success story in Kazakhstan, going from a relatively obscure bank to the country's leader in mobile payments and online marketplace services in some 20 years. In a September 23 statement, Kazakhstan's Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets called Kaspi "one of the country's systemically important and steadily developing banks, demonstrating sustainable growth and a high level of transparency." "The bank fully complies with the sanctions regime of the U.S., the European Union, and other foreign countries," the agency said, referring to the sanctions imposed on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main shareholders in Kaspi.kz are Kazakh billionaire Vyacheslav Kim, Georgia-born Mikhail Lomtadze, and Baring Funds, part of a Commonwealth of Independent States-focused private equity investor. Kaspi.kz listed in 2020 on the London Stock Exchange to become the its largest international tech public offering that year. In January it joined the Nasdaq in an initial public offering that saw the business valued at $17.5 billion. "Being the first company from Kazakhstan to successfully list on Nasdaq has obviously raised our profile amongst short sellers," Kaspi.kz said in its statement. Nazarbaev's nephew, Kairat Satybaldy, who once held a stake of around 30 percent in Kaspi, exited the company prior to the successful listings. In August, Lomtadze, who is CEO of Kaspi.kz, declared the company's intention to compete in the forthcoming privatization of Humo, neighboring Uzbekistan's state-backed payment system. In May, Lomtadze was revealed as the new owner of Wycombe Wanderers, a third-tier English soccer club.

Title: Amazon, ExxonMobil, Meta, Tesla, Others Labeled ‘Underminers of Democracy’

Time Published: 2024-09-24T03:47:04Z

A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Perhaps the greatest example of Exxon’s disinterest in democratic deliberation was its corporate commitment of nearly four decades to conceal from the public its own internal evidence that climate change was real, accelerating, and driven by fossil fuel use while simultaneously financing far-right think tanks in the US and Europe to inject climate scepticism and denialism into the public discourse. While it altered its public position on climate change years ago, Exxon continues to lobby against meaningful climate policy and still promotes fossil fuel and plastics use to the detriment of communities around the world. It benefits from another entry on our list, Meta, by spreading right-wing propaganda in favour of fossil fuels. It finances the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has led efforts to pressure the US Supreme Court to throw out climate change lawsuits seeking damages from Exxon and its competitors. Glencore has a track record of flaunting the law, pleading guilty to various charges in a number of countries. The largest trader of commodities and the largest mining company in the world by revenue, Glencore controls or produces huge portions of the global supply of coal, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals, metals, fuels and foods. The company’s undermining of democracy is not in dispute, as it has in recent years pled guilty to committing bribery, corruption, and market manipulation in countries as varied as Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The scale of Glencore’s global lobbying lays bare the organisational conviction that it, rather than the voting public, should determine policy. While it publicly shows itself to support measures such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for years it has made use of right-wing consultants to spend “millions bankrolling a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand by undermining environmental activists, influencing politicians and spreading sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media.” This self-serving posture is also exhibited in its efforts to undermine popular climate policy in the European Union, the United States, and South Africa. Meta’s role in politics and its ability to influence people, including its users falling victim to misinformation, has long made the company the target of critics and led to its inclusion on the list. The world’s largest social media company, Meta is the parent of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Combined, these products have nearly four billion users – the same number of people estimated to be voting worldwide in 2024. The company’s scale, and its corporate behaviour, have led some to call it “a foreign state, populated by people without sovereignty, ruled by a leader with absolute power.” Meta’s algorithms can quite literally alter humanity’s perceptions of reality. Its revenue model exploits trillions of personalised data points to deliver highly effective advertising to its users. That has made it a perfect target for data breaches seized on by authoritarians and an ideal vessel for right-wing political parties to spread propaganda around the world. Violent, far-right militias in the US use Facebook to recruit new members. In Germany, the far-right AfD used Facebook to stoke anti-immigrant hatred and position itself for unprecedented success in June’s European parliamentary elections. While Tesla may be the world’s leading EV maker, that standing has come at the expense of workers rights, with the company engaging in a long history of combating unionization efforts. In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the right to organise, refused to engage in collective bargaining, and provoked unprecedented strike action for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of Worst Union-Busters of 2023. Tesla’s factories have “reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.” But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that undermine consultation standards with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where child labour has allegedly been employed. The Vanguard Group makes the list for concentrating its power to such a degree that even its founder was worried about where the company was headed. One of the “Big Four” institutional investors in the world alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, Vanguard’s holdings put it “into an extreme position of power” at many of the companies it funds and makes it “the voice that matters most among investors.” This concentration of power troubled even Vanguard’s late founder, John Bogle, who wrote in 2018 that “If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation.” Despite holding billions of dollars in worker money, Vanguard recently abandoned one of its most public commitments to environmental and social governance. After signing on to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2021, it left in 2022, bowing to pressure from its far-right friends and provoking a backlash from more than 1,000 of its more climate-friendly clients. The ITUC’s list, and the cases it makes, is a damning indictment of the included companies. The ITUC minces no words in calling out the seven companies for their actions. These companies deploy complex lobbying operations to undermine popular will and disrupt existing or nascent global policy that could hold them accountable. They are invariably led by ultra-wealthy individuals that support and finance far-right politicians and parties to further their own interests. When the far-right wins power, it discredits and defunds democratic global institutions; reduces taxes on the wealthy and on corporations; undercuts living wages; favours bilateral aid financing over multilateralism; and cracks down on human, trade union, and democratic rights, as evidenced by the ITUC’s Global Rights Index. If more organizations continue to shine a spotlight on the actions of the companies on the list, public perception could eventually force them to change how they do business.

Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month that will take effect after the closing bell on Sept. 30. Here's what you need to know about the split. Shareholders will receive nine new Super Micro shares for every one they already own. Their overall stake in the company won’t change, but the stock will subsequently trade for 10% of its previous price. In other words, if Super Micro shares were trading at $1,000 before the split, an investor holding one share before the split would hold 10 shares priced at $100 each after the split. (Companies can also hold reverse splits, as some have done lately.) Super Micro shares skyrocketed early in 2024 to a high of nearly $1,200 due to surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. They traded closer to $600 when the split was announced, and closed Monday at about $465. The shares have lost more than half their value over the past six months, thanks in part to disappointing recent results. Even so, the stock is still roughly 65% higher year-to-date. The move would be the latest split by a high-flying tech stock, with Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) having already split their shares 10-for-1 this year.

The sale took place on September 20, 2024, and was executed in multiple trades with prices ranging from $489.18 to $490.00. The reported average sales price represents a weighted average, reflecting the various prices at which the stock was sold. Following this transaction, Madabhushi's direct ownership in the company decreased to 15,030.79 shares. In a separate transaction on the same day, Madabhushi also exercised options to acquire 2,598 shares of Mastercard stock at a price of $344.48 per share, totaling nearly $895,000. This transaction was carried out under a pre-planned trading plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows company insiders to set up a predetermined plan to buy or sell company stock. The plan was adopted on June 14, 2024, for personal financial management purposes. The filing also disclosed details about Madabhushi's employee stock options. As of the reporting date, he was awarded 8,054 employee stock options on March 1, 2022. Of those, 299 have vested and the remaining 2,685 are set to vest on March 1, 2025. These transactions provide insight into the trading behavior of one of Mastercard's top executives and are disclosed to the public as part of the company's commitment to transparency regarding the ownership and dealings of its insiders. Interested parties can request detailed information on the number of shares sold and the specific prices from the SEC, the issuer, or a security holder of the issuer, as the reporting person has undertaken to provide full information upon request. In other recent news, Mastercard has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share and announced a strategic acquisition of Recorded Future, a global leader in threat intelligence, for $2.65 billion. This acquisition, expected to contribute to Mastercard's revenue growth and diversification of services, has received positive outlooks from analyst firms Baird, BMO Capital Markets, and TD Cowen, while Compass Point has given Mastercard a Neutral rating. Simultaneously, Mastercard has priced new note issuances, including a $750 million note due in 2028 at 4.10%, a $1.15 billion note due in 2032 at 4.35%, and a $1.10 billion note due in 2035 at 4.55%. Baird suggests these issuances will likely have a negligible or neutral effect on the company's earnings per share. In a separate development, Safaricom, Kenya's leading telecommunications company, has partnered with Mastercard to enhance payment acceptance and cross-border remittance services in Kenya. This partnership is expected to leverage Safaricom's M-PESA's extensive merchant network and Mastercard's international payment infrastructure, potentially boosting Kenya’s payment acceptance market growth. The first initiatives of this partnership are expected to be rolled out in the coming months. These are the recent developments in Mastercard's strategic and financial landscape. Amidst the insider trading activity at Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), it's important for investors to consider the broader financial landscape of the company. Mastercard, a prominent player in the Financial Services industry, is not only known for its operational success but also for its consistent shareholder returns. The company has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years, showcasing a strong commitment to returning value to its investors. InvestingPro Data reveals that Mastercard boasts a market capitalization of $459.17 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the market. Despite recent insider sales, the company's stock has been trading near its 52-week high, with a price percentage of 99.04% of that peak. This indicates a robust performance in the stock market and investor confidence in the company's prospects. However, it's worth noting that Mastercard is trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 37.85 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 sitting at 36.21. This high valuation could suggest that the stock is priced optimistically relative to its near-term earnings growth. Moreover, the company's Price/Book multiple during the same period is at 61.89, which is considered high and might raise valuation concerns for value-focused investors.

Title: Nvidia Versus AMD: Which AI Stock Is The Better Buy Right Now?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvidia-vs-amd-which-ai-stock-better-buy-now/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:36:08Z
Full Content:
getty A year ago, there was only Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race. But now investors are looking at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a potential competitor. Which AI stock should have a place in your portfolio? Let's lay out the details so you can decide. Nvidia designs semiconductors for use in AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 5G networks and data centers. While chip sales drive revenue, the company also supports a full platform of related offerings that developers use to create, deploy, run and scale enterprise applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia established itself in the late 1990s by creating the graphics processing unit (GPU), primarily for use in gaming applications. In 2013, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw a bigger picture for his company. He saw artificial intelligence as the future of computing—and believed Nvidia could lead that future. The company then began working on programmable GPUs to support complex computing operations. Today, Nvidia is the recognized leader in AI infrastructure, selling far more AI chips than any competitor. The chip designer also maintains a customer list that includes the best tech stocks in the world. AMD has historically battled with Intel for market share in central processing units (CPUs). Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary. CUDA has a strong reputation, but some projects may require the flexibility of AMD's open-source solution.

Multiple research companies and AMD's CEO have predicted strong double-digit annual growth for AI infrastructure spending over the next several years. The growth opportunity is somewhat different for our two companies, however. In short, Nvidia will be playing defense, while AMD plays offense. With a running start in the AI space, Nvidia now owns an estimated 80% market share. The quick rise to the top created extreme growth in revenues and profits, as tech companies rushed to build out their AI capabilities. Unfortunately for Nvidia, the spending may moderate just as competitors come to market with viable alternatives. Nvidia can find growth, however, by doing what it does best: pushing the limits of what high-performance computing can do in terms of speed and efficiency. Improving its platform to bring AI computing to a wider market could be another source of growth. The company won't be complacent under Huang's direction. Nvidia has recently shortened its product refresh cycle from two years to one year—presumably to keep pace with AMD's update cadence. AMD has more to gain and less to lose than Nvidia, which is the more interesting position to hold. AMD chips are currently cheaper and about 80% as powerful as Nvidia's according to AI software firm MosiacML. After testing AMD MI250 alongside Nvidia A100 last year, MosiacML CTO Hanlin Tang believes AMD can close the performance gap. That will be AMD's path to solid market share and revenue gains, especially if the company stays competitive on price and can produce enough to meet demand. Both companies will have to manage supply constraints, regulations that limit the revenue opportunity in China as well as rising competition. But they also face specific challenges related to where each stands in its AI growth trajectory. Nvidia's biggest challenge will be defending its position. The sheer size of the market ensures fierce competition as GPU makers position themselves for a piece of AI spending. To keep from losing market share, Nvidia will need to innovate and execute product rollouts flawlessly. Ongoing improvements in speed and efficiency will support higher spending even as the initial AI buildout slows. In the absence of impressive product upgrades, Nvidia could face share losses as spending moderates. That would be a revenue headwind, which likely won't sit well with Nvidia investors. AMD's primary challenge is establishing itself as the best second option in AI, while integrating four acquisitions made in the last two years. The acquisitions should support a more favorable competitive position, but it won't be enough to overtake Nvidia's dominance. So, the big risk for AMD is missing its target and ending up competing for the third or fourth position in the industry. Supply constraints or strategic, product or execution errors could open the door for another player like Intel to win market share. For more information, see Nvidia vs. Intel. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock and AMD stock. Both companies have an average rating of strong buy. With 40 analysts reporting on Nvidia, there are 20 strong buys, 17 buys and three holds. No one is recommending investors sell their NVDA positions. The 30 ratings for AMD include 15 strong buys, 11 buys and four holds. As with NVDA, analysts don't see a case for selling AMD currently. To evaluate market sentiment, we can look at NVDA and AMD stock price trends relative to the broader market. NVDA has outperformed AMD and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last six months. Nvidia is up nearly 30%, the S&P 500 grew 10% and AMD has fallen 14%. Performance in the last month, however, shows Nvidia as the loser. The company lost 10%, while AMD and the S&P 500 made slight gains. This is partly a function of Nvidia's high valuation, which makes it more reactive to economic news. AMD is the better AI stock in terms of value and upside. Yes, the company is an underdog that's unlikely to replace Nvidia as the recognized AI leader. But, AMD has operated from second place before and thrived under its current leader Su. Plus, the addressable market is so large that a smaller share position still means massive growth for AMD. Nvidia already has a huge growth record going for it, but the company is quickly lapping the big AI-related gains it has generated to date. Comparisons will get harder from here on out and that could create more volatility for the NVDA stock price. Nvidia has the advantage of being the first to market a comprehensive solution set for AI computing. AMD has a smaller offering which it has been growing through internal product development and acquisitions. Nvidia is estimated to have 70% or more market share in AI chips. AMD's market share is probably closer to 10%. AMD is a safer bet than Nvidia stock as a long-term play, though both companies are poised for bright futures. AMD's valuations are more reasonable, and Nvidia may be closer to seeing its growth level off. Both companies provide high-performance, AI-capable processors and related products and services including software for application development. Nvidia's platform CUDA is proprietary, while AMD's ROCm is open source. Open-source applications are more flexible but can also be more cumbersome.

(“CrowdStrike” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired CrowdStrike securities between November 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD. Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike’s technology was “validated, tested, and certified.” The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. What's Next? A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint, you can visit the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Client Relations Manager, Nathan Miller, of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 332-239-2660.

CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify Tuesday from the company’s home in Denmark before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The committee accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. The committee said Americans with Type 2 diabetes pay $969 a month for Ozempic, compared to $155 in Canada, $122 in Denmark, and $59 in Germany. It added that Americans are charged $1,349 a month for Wegovy, more than the $186 in Denmark, $140 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom. In an interview with NBC News last month, Jorgensen defended the company’s pricing, saying that insurance coverage varies from country to country, and that most Americans with health insurance pay $25 a month for Wegovy. Novo Nordisk shares were down 3.3% at $123.55 in intraday trading Monday, extending Friday's losses after the company reported disappointing results from a study of an experimental weight-loss treatment. Still, they are up about 19% from the start of the year. TradingView

Constellation Energy (CEG) has received positive analysts' reports after the power utility's announcement last Friday it would be restarting Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide electricity for Microsoft's (MSFT) data centers. Barclays analyst Nicholas Campanella wrote in a note to clients that the move was "somewhat unexpected by the market," and that Barclays sees it "as positive" for the company, as well as for Talen Energy Group (TLN) and Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG). Campanella has an "overweight" rating on Constellation, with a price target of $211. KeyBanc analysts said Constellation's deal with Microsoft "suggests attractive economics" and they expect "positive momentum to continue." The called it "an important catalyst in demonstrating the value of nuclear generation" in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). KeyBanc has an "overweight" rating on the stock as well, and it also raised the price target to $265 from $230. The news on Friday sent Constellation Energy shares skyrocketing 22% to an all-time high. Although they are little changed in early afternoon trading Monday, they have gained about 120% year-to-date.

Title: Danish PM shrugs off risks of Ozempic maker’s economic dominance

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed concerns that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Scandinavian nation’s largest corporation, could someday drag down its economy the way the once-dominant Nokia (NOK) did to Finland in the 2000s. With a market value of $570 billion, Novo Nordisk has surpassed Denmark’s annual GDP. However, Frederiksen told Bloomberg on Monday that she didn’t see any risk associated with the size of Novo Nordisk. “I am extremely proud that we have big, now global, companies coming from Denmark. I don’t see a lot of risks with even the size of some of the companies, because we have a very strong economy also in other sectors,” Frederiksen said. “But we have of course to watch it.” Unrelenting demand for Novo Nordisk’s diabetes and weight loss drugs has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH last year. The Danish pharma giant helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to do so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, forecast earlier this year that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, due primarily to Novo Nordisk. In 2023, Denmark’s GDP grew 1.8% — and much of its boost is owed to the pharmaceutical industry. Without pharmaceuticals, the agency says, the country’s GDP would have instead fallen 0.1%. Leading that growth is Novo Nordisk, with analysts expecting continued sales increases. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate that the global market for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic will reach $105 billion by 2030. The company reported in January that its 2023 sales jumped 31% to 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($33.8 billion), compared with 177 billion Danish kroner ($25 billion) in 2022. It also projects sales will increase by up to 22% to 28% in 2024. The situation is beginning to resemble Finland’s past reliance on Nokia, the once-dominant telecommunications company. According to estimates from the Finnish Economic Research Institute, Nokia accounted for 25% of Finland’s GDP growth between 1998 and 2007. But when rising competition from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Samsung in the smartphone market led to Nokia’s rapid decline in the early 2010s, Finland faced significant economic challenges. This downturn, combined with the effects of the Great Recession, resulted in widespread job losses and ushered in over a decade of economic difficulties for the country. Addressing concerns that Denmark could face similar challenges with its reliance on Novo Nordisk, Frederiksen emphasized the country’s economic diversity. “A good thing is that our export portfolio is spread across several areas that are less sensitive to the business cycle than in other places,” she said. Denmark is also home to other major companies like Carlsberg, AP Moller-Maersk (AMKBY), Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY), and Lego.

Title: Qualcomm has good reasons to bid for Intel — but a takeover probably won't happen

If Qualcomm sees it through, its takeover of Intel would likely be the biggest in Silicon Valley history. While it has good reasons to go after the storied chip giant, a lot is working against it. The possibility of Intel handing its 56-year history over to a younger rival emerged last week after several reports said that the California semiconductor firm Qualcomm had approached it for a takeover. Qualcomm is no newbie in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 1985, 39 years ago. Since then, it has grown into a company worth over $188 billion, specializing in areas such as wireless networks, smartphone processors, and modems. But recent trouble brewing at Intel, a longtime chip designer and manufacturer, has apparently given Qualcomm reason to consider acquiring a company that has lost more than half its value this year and dropped to a market capitalization of just over $93 billion. While some of its top competitors, like Nvidia, have soared to new heights as a result of the generative-AI boom, Intel has struggled to capitalize on investor interest in the technology. It has also grappled with production and strategy challenges. The company took a serious tumble in August — a month in which it lost almost $30 billion in market value — after announcing the layoffs of 15,000 employees and a suspension of its dividend from the fourth quarter of this year. It's worth noting that Qualcomm's talks to take over this troubled business are very early stage and exploratory. A person close to Qualcomm told the Financial Times that the company "would only pursue a friendly deal." For some, the logic to pursue the deal is apparent. Speaking on CNBC last week, Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst, said Intel's exposure to key areas like data centers and the PC market, as well as its chip-manufacturing capabilities — which Qualcomm lacks as it outsources that process to Taiwan's TSMC — meant there were "synergies in this." The company has also taken steps that seem to make it a more attractive purchase. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced a set of drastic measures last week to bring change to the company that could set it on a brighter path. He said these included a "multi-year, multi-billion-dollar" deal to work on custom chip designs with the tech heavyweight Amazon Web Services, a pause on plans to build plants in Europe, and the separation of its manufacturing unit, Intel Foundry, into its own entity. That said, not everyone is convinced that Qualcomm needs Intel — or that a buyout would be a good idea for either company. Richard Windsor, an equity-research analyst and the founder of Radio Free Mobile, thinks that while "it is possible to see how Qualcomm and Intel could fit together" — one company designs chips and the other has factories — a lot of Intel's bits wouldn't fit so well. "The vultures are hovering around Intel and while Intel will make a tasty and nutritious meal for some, I think Intel would end up sticking in Qualcomm's crop and give it a bad case of indigestion," he wrote in a note on Monday. He points to a few key reasons. Intel's x86 processors lag behind Qualcomm's and its rival firm Arm's offerings. Redesigning chips to be made by Intel "sounds like a risky proposition," he said, given Qualcomm's "already established excellent relationships" with manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ming-Chi Kuo, a Taiwan market analyst at the financial-services firm TF International Securities, went a step further, saying in a post over the weekend that a takeover of Intel could be "disastrous" for Qualcomm. My industry survey also indicates that Qualcomm is currently in takeover talks with Intel. However, if this acquisition were to go through, it could prove disastrous for Qualcommhttps://t.co/fJ7EozISve His rationale was that Qualcomm's "most critical focus should be on establishing competitiveness in AI chips" for segments like smartphones and that he didn't see an acquisition of Intel helping. It could boost its position in the market for artificial-intelligence PCs, but the analyst said he thought Qualcomm already had a strong standing in that area, with its processors used in Microsoft's Windows on Arm platform — a version of Windows running on Arm technology that Microsoft is committed to. "While the acquisition of Intel could rapidly increase Qualcomm's PC market share, it comes at a significant cost," he wrote. "Qualcomm can grow in the AI PC market even without the acquisition." It's also unclear how Qualcomm would find the cash to buy Intel. The company's cash on hand is $13 billion, but even with its free cash flow, it still falls far short of Intel's price. And the impact on competition would likely spark alarm among regulators. A Qualcomm bid for Intel could face similar regulatory obstacles to Nvidia's takeover attempt for Arm in 2020, which it abandoned in 2022. Intel will, of course, want to consider its options. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that a new option was on the table after the investment giant Apollo offered to make a "multibillion-dollar investment" in the company. That could offer the chip firm vital capital for its new plans and help it stand on its own two feet. Jump to

Alaska Airlines (ALK) said an IT issue was behind an issue with its system that caused flights to be delayed and a ground stop to be issued in Seattle Sunday night. The airline said the issue was resolved around 1 a.m. ET Monday, and told users flight operations and the airline's website should be back to normal. A total of 249 flights from Alaska Airlines were delayed Sunday, about 30% of their total schedule, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. "Last night, we experienced an IT issue that caused significant disruption to our operation—including delayed flights," the airline said in a statement. "The issue has been resolved, but we expect residual impacts to our operation. We sincerely apologize to our guests who are impacted and are working to get all our guests to their destinations." The company also told Reuters that the incident was not the result of a hack or any malicious activity. Earlier this month, the airline lifted its revenue and profit projections for the current quarter, in part thanks to the struggles of competing airlines during this summer's CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage that delayed or canceled thousands of flights. Alaska Air Group shares were up 2.5% to $41 in early trading Monday and have gained close to 5% since the start of the year.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new chip-making factories in the United Arab Emirates amid surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." Among the hurdles on the technical side: The need for "super-clean water" to rinse silicon wafers—an issue when most of the UAE's water is produced via desalination—and "concerns about the availability of engineering talent to staff major new factories far from the companies' home bases." The report also said that the two companies have had talks with U.S. officials worried that the advanced AI chips produced would make their way to China, a key trading partner of the UAE. Government subsidies globally have been helping the chip industry expand in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In the U.S., the government has been doling out billions in grants as part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to ensure production is done domestically. TSMC's American depositary receipts (ADRs), which edged higher as markets opened Monday, are up almost 70% this year.

Title: What Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Really?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2024/09/23/what-is-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-really/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg You probably hear about the Dow Jones Industrial Average every day, but how much do you really know about it? Q. What is the Dow Jones Industrial Average anyway? A. It’s a venerable U.S. stock-market index, that Charles Dow invented in 1896. It comprises 30 stocks, which the selection committee at Dow Jones & Co. (now part of News Corp.) considers to be leaders in their industries. Q. Was it always 30 stocks? A. When Charles Dow invented the index, it contained only 12 stocks. Some of the original stocks were American Cotton Oil Co., American Sugar Refining Co., Chicago Gas Co., National Lead Co. and United States Leather Co. Many of the original 12 merged into other companies and none of them are still in the index. Q. Are the stocks equal-weighted in the index? A. Not at all. They are weighted according to each stock’s price. That’s because the index was created before there were computers. Charles Dow added up the 12 prices and divided by 12. As a result of this quaint weighting system, Goldman Sachs (GS), with a stock price of $498.93 as of September 21, has about ten times the weight of Verizon (VZ), with a stock price of $44.33. Unscientific? You bet. Most modern stocks indices, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, are weighted according to each stock’s market value. Q. Then why do people still pay attention to the Dow industrials? A. Professionals mostly use the S&P 500. But the Dow carries an aura of familiarity, history and tradition. Also, it’s nice to be able to research stocks (even if in a crude fashion) before 1923 when Standard & Poor’s started to publish an index. Q. What’s the highest weighted stock in the Dow? A. At the moment, it is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), with a stock price of $575, giving it an 8.9% weight in the average. Q. What’s the most lightly weighted stock? A. Intel Corp. (INTC), priced at $21.84, for a 0.34% weight. Q. What’s your favorite stock among the 30? A. I think highly of JPMorgan Chase and Co. (JPM). The nation’s largest bank, headed by the capable and charismatic Jamie Dimon, should benefit as the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates. Q. What’s your least favorite? A. Probably Boeing Co. (BA). The strike by its machinists will get resolved, but I’m more worried about the long-term fallout from the company’s recent safety failures (most notably, a fuselage panel falling off in flight). To shore up quality and prevent future accidents, I believe Boeing will have to slow production. It will also be burdened with more federal regulatory oversight. Q. Is the word “industrial” in the index’s title misleading? A. A bit. For Dow index purposes, if a stock isn’t a utility or transportation stock, it’s an industrial. Q. What is Dow Theory? A. The theory postulates that a market advance is sustainable if, and only if, the Dow Jones transportation average (which Charles Dow invented in 1884) “confirms” a rise in the Dow Industrials. I’m a bit skeptical of the theory. Services are now a big part of the economy, reducing the importance of transportation. Q. How often do the components of the industrial average change? A. In 130 years, the Dow Jones selection committee has changed the components of the average 58 times. In most cases, more than one stock was replaced. Thus, the average has 30 current members and (if my count is correct) 111 former members. Q. What are the most recent changes? A. This year, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) was added and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) was dropped. In 2020, the selection committee added Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Salesforce Inc. (CRM) to the average, eliminating Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Raytheon Technologies Corp. (RTX). Q. Do stocks dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average usually flop? A. Not at all. In fact, during the past 25 years, stocks kicked out of the average has outperformed their replacements. General Electric Co., which was one of the index’s original members, has revived its fortunes (and split into three successor companies) since it was booted in June 2018. GE was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, which has fallen 84% in the past five years and was itself kicked out in February 2024. Disclosure: Personally and for clients, I own shares in Pfizer. Some of my clients own Exxon Mobil, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. A hedge fund I run has call options on Intel, RTX and Walgreens, and put options on Boeing. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: What's Happening With FMC Stock?

UKRAINE - 2021/05/31: In this photo illustration the FMC Corporation (Food Machinery and Chemical ... [+] Corporation) logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) FMC Corporation stock (NYSE: FMC), an agricultural science company focused on products to improve crop yield and quality, currently trades around $64 per share, roughly 51% below its pre-inflation shock highs of around $131 seen in April 2022. FMC has fared much worse than its peer – CF Industries stock (NYSE: CF) – down 10% over this period. FMC stock has been weighed down after falling sales volume and destocking dampened its financial performance over the last year or so. Its business in Latin America also took a massive hit, with sales down 33% y-o-y in 2023. FMC saw its stock trading at around $101 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it’s still trading 36% below those levels. This compares with 51% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period. The decrease in FMC stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FMC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $130 implies that FMC stock will have to gain around 2x from here, and we don’t think that will materialize anytime soon. We do think FMC stock has a some room for growth. It currently trades at 2x trailing revenues, compared to its average P/S ratio of 2.3x seen over the last three years. Notably, the $72 average of analysts price estimate reflects around 12% upside from here. Our detailed analysis of FMC Corporation’s upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession. 2022 Inflation Shock Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far: In contrast, here’s how FMC stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis. Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis FMC and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis FMC stock declined 20% from nearly $18 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak for the markets) to $14 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It bounced after the 2008 crisis to levels of around $20 in early 2010, rising nearly 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124. FMC’s Fundamentals Over Recent Years FMC Corporation’s revenue declined from $5.0 billion in 2021 to $4.1 billion in the last twelve months. This can be attributed to lower sales volumes amid destocking of its products. A drought in Brazil last year also weighed on its sales. Not only did the company see its sales decline, its operating margin contracted from 22.5% in 2021 to 13.9% now. However, there has been some recovery this year. The company’s Q2 sales were up 4% -y-o-y on an organic basis. The North America region led this growth with sales rising 24% y-o-y. Its adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share were up 26% y-o-y. Looking forward, FMC expects its revenue to be in the range of $4.30 billion to $4.50 billion in 2024, reflecting a 2% decline at the midpoint versus 2023. It expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.64 per share, reflecting a decline of 12% at the midpoint versus 2023. Does FMC Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock? FMC’s total debt increased from $3.3 billion in 2021 to $4.2 billion now, while its cash decreased from $517 million to $472 million over this period. The company also garnered $481 million in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Given that FMC’s market capitalization is $8 billion, a debt level of $4 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of around 50%. Its cash as a percentage of assets of under 4% is low. This implies that the company’s financial position isn’t great. Conclusion With the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe FMC Corporation stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, the pressure on the company’s sales volume and a large debt obligation, remains a significant risk factor to realizing these gains.

Intel (INTC) shares are surging in premarket trading as Apollo Global Management reportedly mulls an investment, days after another report of a Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover approach; Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Dell Technologies (DELL) become members of the S&P 500 today; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building UAE chip megafactories; AstraZeneca (AZN) shares are falling as its breast cancer drug misses its target; and China's sudden call for a press briefing tomorrow is raising expectations of a massive stimulus plan by regulators. U.S. stock futures are edging higher after the Federal Reserve's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut last week. Here's what investors need to know today. Intel (INTC) shares are jumping 4% in premarket trading after Bloomberg reported on Sunday that asset manager Apollo Global Management has offered to invest as much as $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker. The news came after The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday afternoon that Qualcomm (QCOM) has approached Intel about a potential acquisition. Intel shares have lost more than half their value this year. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) stock is slipping 1% and Dell Technologies (DELL) is edging lower in premarket trading as the two companies join insurer Erie Indemnity (ERIE) in becoming members of the S&P 500 today. However, the data-analytics firm and the PC maker have both seen their shares gain in the runup to today's benchmark index entry. The companies will be replacing American Airlines Group (AAL), Etsy (ETSY), and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO). Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new factories in the United Arab Emirates to meet surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." AstraZeneca's (AZN) American depositary receipts (ADRs) are falling about 2% after the pharma giant said its experimental cancer drug datopotamab deruxtecan, jointly developed with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo, failed to meet goals in a Phase 3 breast cancer trial. The news comes just weeks after the Anglo-Swedish firm said a late-stage trial of the same drug didn't significantly improve patients' overall lung cancer survival rates. China announced plans for an ad-hoc press briefing tomorrow on the economy by its financial regulators, including its top central banker—fueling investor hopes that Beijing is planning to issue large stimulus measures to boost the hard-hit economy. Bloomberg reported that some economists are expecting the regulators to cut policy rates or the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and also measures to support the country's troubled housing market. The People's Bank of China also lowered its 14-day reverse repurchase rate Monday.

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

Title: Twin Insurgency, Irregular War, and Oil Theft in Nigeria and Brazil: An Overview

Twin Insurgency, Irregular War, and Oil Theft in Nigeria and Brazil: An Overview Zachary Z. Horsington This article reviews the concept of twin insurgency and its constituent components of criminal insurgency and plutocratic insurgency in order to illuminate case studies of oil theft in Nigeria and Brazil. Gilman’s concept of twin insurgency represents a fusion of Sullivan’s concept of criminal insurgency, and Bunker’s concept of plutocratic insurgency.[1] Mutually, these concepts are essential to perceiving the threat environment associated with Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as both cases feature blurred criminality and politics conducted by a range of networked twin insurgent threat actors and their accomplices. As such, Gilman, Sullivan, and Bunker’s concepts concerning the criminal-plutocratic insurgent nexus will be examined, as well as a number of other corresponding irregular warfare theories, before the Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft case studies are investigated in detail. Crude Oil Barrells, Niger Delta, Stakeholder Democracy, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Twin Insurgency Sullivan’s theory of criminal insurgency describes a threat spectrum of criminal evolution between first generation ‘turf’ gangs, and third generation insurgent criminals, differentiated by their politicization, internationalization, and sophistication.[2] First generation gangs are highly territorial, localized, and limited in political scope, though they nonetheless “undermine the ability of the state to perform its legitimizing security and public service functions” through their low-level unlawfulness.[3] They are typically confined to neighborhoods, where their activities are not highly sophisticated, as compared to subsequent generations.[4] Second generation criminal organizations, on the other hand, attempt to coopt “bureaucrats and elected officials of a targeted political or security entity,” for profit motivated reasons.[5] “They may embrace a broader political agenda (albeit market focused), operate in a broader (sometimes multi-state) context, and conduct more sophisticated operations,” as they typically leverage emerging net-warrior capabilities.[6] As compared to first generation gangs, there is more expanded territorial and international reach, more complex internal self-organization, more diversified criminal activity, and typically an increase in violence and/or threats of violence against non-aligned individuals.[7] Finally, third generation entities seek exclusive zones of autonomy, to “de facto (in fact, whether legally or not) transform [themselves] into states-within-a-state,” which are able to leverage “authoritative allocation of values [and resources] in that social or physical terrain”.[8] Thus, “third generation gangs are mercenary/political gangs able to exert a combination of market and political influence to control territory”.[9] Their “evolved political and economic aims” contest, if necessary “the state monopoly of violence in a particular geographic space,” exploiting warlordism, “corruption, privatization of public goods and relativism of all kinds”.[10] Sophisticated criminal insurgents may also leverage near full-spectrum, all-domain capabilities to support their activities when required.[11] Gilman argues criminal insurgents are often fashioned from “the global disenfranchised,” and concurs with Sullivan that they espouse micro-sovereignties beyond mere profit motivation.[12] Such entities “resist, coopt, and route around states as they seek ways to empower and enrich themselves in the shadows of the global economy”.[13] Simultaneously they “deploy their resources to corrupt, coopt, or challenge incumbent political actors,” although the distinction between criminal and political violence is certainly blurred.[14] Conversely, Bunker describes plutocratic insurgents as “high net worth globalized elites,” who seek to insulate themselves from “public spaces and obligations—including taxation—and to maximize their ability to generate profits transnationally”.[15] Through predatory capitalism, corruption, public looting, the privatization of public spaces, stateless tax avoidance, and lobbied tax cuts, plutocratic insurgents evade both the law and accountability in luxurious techno-palaces.[16] Often in consort with criminal insurgents, such threat actors also seek to consolidate favorable transnational micro-sovereign enclaves.[17] Gilman observes that transnational plutocrats increasingly disassociate their personal accomplishments “from the success of the national societies in which they reside”.[18] While some individuals continue to perceive a “debt of obligation to the societies in which they have enriched themselves,” this is a scant and shrinking minority.[19] This has resulted in self-reinforcing positive feedback loops whereby: “plutocratic insurgents increasingly see no reason to contribute anything to their host societies and, indeed, actively contest the idea that citizenship comes with economic responsibilities”.[20] Thus, many are highly open to engaging in corruption, as they see no reflective value or responsibility in influencing efficacious and equitable state functions. Criminal and plutocratic insurgents “thrive in (and indeed try to foster) weak-state environments,” while at the same time their operations reinforce conditions of weakness.[21] They may migrate and attempt to reshape their environment to exclude competitors and insulate themselves from legal and public accountability. Plutocrats have insurgent potential to exploit transnational systems and local grievances overseas to expand their operations. The intersection, overlap, and symbiosis between criminal and plutocratic insurgency is a polycephaly Gilman describes through the concept of “twin insurgency”.[22] Both insurgents frequently cooperate and compete with each other to carve out de facto micro-sovereignties and zones of autonomy by disemboweling and decimating anyone’s capacities to constrain their activities. The final landscape consists of “diverse enclaves of heterogeneous political authority and of non-standardized social-service provisioning arrangements”.[23] As these non-standard arrangements materialize, “national and local authorities proliferate a variety of increasingly one-off exceptions to the general rules, incrementally traducing the liberal notion of equality before the law”.[24] The subsequent “proliferation of exceptional and unique micro sovereignties” enables further “jurisdictional arbitrage,” and non-state demands for “sovereign exceptions”.[25] The twin insurgency may also privately run select services and security traditionally provided by the state, and the civilians who live in these pseudo/semi-autonomous sectors of insurgent control “increasingly recognize the insurgents rather than the hollowed-out state as the real source of local power and authority”.[26] Ucko and Marks argue there may be merit in applying irregular warfare/counterinsurgency approaches to respond to sophisticated organized crime.[27] “The point is not to militarize further the response to organized crime. Instead, counterinsurgency in its theory is a political activity. Its contribution to consideration of organized crime is to cast the phenomenon as fueled by specific political and social drivers which must, alongside the criminal actors, also be addressed”.[28] While Ucko and Marks do not explicitly delineate the threshold whereby a criminal threat actor should be responded to with irregular war/fare approaches beyond traditional law enforcement, Sullivan, Bunker and Gilman’s arguments regarding criminal sovereignty interests transcending greed befittingly provide more clarity on this.[29] This demands the population be considered the center of gravity regarding warfare aspects, and sovereign dysfunction concerning the war itself.[30] Nonetheless, Ucko and Marks highlight how traditional organized crime responses have a “tendency to view the state unquestioningly as a provider, and its enemies as the threat,” which ignores “the very heart of the problem: a lack of government legitimacy and split loyalties among the population”.[31] They emphasize how legitimacy is not static, and instead “subjective, fluid, contextual, and contested; nothing can be taken for granted”.[32] Thus, “the state cannot in any way assume to hold legitimacy merely because it is duly constituted or has legal status”.[33] Ucko and Marks argue that political elites oftentimes are “more interested in retaining power and privilege than addressing the reasons for strife” when tackling irregular war/fare threats.[34] They note tendencies “to militarize even ‘whole-of-government’ endeavors,” and resource allocations in favor of kinetic operations in such situations, both of which realize actions disconnected from any “viable political process that gives military activity strategic meaning”.[35] Legitimacy can be shaped through coercion, although “sustaining cooperation is made easier if co-option also plays a role. Either way, gaining legitimacy means more than emotive affinity; it also involves a self-interested calculation that such loyalty is likely to pay off”.[36] Their arguments reflect “the artificiality of the state in many insurgency-threatened contexts,” and highlight how “in such contexts, the attempted imposition of the state can be deeply counterproductive”.[37] Ucko and Marks advise instead interfacing with “local structures that regulate life away from the state, so that they may be co-opted to benefit both center and periphery within the context of a loosely unified national compact,” as these “local institutions are often seen as more legitimate by the local population”.[38] Ucko and Marks champion “the state underwriting and empowering informal variations on the periphery, thereby satisfying local needs, empowering local political allies, and contributing to a desire to be part of, rather than resist, the state at the heart of it all”.[39] This is – of course – easier to write than realize. However, their arguments provide nuance in perceiving organized crime as “not an extension of a foreign body to the existing system, country or infrastructure,” but instead as a “product of a country’s history, its social conditions, its economic system, its political elite and its law enforcement regime”.[40] They remark that “this is not an invitation to moral relativism”.[41] Instead, their arguments offer a kaleidoscope to consider “why social contracts and political settlements are fueling organized crime,” in order to better “distinguish between crime as a coping mechanism and crime as exploitation,” while – of course – scrutinizing “the state’s role in enabling either”.[42] Doing so may enable better differentiation “between foot-soldiers, who in dysfunctional conditions can readily be replaced, and the organizers of criminal activity, who are more inaccessible and may even enjoy some level of state protection”.[43] Hackett argues that sovereignty defines irregular war.[44] While the population may be considered the center of gravity regarding the warfare, the dynamic construct of sovereignty should be considered the center of gravity for the war itself.[45] Previous discussions surrounding the motivations behind Irregular Warfare are highly dichotomous: there is ‘our’ political will and ‘theirs’.[46] Thus, Hackett’s arguments go beyond and consider dis/functional sovereignty as publicly dynamic and intersocial.[47] Hackett defines irregular war as: “the apotheosis of conflict between the people and the state, a violent dialectic between a faction and a sovereign expressed outside existing political institutions”.[48] He argues that the “intervening factor is sovereign dysfunction, and its presence in the conflict leads to irregular wars in which insurgents, conventional forces, and ­third-party interventions seek to preserve, destroy, or transform the state through organized political violence”.[49] Hackett describes sovereign dysfunction as “the disconnect between a state’s de jure (legally recognized) structure and its de facto behaviour, especially in the liminal space between what the people demand, what the state promises, and what is delivered”.[50] Counterinsurgency understands that there is no military solution, but instead a “military component to a larger strategy that is framed in political ends, flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert through the direction of a single, unified leadership and grand strategy”.[51] While this seems a basic understanding, Hackett observes throughout the Cold War and the Global War on Terror that thought, practice, and disconnection expose enduring institutional gaps associated with reconciling and interfacing ‘sovereignty’ and public opinion to extinguish irregular threat actors.[52] It is how McChrystal’s Task Force 714 were able to defeat al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) highly efficiently, but could not comprehend the genesis of Islamic State.[53] It is why Afghanistan is governed by the Taliban again today, and how Islamic State and al-Qaeda continue to gain territory across Africa and Asia. This discussion related to sovereignty and irregular war is all the more significant considering climate change and the climate-conflict nexus.[54] Schmidt’s concept of Discursive Institutionalism is particularly relevant here, as is Däniker’s concept of The Guardian Solider.[55] If state security apparatuses seriously want to better understand Irregular War/fare, in identifying the population and sovereignty as its center of gravity, they must function as more dynamic, socially discursive institutions. Lythgoe (2020) argues against hyper-decentralized command: it is not so much how centralized or decentralized your system is, but how dynamic it is in fluidly interpreting the right state, at the right time, for the right context.[56] The same elasticity is required to inform dialogic interactions in the public domain. However, this is all highly counterintuitive for state security apparatuses, which typically consider secrecy/transparency as binary, see public exposure negatively, and seek minimal partnership.[57] It is understood that the Information Revolution has transformed state/non-state capacities into self-organized, leveraged instruments of power in novel, efficient ways. The fields of Netwar and Chaoplexic Warfare examine this potential.[58] General Stanley McChrystal’s concepts of a ‘Team of Teams’ and F3EAD (i.e., find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, disseminate) represent applications of these ideas at the most sophisticated and classified level.[59] These theories accentuate complex adaptivity and decentralized operations, although they do not explain how the system should best treat independent feedback in the public domain and public partnership. Indeed, a critical short-coming concerning Information Operations (IO) identified by Lieutenant Colonel Norman E. Emery, of the US Army, is that it “neglects a key target of irregular warfare: the relevant population not categorized as adversarial”.[60] Security apparatus-public affairs currently function as a one-way street: operations are coordinated through public channels to either support ‘friendly’ forces or disadvantage ‘adversary’.[61] It is clear that the global threat environment has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. While many of the components of twin insurgency have existed long before Gilman, Sullivan and Bunker, their nexus, hybridization, and capacities today manifest in novel ways that challenge current institutional understanding, jurisdiction, and best practice.[62] As highlighted by Ucko and Marks and Hackett, institutional gaps concerning these threats are not unique to the past or any one nation: more clarity is needed and more discursive methods need to be tested.[63] All these theories are highly relevant to consider when examining Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as state responses have been, and continue to largely be, highly securitized/militarized. Nigeria functions as a mono-economy, depending on oil for over 95% of its export revenue, 6-9% of its GDP, and 70% of its total budget expenditure.[64] More than 90% of its oil production occurs in the Niger Delta Region and offshore.[65] The magnitude of oil theft in Nigeria is astronomical. Between 2009-2020, the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) found that 619.7m barrels of crude were lost due to theft and sabotage, valued at ₦16.25t (USD46.16b).[66] Security, repairs, and maintenance of damaged assets cost the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) ₦136b (USD91.48m) in 2023.[67] This is slightly less than the ₦147b (USD98.88m) they spent in 2022.[68] Unprecedented revenue losses were observed between 2019-2022 (USD2.1b, USD1.9b, USD7.2b and USD22.4b respectively).[69] In 2022, losses to theft were upwards of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd).[70] In 2023, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu cited loses of 400,000bpd to thieves.[71] Losses for this year are estimated at 470,000bpd, although many speculate the figures are much higher.[72] This equates to roughly USD700m lost to theft and vandalism each month.[73] In January 2023, Nigeria’s national oil production rate was 1.4m bpd (condensate and crude) [74] – 1.5m bpd was reported in February, falling to 1.2m bpd in March.[75] For the same three-month period this year (2024), the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) reported: 1.6m bpd, 1.5m bpd, and 1.4m bpd respectively (condensate and crude).[76] However, separating crude from condensate reveals: 1.32m bpd in February, 1.23m bpd in March, and 1.28m bpd in April.[77] While the situation may be slightly improving, Nigeria is nonetheless tight-rope walking its OPEC quota of 1.5m barrels per day, and clearly relying on condensate to veneer its production.[78] The state of Nigeria’s oil facilities is also dire. The Federal Government owns four refineries, although none are currently operational.[79] Two may be online by the end of this year.[80] Likewise, out of 57 Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) displayed by the NUPRC, about 33 are non-producing oil blocs.[81] Government security efforts offshore have been successful, although they have arguably displaced and entrenched threats onshore. The International Maritime Bureau indicates a decline in offshore criminality within the Gulf of Guinea since 2021.[82] Nigeria accounted for 17% of reported incidents in 2021, compared to 42% in 2020.[83] While no incidents were reported offshore in 2022, onshore oil theft that year was the worst Nigeria has ever experienced. Indeed, most incidents offshore in 2021 occurred in anchorages, ports and harbors, which should have signaled signs of threat displacement.[84] Considering Nigeria’s oil is produced mainly in the Niger Delta, it is here where the majority of oil theft occurs. The displacement of the pirates closer to the coastline and back ashore since 2022 has only magnified onshore oil theft and the diversity of threat actors involved. The graph below shows NNPC reported weekly cases of theft for the first few months of 2024.[85] Igbintade finds monthly case numbers oscillate around 1,337.[86] Udi (2024) finds the majority of reported theft cases occur in the Central and Eastern regions of the Niger Delta, with less and less occurring offshore in deep water.[87] Figure 1: NNPC Weekly Reported Theft Cases [85] The situation is so bad that Shell recently decided to completely divest its onshore assets and exclusively operate offshore.[88] While the Federal Government recently announced that Shell, Total Energies, and Exxon Mobil have committed to invest USD13.5b over the next two years to increase Nigerian oil output overall, a number of significant challenges need to be overcome before any robust security can be realized.[89] The 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom contributed to the outbreak of Nigeria’s Civil War, although Biafra’s oil wealth and Federal Government opportunism should not be understated as causes as well.[90] As argued by Okwelum, “Biafra’s independence would certainly have cut the nation’s [potential] oil wealth production in half,” which they argue influenced the Federal Government to extinguish any chance at Biafra secessionism.[91] Niger Delta communities continue to experience ethnic disenfranchisement, external exploitation, and livelihood insecurity. Niger Delta underdevelopment and persistent pollution is not merely a product of local criminality and oil theft: persistent federal mismanagement, corruption, and greed define national resource allocation and economic activity.[92] It has been estimated that more than 80% of Nigeria’s oil and gas revenues benefit just 1% of the populous.[93] Simultaneously, 50% of Nigeria has been designated impoverished by the World Bank, and 40% of those under age 25 in the Niger Delta Region are unemployed.[94] The recent removal of government fuel subsidies has not helped to remedy the situation.[95] In 2007, Nigeria’s unemployment rate was 6%; in 2019, it was 30%.[96] More generally, the Nigerian Federal Government has not harmonized economic development and reinvestment into the country’s surging population.[97] Currently at 200m, Nigeria’s population is set to double by 2050.[98] Current policy and practice cannot accommodate such growth. Recent protests highlight how government disenfranchisement is fervent nationwide. Nigerian food inflation stands at 40%, and according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the country already has the highest number of food insecure people on the planet (31.8 million).[99] The naira (currency) has lost 70% of its value against the US dollar over the past two years, following two devaluations.[100] Petrol prices are rising sharply, and electricity droughts continue to plague large swaths of the population.[101] National food, economic, and power insecurity will continue to magnify instability across the Niger Delta, unless more substantive internal transformation occurs. As such, Niger Delta grievances are likely to persist and deepen. Animosity is also directed against foreign oil corporations, who are perceived to be a neo-colonial presence in-country. They have long been considered by many Nigerians to be dishonest, exploitative, and/or ethnically/religiously prejudiced. In 1993, Shell operations were affected by over 100 communal disturbances, which contributed to the loss of approximately 12m barrels of oil, worth around ₦369b (USD248m).[102] Shell’s recent decision to move exclusively offshore reveals the company’s reduced risk appetite, although the decision is perhaps also influenced by the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in favor of Shell regarding a USD878m oil spill case, which had previously halted the sale of its onshore assets.[103] Local apathy towards foreign oil conglomerates also stems from their reputation (whether warranted or not) for environmental degradation. Corporate community development initiatives have also been lackluster and at times outright counterproductive. They have willing called for harsh security responses against demonstrators, and have paid out millions to co-opt local chiefs.[104] The formal authority of chiefs is still not officially constitutionally defined, and is currently being reviewed.[105] Conflict has spiked before, and will continue to do so, until underlying dysfunctional sovereignty and the Niger Delta’s underdevelopment are addressed. Hundreds of oil facilities were vandalized between 1998-2003, and ethnic militias escalated between 2005-2010 to taking hostages, detonating cars, and attacking installations on-land and at-sea.[106] Losses in revenue related to direct attacks against Nigerian oil infrastructure cost the Federal Government USD6.8b between 1999-2004, and losses sharply increased again around 2006/7.[107] Bish et al. highlight that, while amnesty programs were introduced after the 2008 surge in Niger Delta violence, persistent low intensity conflict since 2012 indicates unaddressed and simmering grievances and tensions.[108] Indeed, the amnesty program itself has been scrutinized for its inconsistent Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) principles, lack of supplementary employment for many militants, sporadic salaries, discrimination, and generous stipends to select militant leadership.[109] The failure of demobilization and youth movements has further augmented the influence of cults, militia, and street gangs.[110] Thus, as argued by Okwelum, the disenfranchised communities of the Niger Delta region perceive oil theft to be a “display of local expertise and an entrepreneurial free market response to local economic dysfunction, chronic energy shortages, and government’s failure to deliver on basic public services,” rather than a criminal activity.[111] Historical legacy, underdevelopment, external exploitation and environmental devastation continue to fuel local resentments which transliterate into criminality, namely oil theft, in an attempt to alleviate “their impoverished condition”.[112] While many Nigerian Criminal Armed Groups (CAGs) espouse separatism or flaunt ethnic and religious sentiments, considering the dire economic situation in the Niger Delta, significant scrutiny is required to decipher and distinguish socio-political interests from financial motivations. Such distinction is necessary to discriminate criminal insurgents from organized criminals. While it is clear that dysfunctional sovereignty is apparent in the Niger Delta Region, clearer differentiation between these threat actors is necessary to better tailor state response. As argued by Okwelum: “The face of the jerry-can-wielding-rural-poor is not the face of oil theft.” Considering the flagrant and widespread corruption, “they are [merely] the foot soldiers paraded before the public as a decoy and deceit”.[113] As argued by Katsina, and Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda, structural, socio-economic, and political imbalances predominantly fuel Nigeria’s national security threats.[114] Until such factors are adequately addressed, twin insurgency will continue to thrive in Nigeria. Nigerian oil theft is not technologically sophisticated. Basic hot and cold tapping and scooping practices are widespread. Tanker interdiction occurs in littoral waters, and so-called artisanal refineries are pervasive across the Niger Delta Region. A spokesperson for Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited, a Nigerian private security company led by former militant leader Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo), recently said that: “Most of the [stolen] oil is locally refined from the Niger Delta. A vessel can bring 10,000tons from Europe, take 60,000tons from Niger Delta, and falsify the documents, claiming it is from Europe”.[115] Trucks are also used to transport stolen oil to “neighboring Cameroon, Niger Republic, Chad and so on. Nigerian oil goes everywhere”.[116] Oil is stored in sacks for handling purposes and camouflage.[117] To pass through the abundance of road blocks in Nigeria, a single number plate will be legitimately registered for transit, and forgeries of the relevant documentation will be used by multiple trucks.[118] No sooner is one tap or distillery shutdown before multiple replacements appear, “in a few hours”.[119] Moreover, “you will find women and children inside the bush working and contributing their share to the oil theft”.[120] Thieves often install CCTV around their taps to provide early warning against security forces.[121] Threat actors have attacked oil facilities with light weapons and explosives; industry personnel have been kidnapped; and many are implicated in egregious inter-ethnic/religious/community human rights abuses. Coordinated industrial action has also occurred. Threat actors are typically armed with indigenously produced small arms, although looting government stores and smuggling have provided more sophisticated weapons. In 2021, The Organized Crime Index ranked Nigeria far higher than the West African average (8 vs 5.5).[122] The Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Boko Haram are both known to loot government stockpiles, and the Cameroonian border towards the Southeast is known to be assailable.[123] Simultaneously, Nigeria’s indigenous arms manufacturing industry is ever-expanding. Indigenously produced models are typically four times cheaper than imported pieces, and a rudimentary pistol can cost as little as ₦3,500 (USD2.4).[124] For perspective, Nigeria’s official minimum wage is ₦70,000 (USD43) per month, although it is likely to be much less in practice. In 2022, a Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons estimated that 60% of illegal arms in circulation in Southeast Nigeria are artisanal pieces.[125] Nigeria’s artisanal light arms production is now a fully-fledged local industry, which will significantly complicate future DDR. Irregular threat actor groups associated with oil theft typically operate as cellular networks rather than as hierarchies.[126] Nearly all threat groups are resilient to leadership decapitation as well, as they operate cells, frequently referred to as ‘houses’ or ‘decks’.[127] Most oil thieves do not associate themselves with a specific threat actor group. Group affiliation and overt marketing typically attracts government attention and fierce response. Thus, most oil thieves affiliate informally across ethnic, religious, and community lines. Groups may be temporarily formed or revived, and criminals may participate across multiple groups and localities. Despite the opaque threat environment a few notable groups may be differentiated as insurgent criminals. Other, purely profit-motivated groups exist too, as do other less publicized separatist movements involved in oil theft. Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB): A separatist group founded in 2012 that seeks to re-establish an independent Biafran state.[128] The group commands significant influence over Nigeria’s ethnic Igbo community and claims resource/land rights within Biafra’s historic borders (present-day Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Cross River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Rivers, Imo States, Nigeria).[129] Mazi Chika Edoziem (previously deputy) is its new leader, as Nnamdi Kanu (leader since 2013 and British citizen) is currently imprisoned by the Department of State Services (DSS).[130] The group’s spokesman is Emma Powerful. Dr. Fredrick Onyeali and Onyekachukwu Ezemba are the original founders of the current IPOB movement. The group operates the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Black Marines as security forces. ESN is quite a sophisticated paramilitary entity, evidenced by a prison break in Imo State in 2021, which freed 1,800 IPOB inmates.[131] The group is still very active, and recently claimed the lives of six civilians and five soldiers in Aba.[132] The military responded by launching a raid which attempted to arrest those responsible, although six IPOB were killed in a firefight.[133] In April, 2021, IPOB formally allied itself with the Ambazonia Governing Council (AGovC) and the Ambazonia Defence Forces.[134] The alliance was denounced by the Interim Government of Ambazonia as well as by other Biafran separatist groups. Niger Delta Avengers (NDA): Openly seeks to cripple oil production.[135] Threatened ‘Operation Humble’ in June 2021, a campaign of violence against the NFG, as well as the destruction of oil installations, although no attacks were publicly attributed to them after this statement.[136] Field Commander Tu-ere, (AKA Queen of the Creeks) was assigned to lead the operation, who was previously involved in bombing the Chevron Valve offshore platform in May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line in June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline in July, 2016. Known to operate in Ondo, Bayelsa, Edo, Delta, Imo, Abia and Akwa Ibom States, Nigeria.[137] In June last year, NDA spokesperson Mudoch Agbinibo called for: “The international community to come and support the restoration of our rights to peaceful self-determination… Since the amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914 to date, our resources have been used to sustain the political administrative livewire of Nigeria to the exclusion of the Niger Delta… We want our resources back to restore the essence of human life in our region for generations to come because Nigeria has failed to do that. The world should not wait until we go the Sudan way”.[138] Unyekisong Akwa Ibom (UAI): Comprises former members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the Niger Delta Volunteer Force, Movement for the Actualization of the Niger Delta Republic, Niger Delta People’s Salvation Force, Niger Delta Avengers, Niger Delta Liberation Force and Niger Delta Movement for Justice and Niger Delta Warrior.[139] Akwa Ibom indigenes argue militant amnesty programs have consistently discriminated against them.[140] UAI views government amnesty/peace initiatives in the Niger Delta as inherently discriminatory and enablers of corruption. The group seeks to secure oil facilities within their territory, and issued ultimatums to the Nigerian government in 2021 and 2022, although no action followed.[141] UAI is believed to still be led by General Dede Udofia and Major Ibanga Ekang. Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND): Despite the group having officially dissolved, it is understood that factions/ethno-religious groups previously under the umbrella of MEND continue to operate independently to this day. Other groups that have previously attacked/threatened oil operations which may be active or have members acting autonomously: Niger-Delta People’s Volunteer Force; Red Egbesu Water Lions; Joint Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Red Squad; Niger-Delta Greenland Justice Mandate; Niger-Delta Youth Movement; Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People; Federated Niger-Delta Ijaw Communities; Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Civil Society Coalition; Coalition of Niger-Delta Agitators; Bakassi Strike Force; Niger Delta Vigilante; the Icelanders; and the Outlaws.[142] This list is not exhaustive. Cult groups are also influential, leveraging “whole communities, churches, schools- universities, secondary schools and even primary schools, government positions and political structures in the Niger Delta”.[143] Both cults and militia function strong traditional spiritual elements, “mainly based on the revival and strong influence of the Egbesu deity in Ijaw communities”.[144] Finally, many of these threat actors are sophisticated net-warriors as they involve themselves in complex and robust networks, however they may not be technologically elaborate and benefit from the ancillary operational security. Bala argues: “Nigerian security is influenced by a garrison military mentality”.[145] Joab-Peterside also argues that the “state’s approach to security is dominated by the character of deterrence exhibited by unrestrained willingness to show maximum force at the slightest hint of insecurity”.[146] Nigeria’s history of colonialism and 36 years of post-independence military dictatorship have influenced a status quo whereby “force is used for punitive rather than preventative and corrective purposes of civil law enforcement and justice delivery”.[147] Despite over two decades of democracy in Nigeria, its armed forces continue to preponderate over the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) regarding internal security operations. This is despite the NPF being “constitutionally created for and mandated for the task”.[148] The armed forces have displayed steadfast interest in managing internal security operations, oftentimes directly interfering with police efforts.[149] Simultaneously, the military persistently laments how overstretched its forces are and how distracted it is from its primary constitutional responsibility: defending Nigeria’s territorial integrity.[150] The tendency to militarize internal security response has resulted in significant internal distrust and rivalry between the armed forces and its civilian counterparts.[151] Agencies operate as silos and intelligence is more often hoarded, rather than shared.[152] Despite an inordinate amount of disbursement towards the armed forces and numerous kinetic and non-kinetic operations in the Niger Delta Region, oil theft and criminal insurgency remain entrenched. As argued by Hackett, there should only be a “military component” to a holistic grand strategy, “flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert,” which maneuvers a political end.[153] Nigeria’s military has dominated internal security operations since its independence, although the threat environment in the Niger Delta Region has not much improved. It is time to consider alternative methods and more efficacious and equitable federal resource allocation. The severity of the security situation in Southeastern Nigeria has seen the emergence of hybrid sovereign, non-state (often armed) groups in response to the criminality and weaponary. As mentioned previously, former Niger Delta warlord Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo) leads Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited. In August, 2023 Tantita was awarded a one-year contract worth ₦48b (USD32.3m) to provide security services to the Niger Delta Region.[154] This is not the first time the Federal Government has allegedly been contractually involved with Tompolo, as it bought 20 maritime patrol vessels worth over ₦15b (USD103.4m) from Global West Vessel Specialist Limited in 2012, a company widely believed to be owned by him.[155] Tantita currently claims to oversee 9m of its own staff, 38m community youth, and 22m intelligence agents.[156] There appears a clear conflict of interest, or at the very least collusion. Yet, Tompolo’s efforts have attracted praise, and his security forces have displayed successes in-field. Other private security entities do exist, such as Galaxy Security Services.[157] State governments have also established their own hybrid sovereign organizations to maintain security. In January 2020, all six Southern Nigerian states united to establish the Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) (a.k.a. Operation Àmò̩té̩kùn, i.e., Operation ‘to kill as fast as a cheetah’ in Yorùbá).[158] Àmò̩té̩kùncontinues to operate across all Southwestern Nigerian states except Lagos, with personnel comprising of “vigilantes, local hunters, community youths, farmers and menial workers”.[159] In April 2021, Ebonyi State setup the Ebube Agu Security apparatus.[160] This was formally disbanded by Nigerian courts early 2023 after evidence suggested the group was involved in “human rights abuses, extortions, illegal arrests and [illegal] use of fire arms”.[161] State governments command no constitutional power to arm indigenous security networks they form, and thus, many groups are in direct breach of Nigeria’s separation of powers and its monopoly over violence.[162] As argued by Bish et al. and Joab-Peterside, many of these state-level hybrid sovereign entities are politicized in the run-up to elections to support or deter certain candidates.[163] This not only undermines public confidence regarding the efficacy of the existence of such groups, but also erodes Nigeria’s democratic process, and contributes to escalating violence. Hybrid sovereign/private actors can provide stability if they are properly overseen and managed within legal frameworks. The presence of so many such actors, and the legacies of misuse, clearly dilute the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence and erodes Nigeria’s sovereignty. The NPF is significantly impeded in its ability to respond to threats associated with systematic oil theft in Nigeria. It functions as a federal police force. As argued by Baje, NPF officers are “inadequately trained, live in dilapidated barracks, and are poorly paid”.[164] At the same time, they are understaffed and/or are diverted to conduct personal private protection. The NPF officially employed over 370,000 officers in August 2023. Nigeria’s population stands at approximately 220m.[165] The International Association of Chiefs of Police recommended ratio of officers to citizens is 3.4:1000, and United Nations’ stands at 1:450.[166] Nigeria currently sits around 1:600, which is insufficient considering the domestic security situation. As argued by Ibrahim, this statistic is also undermined by the fact that around 150,000 of the officers are “engaged in VIP protection, rather than routine policing”.[167] While many Inspector Generals have committed to ceasing rented private protection services from NPF officers, the widespread practice continues.[168] A significant community policing initiative was launched in September 2020, whereby the government allocated ₦13b (USD35m) to absorb 10,000 new constables.[169] Not much has been gained from this, as underlying issues associated with NPF have not been rectified; corruption and mismanagement continue to be widespread; and the oil theft situation has not improved. As argued by Nigerian senator Orji Uzor Kalu, tapping and illegal refining “only make up for a small portion of the theft,” although their “environmental impact is vast”.[170] As argued by Senator Kalu, Okwelum and Tantita spokesmen, the plutocratic insurgency associated with coordinating and managing Nigerian oil theft represents a significant threat to national security.[171] Okwelum highlights there is a tendency to “inflate the quantity stolen in order to magnify the enormity of the scourge and justify the need for deploying the armed forces,” or to “minimize the quantity stolen in order to attenuate the adverse publicity it exposes the industry internationally and collaterally and in order to attract direct foreign investment,” when it suits the “state-oil-complex”.[172] Simultaneously, as argued by Garuba, the presidency of Ibrahim Babangida (1986-1993) also entrenched nepotistic Federal appointments regarding Nigerian oil officials who supervise the industry.[173] As argued by Moses, on the one hand “corrupt resident oil authority officials allow for the successful tapping of oil pipelines,” and on the other “the Nigerian security forces or militant organizations offer guided escorts for the transportation of stolen refined crude oil products”.[174] Indeed, security forces have frequently been accused of “facilitating the disappearance of captured vessels and re-appropriated sale of seized products to foreign markets”.[175] While the Nigerian Navy may report historic destructions of illegal oil refineries, as argued by Bish et al., oil thieves and site owners merely interpret crackdowns as “attempts to pressure them into paying bribes”.[176] Former Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, openly accused the Nigerian military of actively and systematically colluding with oil thieves, and Human Rights Watch cites widespread corruption across all Nigeria’s service branches.[177] On-land state security operations are known to be plagued with corruption too. For example, the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, personally witnessed state security forces associated with ‘Operation Positive Identification’ collect illegal tolls at a checkpoint along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway.[178] Such extortion justifiably ignites public outcry, and continues to undermine public perceptions of the Armed Forces. As argued by Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, a former commissioner in Ondo State: “[Nigerian] oil theft is not for the poor, it is an extensive racket involving the military, security apparatchiks, politicians, dubious industrial moguls and the oil companies”.[179] Nigerian plutocratic insurgency is naturally obscure, although plenty of admonitions exist, and persisting legislative gaps and elastic legal instruments continue to appear. Both the Ayo Irikefe Commission of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Shagari against the Obasanjo administration regarding missing oil assets worth ₦2.8b (USD1.9m) – and the Pius Okigbo Panel of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Abacha against the Babangida administration following the post-Gulf War oil bounce of the 1990s – were obfuscated and subdued by corruption.[180] Formal transparency and accountability measures associated with oil theft and federal inquiry have not improved at all. The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mallam Sanusi Lamido, has cited that between January 2012 and July 2013, the NNPC itself was defrauded of 594m barrels of crude valued at approximately USD65.3b, and was only able to recover approximately USD15.5b (24% of the total value) of this lost oil, therefore failing to account for roughly USD49.8b.[181] A more recent controversy involved the Deep Blue Project (DBP), an integrated maritime awareness scheme, led by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). DBP was funded from the Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF).[182] The CVFF was established under the Coastal and Inland Shipping Act (a.k.a. the Cabotage Act of 2003) to foster indigenous tonnage to work within Nigerian waters.[183] Two percent of the CVFF was allocated to Nigerian ship owners so that they could borrow money from the fund at single digit interest rates for littoral cabotage trading.[184] However, in December 2021, a member of the House of Representatives accused NIMASA and then-Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi of diverting USD195m from the CVFF to fund the DBP without House approval.[185] This is despite the fact that no ship owner has successfully accessed the CVFF since its inception.[186] Extra-budgetary expenditures known as ‘security votes’ are also known to be flagrantly abused.[187] As highlighted by Bala, these funds are “not subject to the government executives’ declaration and not under the scrutiny of the public or even the established government auditing institutions of the anti-corruption agencies”.[188] These pseudo slush funds operate formally and informally, and are used to realize political and personal objectives. Transparency International exposed these ‘security votes’ account for around USD670m annually.[189] As argued by Bala, this dwarfs the annual international security assistance Nigeria receives. It is more than the Nigerian Army’s budget, more than the Nigerian Navy and Air Force’s annual budgets combined, and exceeds 70% of the Nigerian Police Force’s annual budget.[190] More transparent frameworks are necessary in order to restore public confidence, and more impartial resource allocation is desperately needed. Ex parte law is also brazenly abused, with the use of emergency judicial decisions in legal cases. Convener of the Transparent Bar Initiative, Douglas Ogbankwa, has faulted some law enforcement agencies regarding their frequently arbitrary and coercive use.[191] He highlighted that many ex parte motions “were done without the knowledge of the account holders, who should be aware of the situation in order to defend themselves”.[192] Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, also recently stated that the abuse of ex parte orders in political cases by judges should be curbed.[193] “To curb it, it is imperative that the National Judicial Council exercises stringent oversight. We recommend prompt and decisive punishment for judges who are found to abuse their authority in this manner”.[194] Significant legislative gaps also exist. Both Nigeria’s Terrorist Acts (2011 and 2013) lack a national definition for terrorism, and the Federal Government’s stance regarding negotiation with threat actors is not clear.[195] Likewise, no laws currently regulate the management of ill-gotten-gains associated with kidnapping and piracy following criminal capture.[196] Seized illegal proceeds are always forfeited to the Federal Government. Pervasive and systematic nepotism also undermines rule of law and due process. As highlighted by Bala, government/military appointments are typically defined across ethno-religious and political lines rather than meritocracy.[197] Such practices “breed disregard for the rule of law,” and jeopardize interagency synergy.[198] Prevalent corruption across Nigeria continues to create dysfunctional sovereignty, which will continue to encourage irregular threat actors. Nigeria currently does not operate State Police, although discussion regarding their formation is occurring in government. While some local police forces did exist in the 1960s, all were either eventually absorbed into the NPF or dismantled following military dictatorship.[199] The topic of state police has been fiercely contested, as many believe they should have been reinstated in 1999, following the end of military dictatorship.[200] House of Assembly speakers from across all 36 states recently announced their support for the proposal in a communiqué.[201] State legislators still need to endorse an official amendment to be passed onto the National Assembly.[202] However, two-thirds of Nigeria’s National Assembly must endorse it, followed by the President, for it to be realized.[203] President Bola Tinubu has championed and campaigned for State Police for decades, and thus he is unlikely to reject it.[204] Noticeable supporters include Senate President Godswill Akpabio and former President Goodluck Jonathan.[205] Although, while the Minister of Police Affairs, Senator Ibrahim Gaidam has shown his support, the Inspector General of Police directly contradicts him.[206] Many have argued for a long time that the adoption of state police would enable more effective and efficient policing.[207] Advocates highlight current limitations regarding the highly centralized command associated with the NPF. Nwogwugwu and Kupoluyi explain that a federally centralized police system alienates police as an institution and a service from rural communities.[208] As argued by Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda: “The peculiarity of the security challenges of each state can be better managed by the officers who understands the language, geography and the peculiar security challenge of the people they would be policing”.[209] Considering Nigeria is home to over 300 ethnic groups who vary across a range of social, religious, economic, and geographic factors, Tony also highlights the need for “a policing model that is adaptable and sensitive to local contexts”.[210] It is this line of argument, focused around “local exclusiveness”, which Senator Ibrahim Gaidam, Minister of Police Affairs, champions too. While states currently administer their own magistrates, high courts, assemblies and legislators, they do not command the concomitant powers to police their own territories.[211] While this does consolidate the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence, state sovereignty is affected, and the NPF remain spread thin across 774 localities commanded from Abuja.[212] Conversely, ex-Lagos police commissioner, Abubakar Tsav, stated that the “establishment of state police will signal the beginning of the disintegration of the country,” as he believes that state governments would deploy their new forces “against their perceived political opponents”.[213] In 2018 he argued that politicians “are not civilized enough and tolerant of opposing views and cannot preside over a competent and impartial police force”.[214] His sentiments have been echoed by many, including the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kayode Egbetokun, although such arguments often extend to also include ethnic, community, and religious adversaries too.[215] As observed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Abbas Tajudeen, “there is a palpable fear among our citizens – a fear of potential tyranny and the misuse of police powers if control is devolved to the state level”.[216] Indeed, the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) in 1958 and the Willink Commission both opposed regional police on these grounds.[217] Alternatively, Emeritus Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Ben Okolo, and the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi all suggest mending the dire state of the NPF first.[218] This includes hiring more officers, improving their welfare package, and enhancing overall NPF capabilities and infrastructure. Simultaneously, the Assistant Inspector General suggested merging the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Commission (NSCDC) and the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) under the command of the NPF.[219] State police could very well be misused, and punishing such practices would represent a new responsibility for the NPF. Considering that the current separation of powers is murky, appropriate transparency and accountability measures could enhance state-federal cooperation, facilitate more autonomous state level security, and ultimately contribute to healthier national unity. In order to tackle the twin insurgency, the Federal Government must not merely continue to invest in improving its police and military, but also seriously consider more substantive and equitable socioeconomic development and DDR in the Niger Delta Region. Romsom argues that both Nigeria and Brazil “show characteristics of the state as smuggler model”.[220] While criminal insurgency is not so prevalent in Brazil, as the majority of criminals stealing oil do not overtly espouse sovereignty aspirations, plutocratic insurgency is nonetheless rife. Oil theft has evolved into a conspicuous threat in Brazil since around 2014, when it reported a single incident.[221] In 2016, 73 incidents were reported.[222] Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), the Brazilian state oil company observed that most of the oil theft that year occurred on the São Paulo-Rio de Janeiro axis, which is where five of the company’s largest refineries are located.[223] Above and below ground, hot and cold taps are erected by Brazilian oil thieves, much like in Nigeria, although the quantities they steal is markedly less significant.[224] In November 2023, approximately 30,000 liters of stolen fuel were intercepted by police, taken from the São Paulo-Brasília (Osbra) pipeline, which supplies the International Airport of Brasilia.[225] Four men were arrested, and around R$780,000 (USD138,000) worth of damage was inflicted.[226] Killings have been linked to oil theft operations, and there are indications that ‘turf’ wars exist between gangs regarding where their taps reside.[227] A few incidents have caused spills too.[228] Much like in Nigeria, criminals use tanker and water trucks to smuggle stolen fuel to concealed artisanal refineries, after which it is sold at illegal service stations or small-town, streetside vendors.[229] Brazil’s Federal Highway Police have increased the number of roadblocks they operate between Rio and São Paulo, although as observed in Nigeria, these may be easily circumvented by organized criminals.[230] Brazilian groups have previously generated false cargo invoices to deceive police.[231] Roadside hijackings of fuel trucks also regularly occur, with around ten cases a week occurring between the Gabriel Passos Refinery and the Ring Road.[232] Drivers do not typically suffer any injuries during these incidents, although the frequency with which they occur is increasing.[233] Brazilian law enforcement has responded and successfully dismantled many gangs associated with oil theft. Indeed, Transpetro, the logistics unit of Petrobras, reported a 60% decline in fuel theft at its pipes in São Paulo in 2020.[234] In June, three full and four empty trucks were seized in Fazenda Garcia, in Guapimirim, in the Baixada Fluminense, following an anonymous tip, which cited seeing 15 armed men.[235] A 100,000 liters of stolen fuel were seized, and one man was eventually detained.[236] Likewise, in May 2024 an adulterated fuel laboratory was dismantled by police, in Dias d'Ávila, Salvador, Bahia.[237] 600,000 liters of adulterated fuel were seized, including diesel, gasoline and ethanol, which was likely destined to be resold to gas stations.[238] Ten trucks and three fixed tanks were found (storing cargo worth R$3.3m [USD584,000]), as well as suction machines, hoses, gloves, dye, fuel symbology plates, samples of fuel types, and accounting documents.[239] Another adulterated fuel laboratory was also previously shut down by police in Feira de Santana, in January 2024.[240] Overall, theft overall costs Transpetro over R$150m (USD28.2m) a year.[241] Gangs may be quickly formed and dismantled, and may steal millions in less than a year.[242] A police operation in July 2023, which served 47 search and seizure warrants across Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Paraná exposed one such group.[243] Three chiefs oversaw the organization: one was responsible for scouts and drivers; another managed logistics and clandestine fuel derivation and extraction; and one was the financial director.[244] Specialists also included tap installers, recruiters who targeted professionals who worked mainly on oil platforms, welders, truck suppliers and false invoice forgers.[245] Harsher penalties were recently introduced specifically concerning fuel theft. In April, Brazil’s Infrastructure Commission passed bill 828/2022, which increased the punishment regarding theft of petroleum or derivatives, natural gas, hydrated ethyl alcohol, fuel, or other fuel fluids from four to ten years imprisonment, plus a fine.[246] Receipt of such illicit products will earn the same punishment.[247] Senator Alessandro Vieira also partially accepted an amendment proposed by Senator Luis Carlos Heinze to include biofuels as well.[248] The rapporteur added that the storage of such illegal fuel products may also be considered a crime.[249] Nonetheless, oil thieves in Brazil are markedly white-collar. Indeed, as argued by Slattery, Brazilian criminals “have infiltrated the four largest gasoline chains in Brazil,” whereby they are estimated to control “hundreds, if not thousands,” of service stations.[250] Paulo Miranda, head of the industry group Fecombustíveis, cites that First Capital Command (one of Brazil's most notorious organized criminal groups) controls approximately 300 gas stations in São Paulo state alone, which accounts for 3% of Brazil’s pumps.[251] Oil grafting at stations is lucrative, and Instituto Combustive Legal estimates the illicit industry to be valued at around R$23b (USD4.2b) a year.[252] Many groups also fence illicit petroleum products through asphalt companies too.[253] Oil criminals in Brazil also exploit petroleum tax regimes between states, as they vary widely region-to-region.[254] Ethanol tax in Rio de Janeiro is 32%, compared to 13% in neighboring São Paulo.[255] This creates huge incentive to conduct criminality across state lines. Brazilian think tank Fundação Getúlio Vargasestimated that criminals reaped approximately R$7.2b (USD1.3b) in 2019 through such fuel tax evasion alone.[256] Oil theft in Mexico has divulged into a glaringly similar situation to Nigeria, whereby billions of dollars of oil are unaccounted for each year by the state oil company Pemex. Colombia and Venezuela are also affected, although to a lesser degree. In Colombia, siphoned oil is increasingly refined into “pategrillo,” a low-grade fuel fabricated at illegal refineries used to produce cocaine.[257] Smith observes a positive relationship in Colombia between increased cocaine production and increased oil theft.[258] Considering that at least 22 organized crime groups operate across approximately one-quarter of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, it is likely that a similar dynamic functions in Brazil.[259] A myriad of similar, different, and competing hybrid sovereign and private security actors function policing across Brazil.[260] As argued by Durão, Larkins, and Argentin, the Brazilian federal police have not effectively regulated state branches regarding the widespread practice of ‘bico’, whereby police establish or participate in private security. Through a series of interviews, they discovered that such practices are “not only tolerated, but even encouraged by police superiors”.[261] “Rather than seeing the blurring between different fields of security and police and crime as signs of incomplete democratization or incomplete regulation,” Durão, Larkins and Argentin (2023) observe jurisdictional ambiguity as an “intentional productive force which allows for material gain for key actors, in this case police officers themselves”.[262] Nonetheless, they argue that “the confusion between public and private policing for some may essentially mean earning extra money, but for many others it constitutes an endless extension of power, violence, entrepreneurship and political influence”.[263] Such is the case in Nigeria as well, and both the Brazilian and the Nigerian government must do more to better regulate these non-state security forces to ameliorate public confidence, and/or strengthen and consolidate official state forces so that there may be no need for extraneous redundancies. Transparency International attributed a score of 36/100 (i.e., 0=highly corrupt and 100=very clean) to Brazil in 2023, placing it 104/180 on its global corruption perceptions index.[264] In 2012, Brazil scored 43/100, an all-time historic peak, just before the massive Lava Jato corruption scandal enveloped the state oil company Petrobras, and numerous contractors and politicians.[265] Brazil’s overall corruption is incrementally worsening, which will likely exacerbate oil theft across the country. Its security architecture has also been observed to be significantly affected by a lack of transparency, police brutality, machismo, and prejudice toward certain minority groups.[266] Simultaneously, Milícia have existed across Brazil for more than half a century.[267] Their current form spawned from Rio de Janeiro’s favelas in the late 1990s and early 2000s, under the pretense of residential narco protection.[268] Predominantly comprised of active-duty and retired police officers, milícia extort rent from communities under their assumed control.[269] In 2013, it was found that across approximately 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, 45% were controlled by milícia organizations and 37% by narcos.[270] Milícia are known to control telecommunication towers, internet cables, and TV providers, so much so, a special police task force had to be created in October 2020 to respond.[271] By May 2021, over 20 clandestine internet and cable TV providers were ceased and over 600 milícia members were arrested.[272] Losses to the economy were estimated near R$1.1b (USD195m).[273] 26 telecommunication masts across Rio de Janeiro were also compromised that year.[274] Milícia are known to participate in oil theft and the sale of bootleg product to service stations.[275] As argued by Sullivan and Bunker, “the state-militia nexus amplifies criminal competition for control yielding a hybrid form of criminal-political violence.[276] Information regarding corruption associated with Brazilian oil theft is scarce. Although in 2017, Brazilian police suspected insider threats in Petrobras to have helped setup illegal taps near the Duque de Caxias refinery, as they were observed to be precisely engineered.[277] Moreover, Marcelo Queiroz dos Anjos, a captain in the Military Police, was the head of an oil theft gang which operated in the municipalities of the Baixada Fluminense.[278] Although he surrendered to police in 2021, which accelerated the demise of his organization, the group nonetheless stole a total of 169,500 liters of oil and caused Transpetro/Petrobras a loss of about R$2m (USD354,000).[279] Police eventually arrested four others and served 14 search and seizure warrants.[280] Another gang dismantled in July 2023 involved three brothers, two military police officers, and an outsourced Transpetro employee.[281] The group had managed to inflict losses worth around R$1b (USD175m).[282] Considering that oil theft continues in Brazil, and the scale of influence organized criminals command across it, it is highly likely that insider threats persist. Petrobras is also a state-owned entity, so it is likely that insider threats extend into the Brazilian government as well, as Lava Jato revealed. Oil theft in Nigeria is dire, and the situation in Brazil reveals symptoms previously observed in Mexico. There is no universal response to threats associated with oil theft, although both the Brazilian and Nigerian governments can do more to remedy dysfunctional sovereignty and underdevelopment. Plenty of information is available regarding Nigerian oil theft, although more transparency, accountability, and enforcement around the issue is necessary. The prospect of State Police represents an exciting, albeit precarious opportunity for Nigeria, as their presence may be used to refocus state responses around more indigenous law enforcement, rather than predominantly kinetic military activities. Nonetheless, all Nigerian security forces must demonstrate better behaviour regarding discrimination, brutality, corruption, and extra-judicial abuse in order to mend public trust and de jure authority more generally. Industrial actors must also rehabilitate community sentiment regarding environmental degradation and exploitation. The Patriotic Liberation Front in Niger also recently attacked the PetroChina-funded Niger-Benin crude oil pipeline, paralyzing the pipeline and killing six, to coerce the cancellation of a USD400m China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) oil deal signed in April.[283] Onshore oil investment across West Africa will continue to be stifled if the security situation more generally does not improve, and the Nigerian government should be wary of how regional oil related instabilities influence violence and theft dynamics across the Niger Delta, and vice versa. Information regarding oil theft in Brazil as a whole is scare, although it is clear that elements of Gilman’s twin insurgency function at the pipes, the pumps, and among Brazil’s plutocratic elite. State security forces, much like Nigerian ones, have frequently dismantled oil theft gangs, criminal extractive tools, and illegal refineries, although the problem persists. Both countries are observed to operate/allow hybrid sovereign and/or private security contractors to combat oil theft. While a few have proven themselves, the patchwork of security actors involved nonetheless undermines and complicates state sovereignty, its monopoly on violence, and creates jurisdictional ambiguities. Regulation rather than standardization/absorption may realize more efficacious and fair security, as positive aspects of local tailoring may be exploited under adequate legal frameworks and oversights, although this is easier said than done. Nonetheless, all security sector reform must to be paired with significant government-community dialog and socio-economic development in order to dismantle environmental drivers which influence crime and insurgency. The Nigerian government has a lot of work to do before it can claim symbiosis with Niger Delta Communities, assuage foreign investors, and dethrone Algeria to once again become the leading African oil producer. Likewise, the Brazilian government must also do more to prevent the oil theft situation from deteriorating into that observed in Mexico.[284] Endnotes [1] Robert J.
