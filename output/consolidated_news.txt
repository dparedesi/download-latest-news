Banks once shunned crypto custody; now they’re racing to tokenize trillions in cash and securities. The quiet rebuild is underway, and it’s happening inside the balance sheets of Goldman, Citi, and BlackRock. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Wall Street’s biggest balance sheets are quietly rebuilding the crypto stack under the banner of tokenization and custody. What began as a defensive stance toward digital assets is turning into an infrastructure shift: bringing fund administration, cash management, and settlement onto blockchain rails that look more like BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirect platform than a typical crypto exchange. Since late summer, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have taken tokenized money market funds live, Citi has positioned itself as a tokenization agent and custodian on Switzerland’s SDX exchange, and BlackRock has doubled down on the thesis that tokenized funds will eventually sit beside ETFs as a core product line. In the span of a few months, tokenized treasuries have become an $8.3 billion asset class. Broader real-world assets (RWAs) now range between $24 and $30 billion. Yet the real contest isn’t in the numbers; it’s in who will custody the next $100 billion of digital paper and how those assets connect to traditional balance sheets. The first wave of bank entries shows a clear pattern. Goldman and BNY chose the least volatile and most systemically relevant asset they could: money market funds. Money market funds are among the safest and most liquid investment vehicles in traditional finance. They hold short-term government and corporate debt, giving institutions a way to park cash while earning modest yields with minimal risk. Tokenizing them turns those holdings into digital units that can be transferred instantly and settled 24 hours a day. For large institutions, the benefit is not speculative but operational: corporate treasurers can move cash faster, pledge assets as collateral, and reduce the frictions that come with banking cut-off times. Citi’s strategy moves in parallel through private markets. By joining SDX, Citi now provides custody and tokenization services for regulated digital securities, acting as the back-end for issuers experimenting with tokenized bonds or shares. The structure resembles traditional custody, but settlement happens atomically, meaning payment and asset transfer occur simultaneously without intermediaries. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund demonstrates how this can scale. The fund holds tokenized Treasury bills and represents them as programmable tokens. Its assets have grown more than eightfold in 18 months. With total assets at $13.5 trillion and nearly $100 billion of crypto-linked funds, BlackRock has the reach to turn tokenized products into standard portfolio components for institutions. If the early 2020s were about crypto custodians learning compliance, the mid-2020s are about banks learning blockchain. The players are different, but the economics are familiar. Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY already charge custody fees of roughly 0.05% to 0.15% of the value they hold, depending on client size and risk profile. As tokenized cash and securities become mainstream, these percentages start to resemble the fees charged in fund administration and collateral management, creating an overlap that did not exist before. In this version of tokenization, the appeal is not headline innovation but efficiency. A tokenized Treasury or fund share can move instantly between accounts and settle in real time, cutting costs for both clients and custodians. The conservative outlook for this market sees tokenized Treasuries hovering between $6 billion and $8 billion if regulation slows and yields fall. A middle-ground projection expects around $10-15 billion by mid-2026 as more banks integrate money-market products. The optimistic scenario reaches $25-40 billion if tokenized cash accounts tied to ETFs take off and if banks start testing repo markets for tokenized collateral. Repos are the backbone of short-term lending in finance. Banks lend cash in exchange for safe collateral such as Treasuries, agreeing to reverse the trade later. Tokenized repos would allow these transactions to settle automatically on a blockchain, reducing the operational delays and counterparty risk that currently require expensive intermediaries. That collateral link is what turns tokenization from a bookkeeping experiment into real financial plumbing. Goldman and BNY’s tokenized money-market shares already move within closed, permissioned environments. The next question is whether those tokens can move across custodians safely. The joint Project Guardian initiative between the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and Singapore’s Monetary Authority is testing that exact idea: shared standards for verifying compliance across public and private blockchains. If the project succeeds, 2026 could bring the first bank-to-bank repo transactions executed entirely with tokenized assets. Today’s systems still operate inside walled gardens. Networks such as Goldman’s GS DAP, SDX, and JPMorgan’s Onyx offer efficiency at the cost of interoperability. Regulators prefer this model because every participant is known and verified, but financial institutions are beginning to explore how permissioned systems might connect to public networks through cryptographic proofs that preserve compliance. If that link is established, custody fees could expand toward $300–600 million in annual revenue, assuming tokenized cash and Treasury products reach $25–40 billion in assets and charge service fees near 0.1–0.15%. Regulation will decide how fast this happens. In Europe, MiCA has introduced uniform rules for custodians and crypto-asset service providers, known as CASPs. These rules define how digital assets must be segregated, safeguarded, and reported, allowing banks to passport tokenized funds across the European Economic Area without facing different national requirements. The UK and Singapore are building similar frameworks through Project Guardian to standardize tokenization in asset and wealth management. In the US, the obstacle is accounting treatment. Under the now-revised Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, or SAB 121, banks holding crypto for clients had to record those assets on their balance sheets as liabilities. That made large-scale custody uneconomical for systemically important banks, also known as G-SIBs. If future guidance removes that burden, these banks could hold tokenized assets without incurring punitive capital requirements, unlocking the full balance-sheet potential of tokenization. Until then, the firms already embedded in ETF custody, Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY, retain a practical advantage. Coinbase’s $246 billion in assets under custody shows how much flow still runs through crypto-native infrastructure. Yet the gravitational pull of regulated fund structures is increasing. As tokenized Treasuries and money-market products scale, the operational logic of banking begins to merge with blockchain’s settlement mechanics. Money-market tokens may sound like plumbing, but plumbing determines who controls the flow of funds. In this race, the flow is not just digital assets but the future structure of the balance sheet itself.

Pump it up, Until you can feel it When we think about ETFs, we tend to think about large, cheap passive indexes. After all, those are the biggest ETFs from places like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. But when we look at all the new ETF launches, they tend to not be passive indexes, not be cheap, and not come necessarily from those three big companies. They’re active and they are involved in all sorts of different areas, that are off the beaten path. To figure out what this means for you and your portfolio, let’s bring to figure out what this means for your portfolio. Let’s bring in Dave Nadig. He is the President and Director of Research at ETF.com and an ETF structural expert, really since the inception of the entire sector. Dave, we’ve seen an explosion in the growth of not just new ETFs, but primarily active ETFs in all sorts of niches. What are you seeing in this space? Dave Nadig: Well, you know, for a long time ETF meant cheap index, right? I mean you go back to SPY and then the first iShares products, and then even when we started getting into the big expansion of the two thousands, it was all just index, index, index. Then we got some smart beta where we tried to be a little bit more clever and it wasn’t really until the late 2010 cycle where Kathy Wood at Ark Invest, launched ARKK and really put herself out there as the portfolio manager in a way that I don’t really frankly remember seeing since the dot-com boom, right? It’s been a long time since we’d had superstar managers on CNBC talking about, you know, pounding the table for a single stock. And Kathy did that and obviously had enormous amounts of success, has had some performance hiccups along the way, but that sort of went a little bit dormant during some of the pandemic when people really discovered trading. What we’ve seen now is this resurgence – particularly to folks I’d mentioned Dan Ives Wedbush, people know him; and Tom Lee from Fundstrat with his Granny Shots ETF, both of which have pulled in huge money, Barry Ritholtz: Billions of dollars? Dave Nadig: Billions and billions of dollars. And for the reasons you would expect because you’ve got smart people talking on podcasts and TV and on their own air and their own newsletters telling you why they own what’s in the fund. I know that sounds so dumb, but that’s why people love superstar managers because they can look and they can see Tom Lee on screen and he can sit there and say, yeah, this is why we like Bitcoin here. Here are the three firms we have in our fund because of it. We might be wrong, we might be right. There’s a level of authenticity to that that I think is really appreciated. I also think the fact that they’ve doubled the S&P this year doesn’t hurt. Barry Ritholtz: So to put some flesh on the bones here, Kathy Woods during 2020 was a huge Tesla and Bitcoin bull. The fund arc put up giant numbers, triple digit gains. Dan Ives has been an apple and an Nvidia bull, pretty much for as long as I can remember. He’s been a whole lot more right than wrong, and Tom Lee has been very constructive exactly when it paid to be constructive and stay bullish. All three of those managers have really big followings. What does the resurgence of brand name active managers mean for the ETF space? Dave Nadig: Well, first of all, I think it’s great for the ETF space because I think the dichotomy that we’d had where people thought of active as being a thing that happens somewhere else and ETFs were only passive, wasn’t helpful. I think we are moving towards a world where all of your exposures, for the most part are gonna be in an ETF wrapper. So by all means we should get active managers as part of this mix. And now we’ve got lots of them. You know, we’ve got a bunch of active funds from PIMCO was early, we’ve got lots in the bond space. You know, everything from Cumberland advisors to State Street with the double line and, and Jeff Gundlach. Lots of active managers in lots of different areas. I think that’s very healthy for the industry. For the individual investor, it doesn’t necessarily make your life easier because as much as I happen to, like all the people we have talked about, Dan, Dom Lee and Kathy – personally as people I would have dinner with, the math is not on their side as an industry, right? Barry Ritholtz: Why is that? Dave Nadig: As an industry, we have to point out active managers categorically underperform over time. Doesn’t mean they all do, but it means that you’ve gotta be the special person who managed to pick the right active manager at the right time. That is a tough business and even the active managers running these funds will tell you trying to time when to get in and out of their own funds is gonna be tough. So that’s the problem is that active management is tough to evaluate. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, and to put some numbers there, half of all active managers underperform in any given year. You go out to 10, five years, it’s 80% underperform; at 10 years it’s 90%. So it’s a tough road to hoe But let’s talk about what makes active ETFs somewhat different than active mutual funds. And that data I referenced where all mutual fund data, mutual funds have to do a regular filing each quarter about their largest holdings, there has been a lot of back and forth about how transparent active ETFs have to be versus other active funds. What’s the state-of-the-art today? What is the regulatory environment? Dave Nadig: So there are solutions if you’re an active manager and you don’t want to tell everybody what you’re doing every day. There are solutions and there’s plenty of funds that have been launched on them. Fidelity has their versions. T Rowe Price has been one of the more successful funds out there. They have a pretty popular blue chip strategy called T Chip, which isn’t semi-transparent, meaning they’re not telling you the whole portfolio every day. They’re telling you once in a while and they’re giving the street just enough information to make a good market, not knowing all the information. So it’s sort of a, a clue, a bit of a hack to be semi-transparent. This solves a problem for some asset managers. It doesn’t solve a single problem for an individual investor, right? So like I’ve never heard an individual investor say, golly, I wish I knew less about what I owned. Right? Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about why it’s a problem for fund managers. Fund managers don’t buy a stock on a Monday and then they’re done. If they say, “Hey, we like XYZ, they’re buying that stock trying to take advantage of drawdowns buying it over days, weeks, even months. So there is a price advantage to the investor if the fund manager can be a little less transparent. Fair, fair description. Dave Nadig: That’s the, that’s certainly the argument that the active management industry who does not wanna disclose what they’re doing would give you. So you have articulated that side of the argument. Well, my counter to that would be if your strategy requires you buying securities where your action is going to move the market absent disclosure or absent, you know, obfuscation, then that strategy probably doesn’t belong in an ETF because you’ve got bigger problems, right? That means that you are in something small or a liquid or micro cap, at which point already, my question would be how do you plan on running a $10 billion ETF with that strategy? Because you can’t really close an ETF. So if you are a special situations manager, if you are a really sort of obscure nichey finding those stocks, nobody else knows about manager, you do not belong in the ETF industry. I’ll just flat out say it as simple as that. The mutual fund structure or even better, a liquidity cap structure like a CEF or an interval fund is actually a better structure for those kinds of investments. Everybody else, CEF, honestly there’s so much liquidity. I think it’s tough to argue that somebody like Tom Lee is being particularly hurt by being transparent. He’s double, he’s at 30% for the year. The S&P500 is up 15% Barry Ritholtz: CEF stands for closed end funds as opposed to ETFs. Dave Nadig: Yes. Barry Ritholtz: So, let’s talk about some other varieties of active funds that are a little bit out there. We see funds with options, futures, derivatives, inverse leveraged, and along with some wild income promises in an ETF wrapper. Tell us about some of those products. Dave Nadig: Yeah, the, the interesting thing about those is most of them are very mechanical, right? So if you’re running a leveraged strategy, you’re not making any decisions, right? I’ve got Apple, I need 2X Apple, I’m gonna go to my swap counterparty overnight and they’re just gonna settle up my two x swap. That’s the whole management process. But technically that’s gonna be an actively managed fund because you can’t just automate that whole process. Somebody still has to make a call about whether or not you’re teeing up the swap at this rate or that rate. Same thing with almost anything in the option space, because the options are constantly changing and constantly repricing and constantly rolling off. It’s very difficult to create solid index product around actively or high frequency moving positions in the options market. So for convenience as much as anything, almost all of those type products you mentioned are listed as active products. I refer to them as AiNOs — Active in Name Only, because they’re really, there’s no Tom Lee saying I really want Apple options today. There’s some guy generally Jay, pastor Elliot at title, sitting on a desk somewhere pushing a button to say yes, we want those options because the model says we need to roll. And that becomes active management. And consequently, I mean it is active management, it has higher costs associated with it for a reason. Some of that is the profit that the issuer wants, but some of it is legitimately you need a trading desk with a bunch of people doing work. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about another niche. Illiquid alts, things like private equity, private credit, private debt, real estate. Are we gonna see those asset classes that really don’t trade on their own — because they’re not public – are we gonna see those in an ETF wrapper? Dave Nadig: We’re starting to, we’re starting to the, the canary in the coal mine here was some products from State Street, the big ones, priv, PRIV for private, which has a bunch of Apollo private credit in it. Generally pretty short maturity stuff, two, three year kind of things and, and fairly straightforward, understandable private credit. Intel needs to bill a fab in Ireland. They go get a loan, Apollo gives ’em the loan, you get a slice of it. Nothing super complicated, nothing super interesting either. I mean, it’s not, you’re not getting 20% yields out of or anything like that. You’re getting some marginal increase in the yield you would get if you were simply investing in say, junk or short term co corporates. So those products are starting to come to market. The concerns I have about them is they’re just gonna be untested. We’re not gonna really know how they’re going to perform when the markets go hinky, right? And, and also what does that even mean? Like if we had a corporate bond blowout and we saw a bunch of triple C stuff start defaulting, I have no idea what the impact on Apollo private credit issued in Ireland to Intel is going to be when that happens. I also have no idea how they’re gonna respond if half the fund decides they want out on that Tuesday and now you’ve got a bunch of illiquid stuff, which can be up to 35% of the portfolio that literally the only buyer is Apollo. Technically they’ve got answers to all those questions. I’m, and I read all the answers to those questions and I’m sort of not convinced, but it’s one of those things that if you wanna be, if you wanna be out there on the edge, by all means go ahead. But I think the private securities in the daily liquid vehicle has not really been through the ringer yet, so I remain very skeptical. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk a little bit about crypto and, and how that’s going to impact in both investor behavior and portfolio construction. Last year, BlackRock, was it last year or this year, BlackRock introduced IBIT. 2024. So it’s a year ago coming up on a 100 billion dollars in assets, probably the fastest ETF ever to do that. What does this mean? And explain the concept of tokenization. Dave Nadig: Yeah, so what it means is all of these assets are going to be more and more available to the average Joe like us who’s just trading in their Schwab account or something like that. And because the SEC has said they’re gonna make it very easy very soon, we’re gonna have every major coin that people know about a Solana and Avay whatever. There’ll be a sleeve of that in an ETF that you’ll be able to trade. That’s all great. Then having those building blocks is awesome, also because it will now allow portfolio managers to create portfolios of those individual securities, which right now you can’t even do, you can’t even buy an index right, of the top 10 coins because there isn’t a target for the top 10 coins to invest in. So that will be fun when we get that, and I suspect you’ll see firms like Bitwise and BlackRock who’ve got some real bonafides in the crypto management space, start bringing pretty institutional active management products there. That’s probably a 2026 side. Long term though, if we wanna talk 10 years from now, that’s when crypto starts becoming an interesting competitor to the ETF space. I think we will eventually end up in a world where how you move your ownership of Apple around is going to happen. Not by going to the New York Stock Exchange and exchanging ledger entries to move around your Schwab account. Instead, you’re gonna have an actual token. You’ll be able to look at the serial number of it, you’ll be able to put it in a wallet and say, “Oh no, this is worth a hundred shares of Apple.” And that wallet will be able to directly move that security to your wallet without any exchange being part of the process. Most of it will happen, like crypto happens now on giant exchanges because price discovery. But just like with Bitcoin, I could walk up to you when we could engage in a direct transaction, you’re gonna start seeing that with other securities. It’s happening more in bonds and real estate now. To do it in equities is gonna require some actual legislation and we don’t make so many laws these days. So that may take some time. Instead, what we’ll do is we’ll wrap a lot of stuff. So you, you’ll probably hear about things like Wrapped Apple and wrapped Cisco and what that’s gonna be is a token that owns the security in some sort of trust pool. That’s a baby step, but that’s what we’ll start hearing first. So be skeptical when people say we’re tokenizing everything ’cause it’s gonna be a decade. Barry Ritholtz: I had a conversation with Jose Minyana who is the head of wealth strategies at investment Giant BNY (Bank in New York) and he was saying, Hey, we went from T+3 to T+1, meaning it used to take three days to settle a trade. Today it’s gonna take one day. If we wanna get to T+0, we have to really have confidence in both sides of the transaction. And theoretically, tokenization solves that problem. Dave Nadig: It does. Although think about how many big transactions in the world that we could be doing easier. We deliberately put breaks on, think about buying a house… Barry Ritholtz: Wiring money?! Dave Nadig: BarryRight? So it, there’s, you know, the, there’s escrow, there’s secondary inspection processes, there’s separate contracts around just the intention to buy and sell. So the bigger and more interesting a transaction gets, the less T zero is actually a good idea, right? I mean, I, the, the thing I always say about T zero is, did you really want T zero during the flash crash in 2010? Like, did you really want no recourse for that? That fat fingered billion dollar pennies on the dollar trade? No. You wanted this ecosystem that protects you from a bad actor spoofing something into the system. So we we’re gonna have a lot to evaluate as a market, what we actually want. The idea of slowing down markets has actually gotten a lot of traction, like speed bump markets, things like that, that, that are actually pushing against this idea of instantaneous settlement for anything. I don’t even want instantaneous settlement for my bank account. I like knowing that I’ve got somebody I can call when something goes wrong. Barry Ritholtz: So, so you’ve written about volatility and liquidity laundering. Explain what this is and are these really gonna be ETFs? Dave Nadig: They already are, man. So volatility laundering is simply moving volatility from one bucket to another and charging something for the privilege of doing that. Right Now you can buy something like MSTY, which will give you a hundred percent income return on a MicroStrategy position through the magic of options, right? And it creates a synthetic long position. Then it does a synthetic covered call against the synthetic long position, and then it does a whole lot of return of capital to give you your money back and promises you this endless stream of high distributions, a high percentage distributions that is volatility laundering. Because what you are actually doing is you are trying to sell other people the volatility of MicroStrategy, which is probably not a fantastic idea because it, the vol of all is high in those cases. So you are being the person picking up the, in this case, quarters in front of the steamroll, not the pennies, but you’re still exposed to MicroStrategy collapsing and going to nothing. That volatility laundering is what all of these options strategies are really doing. Barry Ritholtz: So really to wrap this up, the bottom line is bring the same level of common sense and scrutiny to new ETFs that you would to any financial product. Make sure you understand what the product is, how it generates gains, the sort of risks you’re incurring, especially with these exotic products — And the costs. Are these products worth spending 75, 100, 125 basis points more than what you would get for a plain vanilla passive index that seems to be dominating the asset allocation space and the space for ETFs? Be smart, be thoughtful, do your homework. I’m Barry Ritholtz. You’ve been listening to Bloomberg’s at the Money. ~~~ Find our entire music playlist for At the Money on Spotify.

Title: U.K.’s FCA sues Justin Sun-linked exchange for unlawful promotions

The FCA has taken legal action against HTX, formerly Huobi Global, alleging it unlawfully promoted crypto services to UK consumers. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority is accusing Justin Sun-linked exchange HTX of promoting crypto services without proper authorization. The lawsuit demonstrates a welcome of regulated products, while cracking down on offshore exchanges that violate promotion laws. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority [FCA] has filed a civil lawsuit against crypto exchange HTX, formerly Huobi Global. It accused it of unlawfully marketing digital-asset services to U.K. consumers without authorization. The case, lodged in London’s High Court, targets HTX. Also, it targets its predecessor entity Huobi Global, and four unnamed individuals connected to the exchange’s promotional operations. The FCA stated that the exchange breached the country’s financial promotions regime by offering crypto services without meeting requirements. The FCA stated, according to a Financial Times report, that firms operating outside the U.K. but promoting crypto services to British consumers are still subject to the U.K.’s financial promotion rules. “We will not hesitate to act where firms flout the law or put UK investors at risk,” an FCA spokesperson told reporters. HTX already appears on the FCA’s warning list, which alerts the public to firms “not authorized and likely to be operating illegally.” Market observers are describing the new case as a test of jurisdiction for U.K. authorities seeking to rein in global exchanges marketing to domestic users. The lawsuit adds to a growing list of legal challenges linked to Justin Sun, HTX’s de facto owner and founder of the Tron Network. In March 2023, the U.S. SEC charged Sun and the Tron Foundation for allegedly selling unregistered securities and orchestrating wash trades in TRX and BTT. That case remains open, although court filings indicate that both parties are exploring a potential settlement. Sun has also faced scrutiny over governance concerns, with reports alleging he controls the majority of TRX’s circulating supply. The U.K. action could widen regulatory pressure on Sun-associated firms. HTX’s integration with Tron-based assets and Sun’s recent efforts to expand HTX’s global footprint have kept his empire in regulators’ crosshairs. The lawsuit comes amid sweeping regulatory changes in the U.K. Earlier this month, the U.K. lifted its ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded products [ETPs]. This allows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs from firms such as BlackRock and WisdomTree to list on the London Stock Exchange.

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Hollywood has hit a breaking point. Audiences are fatigued by franchise sequels and reboots. YouTube has overtaken Disney as the world’s largest distributor. And Gen AI tools like Sora 2 can soon turn anyone into a filmmaker. Yet one thing hasn’t changed: how films get financed. And that’s why we keep getting fewer original films. Decline of original screenplays at the US box office (1984-2023) Source: The Numbers and Box Office Mojo For decades, filmmakers have had only two ways to raise capital: courting wealthy “patrons of the arts” or signing away IP in restrictive studio deals. These small circles still control who the next David Lynch will be, or which film becomes the next Napoleon Dynamite, while everyday fans — the people who live and breathe these films — have never had a seat at the table. (Fewer than 1% of Americans meet SEC “accreditation” standards to invest in most private ventures, including film.) That’s finally changing, thanks to tokenization. The promise of "decentralization in film” has arrived, quietly and legally this time. A few years ago, “Web3 Film” had the right dream but the wrong tools: people were slicing films into NFT frames, touting complex tokenomics and skirting securities laws. None of it worked. Projects like Stoner Cats, Ashton Kutcher’s NFT cartoon, became cautionary tales after the SEC cracked down for selling unregistered securities to unaccredited investors. Today, the difference is compliance. Through licensed platforms operating under SEC exemptions such as Reg CF, production companies can take on thousands of unaccredited investors (even in the U.S.) to back real film projects and share in the upside. Security tokens issued on blockchain rails make it possible to distribute dividends transparently and cost-effectively — and, eventually, trade investors’ stakes on secondary markets. And it’s already working. Tens of thousands of investors have contributed more than $30 million to premium productions from some of Hollywood’s most respected names. This year, Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Spy Kids) raised $2 million from 2,000 fans to invest in new action films — and every investor got to pitch him a film as part of the slate. Pressman Film — the company behind American Psycho, Wall Street and The Crow — raised $2 million for a slate of bold, original films, and is already starting to return capital within six months. And Eli Roth (Hostel, Inglorious Basterds) launched a fan-owned horror studio that maxed out its $5 million Reg CF campaign in July. He was tired of studios deeming his ideas too gory, even though the most profitable film of 2024 was the unrated slasher, Terrifier 3. Tokenized fan investing is opening up new paths for capital and creativity. Filmmakers can now tap their audiences for capital instead of taking the studio deal, allowing them to retain more ownership of their IP and take creative risks without interference from the suits or the algorithm. For fans, tokenization opens up access to a previously inaccessible opportunity: investing in film as an alternative asset class. Ultimately, these projects tend to perform better — not just creatively but financially — as audiences with skin in the game drive buzz and box-office returns. The timing couldn’t be better. With IPOs slowing and private markets swelling, tokenization is unlocking billions in household capital and opening doors to previously gatekept opportunities across private credit, venture capital and now, film. The GENIUS Act has brought long-awaited regulatory clarity to digital assets, while institutions from BlackRock to Visa are embedding blockchain infrastructure into the mainstream economy. Tokenization has quietly graduated from crypto casino to financial plumbing, and entertainment is proving to be one of its most relatable (and needed) use cases. There may be no better Trojan horse for mainstream adoption of tokenization than culture real-world assets (RWAs). Few industries are as ripe for disruption as film, and none as universally relatable, considering nearly all of us end our day watching Netflix (and then complain about the content). But when the audience can invest in the projects they want to see, whether from established filmmakers or up-and-coming creators, we won’t just get new financing models. We’ll get better movies.

Title: Amazon Is Automating 600,000 Jobs. Here Are The 5 Jobs At Risk In 2026

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. When Amazon’s internal strategy documents suggest that robots, AI, and overall automation will replace an estimated 600,000 jobs that would otherwise hire humans (more than half a million) by 2033, take note. The second largest employer in the U.S. has spoken, and it’s a strong indication of where we’re heading in the future of work. That scale of disruption will leave few job categories at the big tech giant untouched, and many workers will need a plan B. This, if anything, is a stark reminder of how AI is disrupting the workforce at scale, and the need for upskilling and reskilling in other areas. For context, this is happening even as the tech giant plans to double its output through the next few years. Karen Weise, writing for The New York Times (who first reported this story), notes that “Amazon’s plans could have profound impact on blue-collar jobs throughout the country and serve as a model for other companies like Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, and UPS. The company transformed the U.S. work force as it created a booming demand for warehousing and delivery jobs. But now, as it leads the way for automation, those roles could become more technical, higher paid and more scarce.” Whenever there is a wave of layoffs or the threat of roles being cut out from an organizational structure, the usual likely culprits tend to be roles that are repetitive or routine in nature. These roles also do not typically require strategy and strong decision-making and creative skills, which makes it easier for them to be at risk and liable to automation. Here are some examples of roles that would likely be targeted by Amazon as they ramp up AI implementation across their global operations: Throughout the supply chain, there are plenty of opportunities for automation because much of it consists of predictable workflows. As a result, Amazon will naturally anticipate high cost-savings from robots. And even though the entire Amazon workforce won’t disappear, the existing responsibilities of remaining jobs can be expected to change significantly. If you work in a blue-collar role liable to automation, or you’re concerned that your knowledge-based job is at risk of AI, here are some things you can do to future-proof your career and finances: Today is day one of your transition. Start now to upskill and prove your value in ways that robots and AI can never replicate.

Title: Andreessen Horowitz Says Crypto Has Entered a ‘New Era’ of Real Utility

Time Published: 2025-10-22T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto’s future is starting to look more like a global financial system and less like a speculative playground, according to Andreessen Horowitz. In its State of Crypto 2025 report, a16z analysts argue that the industry has entered a new era shaped by infrastructure upgrades, regulatory clarity and deeper ties with traditional finance. Among the most important trends for the coming year: stablecoin growth, real-world assets moving onchain, and new intersections with artificial intelligence (AI). Stablecoins, which enable fast and cheap dollar transfers, are seeing wide adoption from institutions like Visa, Citi and PayPal. Visa said it sees strong demand in volatile emerging markets and cross-border payments. According to a16z, stablecoins handled $46 trillion in transactions over the past year — more than double PayPal — and now rival major networks like ACH and Visa. They’re also becoming major U.S. Treasury holders, surpassing countries like South Korea and Germany. As regulatory efforts in the U.S. gain traction, stablecoins could strengthen the dollar’s global position. Legislation around market structure is expected to be a top priority in 2025, giving companies a clearer framework to launch products and onboard users. Institutional momentum is picking up too. BlackRock and JPMorgan are building crypto partnerships, while Morgan Stanley plans to offer crypto trading on E*TRADE starting at the beginning of 2025. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bitcoin BTC$110,627.52 and ethereum ETH$3,872.78 now hold over $175 billion combined, signaling a shift from fringe asset to portfolio staple. Meanwhile, a quiet infrastructure revolution is underway. Ethereum upgrades and the rise of Solana have pushed blockchain transaction speeds to over 3,400 per second — closing in on the scale of credit card networks. These technical improvements, along with new privacy tools like zero-knowledge proofs and preparations for quantum-resistant encryption, are making blockchains more usable and secure. Real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries, commodities and equity instruments are beginning to move onchain, with $30 billion already tokenized. This shift could rewire how capital markets operate by creating more efficient settlement layers and round-the-clock liquidity. AI is also becoming part of the equation. Developers are exploring how crypto tools like decentralized infrastructure and smart contracts can check the growing concentration of power in big tech's hands. Though crypto has lost some engineering talent to AI startups, it's also pulling new entrants from adjacent industries. Finally, developers are starting to focus more on revenue-generating products. Projects brought in $18 billion last year, and about $4 billion of that flowed directly to tokenholders — hinting at a maturing business model that rewards users and investors alike. As user numbers reach up to 70 million, a16z expects consumer apps to drive the next wave of growth. The report paints a picture of crypto not as a trend but as a long-term platform — one that’s finally finding its footing in the mainstream economy.

Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was first reported missing, has retired to consider its verdicts. Luke Taylor, aged 28, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork, have both pleaded not guilty to the murder of Kieran Quilligan. The murder count which each man denies states that on a date unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the District Court area of Cork City he did murder 47-year-old Kieran Quilligan contrary to Common Law. Before the jury began their deliberations this afternoon, Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford told the two women and 10 men that they are dealing with two seperate trials and the verdict in respect of one of the defendants could be different to the verdict on the other, if the jury so decided. Ms Justice Lankford said their verdicts had to be unaminous. She said there are three verdicts open to the jury in respect of each defendant. They can find him guilty of murder, not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His skeletal remains were found on scrub land near Midleton on 29 January 2024, almost five months later. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: APT price soars as BlackRock’s BUIDL fund expands to Aptos

Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:46:05Z

The APT price is showing renewed strength as Aptos gains major institutional backing from global giants like BlackRock and Jump Crypto. After dipping to a yearly low earlier this month, Aptos has staged an impressive comeback, fueled by real-world asset tokenisation and enterprise-grade innovation across its ecosystem. Aptos has outperformed a sluggish crypto market, gaining around 5% in the past 24 hours to trade near $3.32. This sharp rebound follows BlackRock’s expansion of its Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Aptos blockchain, a move that has injected $500 million worth of tokenised Treasuries into the network. 🚨 $500M more of @BlackRock's BUIDL just landed on Aptos. This pushes Aptos back into the Top 3 in RWAs, with $1.2B+ tokenized assets on-chain. And now, we're #2 in BUIDL adoption. Institutions are choosing Aptos, the chain to move what matters. pic.twitter.com/vT3jfZYmPb — Aptos (@Aptos) October 21, 2025 The deployment of BUIDL has pushed Aptos into the top tier of real-world asset (RWA) blockchains, sitting just behind Ethereum and zkSync Era. Data shows that more than $1.2 billion in RWAs are now tokenised on Aptos, a milestone that marks growing trust from traditional finance. Notably, BlackRock’s involvement brings not only prestige but also liquidity and credibility to the network. In parallel, Jump Crypto has launched Shelby, a decentralised, high-performance storage layer developed in collaboration with Aptos Labs. Storage is the missing layer. Blockchains run fast. Oracles work. Messages move across chains. But without high performance storage, real execution stays centralized. We're building Shelby with @AptosLabs to fix that.https://t.co/VFtuFRQp4P — Jump Crypto 🔥💃🏻 (@jump_) October 21, 2025 Designed to rival traditional cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud, Shelby enables sub-second latency, low-cost reads and writes, and improved scalability. Its architecture reduces redundancy while maintaining high data durability through erasure coding. The new system could become a backbone for decentralised applications that require real-time data access and high-speed processing. By combining Aptos’s parallel execution engine and Move programming language with Shelby’s efficient data design, the two firms aim to create infrastructure suited for enterprise and AI-driven decentralised finance (DeFi). This blend of performance and programmability is helping Aptos carve a niche in a crowded Layer-1 field. As institutional adoption accelerates and on-chain liquidity grows, the Aptos price could continue to benefit from renewed investor confidence. While short-term volatility remains, the network’s long-term fundamentals appear stronger than ever — anchored by innovation, partnerships, and a clear path toward real-world integration. The Aptos price is currently testing resistance near $3.50 after rebounding from a recent low of $2.22. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with moving averages flashing multiple sell alerts, although oscillators remain neutral. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 34, suggesting mild accumulation. If APT breaks above $3.50, it could extend gains toward $3.85. However, failure to maintain current momentum could see the token slip toward $3.00 or even retest its earlier lows. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have noted that APT remains at one of its lowest valuations in years, hinting at potential upside if broader market sentiment improves.

Title: Blockbuster $40b AI Investment Is Only 10% of What’s Coming (NVDA, MSFT, META, BLK)

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 AI giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle recently announced a $40 billion deal that will help them secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence. The blockbuster data center deal is a big reason why Morgan Stanley estimates that Global AI infrastructure spending is projected to hit $400 billion this year. Some speculate that all of this AI dependency can be risky, however, because if AI stumbles, all major tech stocks could fall simultaneously. Previously, individual companies were affected by performance in their specific sectors, but now many will rise and fall together based on AI sentiment. It’s why so many have compared this moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where enthusiasm for a single technological trend drove valuations beyond reason. Douglas McIntyre: Lee, one of the things we’re seeing in the world of AI is these massive alliances, you know, where different companies form partnerships and everybody brings piece of their expertise to the thing and work together. It’s not always clear who gets what from whom and who put what in, but you’ve got one, you just, you got one that just came out. Lee Jackson: Boy, do I ever, I mean, when you get, okay, and I’m gonna have to, I’m gonna read these off to you, Doug. When you get BlackRock, who’s clearly has more dough than anybody in the world, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to all chip in $40 billion to buy aligned data centers. That shows you that the demand for cloud computing and data center storage, and, and retrieval and all of that has got to be, they see it to be exponentially much, much bigger than we can see it right now. Or why would they go in and spend $40 billion to buy this? And I think it’s, I think it’s pretty provocative because it’s, it’s like all four major partners in the industry who have been very happy to just do circular financing is now, we have now deemed it to be that they’re gonna combine to have this capacity for, for cloud computing and, and all the above. But $40 billion is a big chunk of dough even for those kind of major players. And it’s interesting. Will we see more of this? Will we see other data center providers? And there’s big ones, you know, there’s super big ones and, you know, Digital Realty people like that. Will somebody go in and make a big play for them? Or somebody you know of that size and scope. I think it’ll be interesting to see if this expands and there’s more data center purchases, you know, as we head down the road. McIntyre: If you called me up tomorrow and said to me that Microsoft bought Duke Energy there’s, or Constellation, it’s, this is crazy enough now, so that you could actually see a consolidation based on an based on ownership. If I’ve got, if I’ve got the technology and you’ve got the infrastructure, maybe I should just buy you. Jackson: Absolutely. And I don’t think, you know, and as we’ve discussed, you know, you’re not gonna build any small scale nuclear reactors anytime soon. And the approval process, you know, could take forever. Although I’m sure they could help speed it up ’cause we’re gonna need it for the national power grid ’cause we’re gonna need it. But yeah, I think, I think that’s true. And you know, there’s big players like Digital and Equinix and people like that, you know, that have been in the business forever, you know, from, you know, startup, you know. In that industry. And it’s interesting to focus on, well, will they continue to build more or will people continue to consolidate that industry? Because again, the question is, is it getting away from itself as well? Are we building too many data centers? I don’t think so because the demand is just never ending. But boy, it, there’s gonna be a point, I think when, and, and we’ve had this discussion where data center usage and power usage is gonna, there, there’s gonna be an issue here at some point, and that’s why most of these people are trying to desperately to find a way. That’s why they’re building data centers in North Dakota and South Dakota because of the, the big, you know, oil fields up there, and that’s why they’re building them in Texas. That’s why they’re building them out in the Permian and out there. And so it’s like, okay, if we can’t bring the electricity to us, we’ll go to where the gas, the natural gas is, and we’ll build our own. McIntyre: It’s funny, CNBC did a, an article today and it’s, it’s, it’s based on a, a see your own shadow premise. Apparently, the people looking for data centers are shopping around the utilities. So if I’m gonna build a data center, I may call 10 utilities try to. What’s happening is the utilities are now getting confused about how many data centers there might be. Because if, if you call me and it’s just, I’m the one utility and you’re the one person who wants a data center, that’s easy to count, right? One guy called me about one data center, but if I’m the utility and ten data centers around and you say to me, “Do a forecast. I want you to forecast for me how many data centers we’re gonna have to support. It’s like, well, ten guys called me, but if I don’t get any of them? Or what if I get all 10? So there’s a capacity calculation problem that has the chance of me being that you’ll have overbuilding it. It could be that people have phone calls that they think, well, I’ll, I’ll build because I’m gonna get five of the ten. The town over does the same thing. There is a situation, scenario, as they say, where you could have overbuilding based on shadow demand, is they asked me, so it must be that they’ve picked me. Jackson: And the thing that will be interesting to see, if we do overbuild, which typically you know, has happened in the United States for, you name it, what do you do with empty data centers, with racks and racks and racks of servers> McIntyre: When that happens, we’ll just pull out the racks and turn ’em into huge barnyards. Listen, at least we know they have to be close to water for cooling. We know that they’ll get some electricity, so we need to keep the lights on for the cattle. So there’ll be water for the cattle ’cause they’ll be located, they’ll have water and we’ll have some electricity and we can use it. We can use them basically as a huge farm. Jackson: Well, I think this deal is either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You know, I don’t know what it is for the data center wave and, and, and data center building and data center construction, but we’ll find that out soon enough.

Title: Apple Stockholders Hit $850 Billion Jackpot

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past ten years, Apple (AAPL) stock has delivered a massive $847 billion back to its investors in tangible cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. In fact, AAPL stock has provided the highest returns to shareholders of any company in history. Continuing this trend in 2025, Apple raised its quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share, reflecting a 4% raise. Apple’s board has also authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of common stock. Let's examine some statistics and see how this payout ability compares to the market's largest return-of-capital entities. Why should you be concerned? Because dividends and share buybacks represent direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also reflect management's confidence in the company’s financial stability and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Moreover, there are other stocks exhibiting similar traits. Here is a list of the top 10 firms ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there’s significant value in the broader diversified approach we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend beyond just equities. What about a portfolio comprising 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities and bonds - is it likely to yield greater returns in the next 1-3 years and offer better protection if the markets fall by 20%? We have analyzed the figures. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What catches your attention here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely correlated to growth potential for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a much quicker rate, in a more predictable manner, compared to the others, yet they have returned a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That represents the downside to high capital returns. Yes, they are appealing, but you must ponder: Am I compromising growth and robust fundamentals? With that consideration, let's review some data for AAPL. (refer to Buy or Sell Apple Stock for more information) Apple Basics That provides a good summary, but assessing a stock from an investment standpoint requires much more. This is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio accomplishes. It aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside. AAPL Historical Risk Nevertheless, Apple is not insulated from significant declines. It fell roughly 81% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered a 61% drop in the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 correction and the Covid sell-off also experienced reductions of around 31-39%. Even the recent inflation shock caused it to decline by approximately 31%. Strong firms can endure storms more effectively, yet sharp market downturns can still be severe. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decrease even in favorable market conditions - consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Check AAPL Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Counter-Drone Technology Strategic Intelligence Report 2025: Key Market Opportunities in Defense Due to the Growing UAV Threats

October 22, 2025 09:46 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence - Counter-Drone Technologies" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.Counter-Drone Technologies essential in the defense industry, as a successful drone attack can have severe strategic and financial consequences. To overcome drone attacks, companies, nations, and militaries are increasingly adopting a collaborative approach. This approach involves acquisitions, sharing information on threats with their allies, and reporting attempted breaches to improve counter-drone postures.This report explores emergent trends within the C-UAS market, examining use cases and the implementation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and directed energy weapons, and what challenges must be considered in pursuing effective strategies for brand building in this market.C-UAS are essential defense assets The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has gathered pace in recent years, with most states having access to some form of UAV platform. As new technologies such as AI and drone swarms mature, UAVs have become increasingly important in the fields of defense and security. To counter this emerging threat, investment in cutting-edge Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) capabilities is essential. The commercialization of drones is a key driver in the C-UAS market, with technological advances lowering the costs of acquiring drones, thereby increasing access. This has led to wider commercial and governmental proliferation, which itself necessitates the development and procurement of C-UAS in a variety of defense, commercial, and law enforcement roles. In an increasingly multi-polar world, investment in defensive C-UAS capabilities will only accelerate. Throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both sides have deployed UAVs extensively, with amateur footage of drone deployment becoming a major symbol of the conflict in international media. The Ukrainian military's meticulously planned Operation Spiderweb assault in June 2025 was a series of successful covert drone attacks deep inside Russian territory, which, according to Ukrainian sources, damaged or destroyed at least 41 Russian military jets, including several Tupolev-95 strategic bombers. The raids served not only as a major propaganda victory but as an acute reminder that, given the focus on the development and advancement of drone technology, it is likely that the cultivation and procurement of robust C-UAS systems capable of countering a range of UAV threats (Groups 1-5) will be essential. Furthermore, the potential for the weaponization of commercially available small UAS (sUAS), such as the installation of grenades and mortars on recreational quadcopters as seen in Ukraine, will continue to drive capable C-UAS systems on all scales.Key Highlights Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: List of Tables List of Figures Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/qw5d8f About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) possesses a strong historical precedent for delivering rapid, significant share price appreciation, including rallies of over 30% in under two months (as seen in 2010 and 2024), and an even rarer surge of more than 50% in 2025. This established momentum highlights the stock's potential for high-velocity gains, which investors can capitalize on when specific business catalysts align. The current market strength is anchored by recent performance across three core business segments, all detailed in the company's Q2 2025 results. The primary drivers for continued growth are: These quantifiable operational successes provide a strong fundamental basis for another powerful upswing in Alphabet's share price. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GOOGL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It certainly helps if the fundamentals check out. For details on GOOGL, read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock. Below are a few numbers that matter. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When thinking about risk for GOOGL, it helps to look at how much it fell during major market crises. The biggest hit was the Global Financial Crisis, with a drop of about 65%. The Inflation Shock in 2022 also pushed shares down by around 44%. The Covid pandemic brought a dip near 31%, and even the 2018 correction wasn’t mild, with a 23% decline. Look at – How Low Can GOOGL Stock Really Go – for more details. These numbers show that while GOOGL is strong on fundamentals, it’s not immune when markets turn sour. Drawdowns of this size are something to keep in mind, even for big names. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Samsung’s new XR headset is secretly a Pixel

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 22, 2025 Last week, I got to spend some time with Samsung’s newest device, a mixed reality headset called the Galaxy XR. This is the “Project Moohan” product Samsung has been working on for ages to take on the Apple Vision Pro. It’s an important launch for the company, and it’s even priced to compete — well, sort of. At $1,799, it’s about half the price of Apple’s headset, which is certainly good news, but still a massive amount of money. I’ve already talked extensively about what the Galaxy XR is and what it’s like to use it. In this article, though, I want to talk about something I realized almost immediately after my demo with the headset: this isn’t really a Samsung device. I know, that sounds weird. It has the word “Galaxy” in its name, and the hardware is clearly the result of Samsung’s incredible manufacturing and engineering. But the soul of the machine, the actual experience of using it? That’s all Google. When I hear “Samsung Galaxy,” I have a very clear set of expectations. I expect to see things like One UI, Samsung’s heavy-handed-but-feature-packed Android skin. I expect to find Samsung-made apps, Galaxy AI features, and maybe even a stray Bixby command. Hell, I at least expect to see the words “Samsung” or “Galaxy” somewhere on the device itself. That is not what this is. What I used felt less like a Samsung product and more like the first-ever Google Pixel XR headset, one that Samsung just happened to build. During my demo session with the Galaxy XR, I was looking for traces of One UI. I was waiting for the familiar app icons, the Samsung settings menu, and yeah, even the bloatware. They never came. This got me thinking about the Galaxy XR keynote launch, and I realized there were no Samsung apps or features mentioned there, either. Instead, everything I saw was Google. It seemed as pure and untouched as the software on a Google Pixel phone. Honestly, this was bizarre. Using a $1,799 Samsung device without any real Samsung presence in the software felt almost wrong. To be clear, everything was perfectly functional, but just not what I expected. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? In fact, the Google experiences are what literally define this product. If you compare the Galaxy XR ($1799.99 at Samsung) to the Meta Quest 3 ($499.99 at Best Buy) or the Apple Vision Pro ($3499 at Apple), you’ll see a lot of crossover, such as with the core design, hand-tracking controls, etc. What the Galaxy XR offers that the other two don’t come directly from Google: Gemini and Google Play. Let me start with the Play Store. Since Android lives at the core of Android XR (obviously — it’s in the name), pretty much every app and game available on the Play Store right now will work straight out of the box. There will be exceptions, of course, such as with anything that requires a phone-shaped device or a physical display. But 99% of the Play Store is already working on the Galaxy XR, giving it a huge leg up over something like the Meta Quest 3. And then there’s Gemini. When Google announced Android XR late last year, it said this was the first OS designed from the ground up for the “Gemini era.” It wasn’t kidding. Gemini isn’t just an app you launch when you want it; it’s woven into the OS. This makes the Galaxy XR the first (and, as far as I can tell, only) XR headset on the market that is built for AI. During my demo, I could access Gemini anytime by holding down the multi-function button on the top right of the headset. The familiar Gemini interface popped right up. I could talk directly with it about whatever, as usual, but the real trick is that Gemini could see everything that I saw. This was helpful during the software demos, such as when I was in Google Photos. I could ask about what was in the photo, when it was taken, or to identify anyone in it. Samsung also showed off a demo of Gemini helping a gamer by checking out what they were playing and giving them tips on how to succeed. And remember that the headset can also “see” the real world through a low-latency, full-color video stream. This enables you to not only ask Gemini about what it sees in VR but also what it sees around you in reality. You can even use Circle to Search in this mode. The rest of my demo was basically a greatest-hits tour of Google’s apps, remixed for mixed reality. All this was incredible, but at the end of the demo, I asked the Samsung rep helping me out, “So, where are all the Samsung apps? Where’s One UI?” I got a very polite, very corporate non-answer: “For today, we’re just focusing on these incredible Google-powered experiences.” So yeah, they’re not there. Maybe they’ll be added later, or maybe they’ll even be there when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box, but I doubt it. If that were true, why weren’t they shown to me? In the end, this device feels like it’s 80% Google, 15% Samsung, and 5% Qualcomm. That isn’t a criticism — I’m not saying the headset is bad. It’s just that my limited experience with it left me feeling like Samsung is just acting as the manufacturer for Google’s own flagship XR ambitions. And this all gives me a serious case of déjà vu. It reminds me of 2011. For those of you who weren’t obsessing over Android back then, Samsung and Google partnered on a legendary phone: the Galaxy Nexus. The Nexus branding was Google’s “stock” Android label that predated Pixel, which eventually replaced it. The phone had Samsung’s absolutely incredible hardware — it was one of the first phones with a big, beautiful HD AMOLED screen — but it ran pure, stock Android. There was no clunky TouchWiz skin, which was what Samsung’s software was called back in those days. It was the “Google Experience Phone,” but it was built by Samsung. That is exactly what the Galaxy XR is. In that sense, one could look at this as the spiritual successor to the Galaxy Nexus, like the Nexus of mixed reality. However, Google hasn’t used the Nexus branding in years, so all that’s left is to call this what I think it actually is: the Pixel XR. The only question left is whether anyone will buy it. The Apple Vision Pro has been a well-known bomb (by Apple standards, anyway). Apple couldn’t convince the world to buy a $3,500 face computer. Samsung and Google are betting that “half the price” is the magic number. But $1,799 is still an enormous amount of money for a device that, for now, seems like a very cool, very expensive toy for gaming and looking at 3D maps. I remain cautiously optimistic. I want this to succeed. But as it stands right now, the most interesting thing about Samsung’s new headset is how little Samsung is in it. Thank you for being part of our community.

Title: The M&A Curse of Warner Bros. Discovery | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members WBD is officially in play. Can CEO David Zaslav do right by his shareholders after three-plus years of holding a declining stock? Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was undergoing a “strategic review” on Tuesday after the company said it is fielding “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. Its stock popped 11% on the news. But mergers have generally not been kind to the company that started out as Warner Brothers in 1923, including what history will record as one of the worst mergers ever with AOL Time Warner, whose shareholders lost $2oo billion in the aftermath of that dot-com bubble marriage in the early aughts. That didn’t stop the Ellisons’ billions, which have actually made what would have otherwise been a ho-hum year for M&A in media and entertainment pretty interesting. Through their own new acquisition, Paramount, they set off a steeplechase for Warner Bros. Discovery — either as a whole entertainment conglomerate, or as two separated units in Warner Bros. and Discovery Global. That now begs the question of whether the Ellisons would take yet another crack at buying WBD, or maybe just the Warner Bros. studio and HBO, on a hot streak right now. Or do we see some new deep-pocketed buyers emerge? Paramount reportedly made a $20 a share bid for WBD that was spurned, and then two additional bids under $30 a share according to CNBC, leading to CEO David Zaslav‘s announcement: “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.” But the constituency we aren’t reading too much about here is the WBD shareholders who are sitting on a stock at Tuesday’s close that is still 17% lower than when WBD first started trading on April 11, 2022, after Zaslav engineered his Discovery’s takeover of Warner. That is 17% lower, notably, even with the takeover talk bump to WBD stock from when Paramount’s interest first broke and then the 11% rise on Tuesday. For shareholders, that’s three-plus years of watching your stock go in the opposite direction of where it’s supposed to go. Big shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock on the institutional side, and Condé Nast owners the Newhouse family and cable mogul John Malone on the individual side. (Malone inherited the Warner stock, a big bonus over the downward course where Discovery was headed.) The Ellisons seem suited to shake things up. It feels like their parachuting into Hollywood was all about that, with the bags of cash to make it happen. But now that the “For Sale” sign is officially up at WBD, you’d have to consider Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Comcast or maybe even a consortium of private equity or Saudi backers as potentially interested suitors. On Tuesday, Ted Sarandos left the door open to considering Warner, saying on the earnings call: “We focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A,” Sarandos said, with an emphasis on selective M&A for effect. Zaslav brought in the big-gun investment bankers to assist with his review, Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan and Evercore. Let’s pause for a minute to consider the math: $12.54 — This was WBD’s closing price on Sept. 10, the day before Bloomberg broke the news that Paramount was preparing a bid. $16.17 — This was WBD’s closing price the next day, showing a 29% bump on a so-called takeover premium. Takeover offers in the media space have been attracting a 20% to 25% premium. If Paramount did indeed offer $20 per share offer, that represents a 59% premium from the $12.54 where WBD was languishing before the takeover news broke. But clearly Zaslav and team are thinking that WBD could see more upside from bringing in other potential buyers to boost a premium for the company. Circling back to those downtrodden WBD shareholders. Bank of America Securities on Tuesday placed a value of $30 per share on WBD ($26 for the Warner Bros. studio, which includes HBO, and $4 for the cable networks side, which includes CNN). So what if a buyer would come in with a $30 a share offer for the whole company? That would be a 48% premium to the current price, and 140% premium to the Sept. 10 closing price. Pretty enticing for a shareholder who’s held on for three years in a downward slide. Zaslav was schooled under the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch when he was starting out at NBC, so don’t underestimate his deal savvy, even though WBD shareholders are feeling like they got stuck with a dud.

Tech Companies Pushing Off Those Exits: Research firm CB Insights reported some interesting data last week as part of its State of Venture Q3’25 Report that shows that tech companies are in less of a rush to strike an exit. “The ability to raise at decacorn ($10 billion and above) valuations while staying private removes the pressure to go public for capital. Companies can now scale to a massive size, hire top talent through liquid secondary markets, and maintain founder control — all without the quarterly earnings pressure or regulatory burdens associated with going public,” CB Insights explains. Average time for tech startups to stay private rose from 12.2 years in 2015 to 15.9 years in 2025. See below. 2. AI Killing Jobs? Not if You Look at This Data: It seems like companies are increasingly bringing people on board who help embed AI into daily operations, but new data dispells the widespread notion that the technology is a job killer. The Economist cites work by Seyed Hosseini and Guy Lichtinger, both doctoral students at Harvard University who have been tracking companies that hired “generative-AI integrators.” The students used AI itself to go through 200 million job postings and found 130,000 such vacancies at 10,600 firms that they called “AI adopters.” See below for the upward trend. When you hear Libby Bush talk about her motivating drive over the years, one that has been rewarded with a senior executive role for partnerships at CAA, it’s hard not to think it came from her days on the soccer pitches and lacrosse fields of her youth outside Philadelphia. She ended up playing Division I lacrosse for the University of Richmond Spiders, a sport she’s still involved with near her home in Pacific Palisades. “I certainly didn’t get promoted because I waited for somebody to recognize my worth. It takes fighting for yourself, asking for things even though you might not feel qualified or you might not feel like you’ve hit the mark completely to deserve it. The worst people can say is no. “It’s a little bit of the fake it til you make it. I never worked for an agency. How did I have the right to start one? But I believed enough in myself, I was willing to take the risk and I was willing to hear the word no as many times as I needed to until I heard the word yes. Holding myself back and not doing it because I didn’t have the qualifications was just never a part of the trajectory for me.” Sure feels like the spark of a competitive athlete is still in there somewhere. Bush, 43, spoke to our TV business reporter Lucas Manfredi for last week’s installment of our Office With a View executive Q&A series about the importance of brands becoming an essential tool for creators to both finance and market their projects across platforms. Bush has been responsible for leading the CAA team behind collaborations between hit series like Netflix’s “Bridgerton” and Flonase and Apple TV+’s “Severance” and State Farm. She’s also worked closely on connecting brands directly with CAA clients through projects like Ariana Grande’s Swarovski ad campaign, the NBC competition series “On Brand With Jimmy Fallon” and Kerry Washington’s YouTube series “Street You Grew Up On.” Bush, whose career has taken her to the NBA, WNBA, Disney and to her own startup agency Tandem Entertainment that CAA later purchased, is aware how important it was to hone her own story if she was going to help creators and brands do the same. “One size does not fit all in this business. There’s a lot of options on how to financially get deals done and creatively tell great stories in entertainment and culture.” Ad Age this year put her on its list of Leading Women, an honor for which some commenters on LinkedIn called her a “badass.” Our favorite part of her interview with Lucas was this career advice: “I would also say I learned a lot about mentorship and mentoring. When you work in really big corporations and you start out young in your career in these big organizations, you realize really quickly that people will continue to grow in their careers and they may end up anywhere. “So to me, it was always about treating everybody — whether they were next to you, below you or above you — the same, and how important it is to collect relationships and nurture them. Your network becomes everything to you in your career. Understanding how to use it and protect it and nurture it is a really big lesson for me throughout those companies.” The PR Guy Who Says The AI Boom Is a Bust, Channels with Peter Kafka podcast What’s Your AI-dentity?

Today’s top news: DraftKings just made its most aggressive move yet outside of sports betting. And it wasn’t into casino, poker, or fantasy. It was into prediction markets. 📌 What Happened DraftKings announced it is acquiring Railbird Technologies, a CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange, and will use it to launch a standalone events trading app called DraftKings Predictions. Railbird comes with what Kalshi and others fought hard for - federal approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to let people trade real-money contracts on real-world outcomes. Now DraftKing’s 6M monthly users will get access to prediction markets (and its $15B company has a shiny new expansion path). DraftKings says the new app will launch “in the coming months” and initially cover non-sports markets - things like finance, pop culture, elections, entertainment, and news. Though sports are very likely to come later (especially in states where DraftKings is currently banned). 🗣️ What Are They Saying “We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business. We believe that Railbird’s team and platform—combined with DraftKings’ scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.” - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC “DraftKings acquires prediction market firm Railbird As I shared last week prediction markets are the future for sports wagering Less than a week later you see $DKNG getting involved.” - Rippe, on X “$DKNG is acquiring CFTC-licensed predictions platform Railbird to launch “DraftKings Predictions” a marketplace for trading outcomes in finance, culture & entertainment. It’s a move to tap non-sports states like California & Texas in the coming months.” - Shay Boloor on X 🧠 Why It Matters If prediction markets needed any more validation, they got it here from DraftKings. They have simply become too big to ignore and are now fully crossing over into mainstream betting. There’s also a new battle brewing between two worlds: DraftKings brings three big advantages: They will be a force to be reckoned with in this space. A lot depends on timing here. Someone who is used to betting elections on Polymarket probably won’t switch to DraftKings. But - if DraftKings beats Polymarket to the US market with its new DraftKings Predictions app, it could absolutely steal that average user who knows what prediction markets are / Polymarket is, but doesn’t want to hassle with VPNs. And if DK sports prediction markets have the same liquidity that Kalshi has shown over the past few months, then they could steal significant market share in sports. The bull case is, the entrance of DraftKings into the prediction market sector grows the overall pie and drives weekly volumes even further up and to the right. The bear case - the sector is zero-sum for the near future and any DK share is taken from an existing leader. My gut is, the bull case will prevail for the near future.

Title: Watch These Key Netflix Price Levels as Stock Drops After Disappointing Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-key-netflix-price-levels-as-stock-drops-after-disappointing-earnings-11834484
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:46:39Z
Full Content:
Netflix (NFLX) shares tumbled in premarket trading Wednesday after the streaming giant 's third-quarter earnings came in short of Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings per share of $5.87, compared with the $6.92 EPS that analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had anticipated. Executives said an unplanned charge tied to an "ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities" weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue rose 17% from the year-earlier period to $11.51 billion, in line with analysts' estimates, and Netflix projected another 17% increase in the fourth quarter, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. Netflix shares were down more than 7% at around $1,150 in recent premarket trading. Through yesterday's close, the stock had risen 40% since the start of the year, far outpacing the 15% gain of the benchmark S&P 500 index over the period. Below, we take a closer look at the Netflix chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After hitting their record high in late June, Netflix shares have consolidated within a descending triangle, a bearish chart pattern that signals a potential move lower. Indeed, the stock looks set to tumble toward the pattern’s lower trendline following the streamer’s weaker-than-expected earnings report, reinforcing a downward bias. Let’s point out two key support levels to watch on the Netflix chart amid the possibility for further weakness and also identify overhead areas worth monitoring during future recovery efforts. A decisive volume-backed breakdown below the descending triangle could see the shares initially test a key support level around $1,065. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near the stock’s prominent February swing high. Further downside could see a more-significant drop to the $942 level. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near last December’s peak, which also closely aligns with a series of corresponding price action on the chart between January and April. It’s worth noting this area also sits in the same neighborhood as a bearish measured move target that calculates the width of the descending triangle near its widest section in points and deducts that amount from the pattern’s lower trendline. Recovery efforts in the stock back toward the descending triangle’s upper trendline could see the shares test the $1,265 area. The price may run into overhead resistance at this level near a trendline that connects peaks on the chart in June and September. Finally, buying above this area could propel a bullish move to around $1,341. Investors who have bought Netflix shares during its consolidation period in recent months may decide to lock in profits around the stock’s all-time high.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 If any investor has stood the test of time, it’s Warren Buffett, and with good reason. For years, the Oracle of Omaha has had a rock-star-like presence in the investing world, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting draws thousands of loyal investor fans. Buffett remains one of the world’s most prominent investors, known for his long buy-and-hold strategies and massive portfolio of public and private holdings. Long-time investors and Buffett mavens are familiar with this quote, “His favorite holding for an S&P 500 stock is forever.” So it is not surprising to report that for all of the success and stature Berkshire Hathaway has in the investment world, three top companies make up over 50% of the fund’s total holdings. While much more concentrated than most portfolio managers would ever consider, the strategy has worked for Berkshire Hathaway investors for years and likely will in the future. Here are the three companies that are over 50% of Berkshire Hathaway. Paul Morigi / Getty Images There are few investors with the results and reputation Buffett has garnered over the past 50 years. While investing has changed over the past half-century, buying good companies with products and services known worldwide while paying dividends will always stay in style.

Revenue grew 11% to $18.43 billion, surpassing forecasts of $18.05 billion as net income of $2.9 billion was up 16% compared to last year. The company offers products and services to customers worldwide, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies, and large corporations.

Title: Dublin to host Michelin star ceremony – could Ireland be about to get a three-star restaurant?

The Michelin Guide annual ceremony for Britain and Ireland will land in Dublin for the first time in February next year. The selection of an Irish city for the ceremony on February 9th, following Glasgow in 2025, is not just about geography – it’s about signalling that Ireland’s culinary moment is now. At the event in Dublin’s Convention Centre, the Guide will unveil stars, Bibs Gourmands, Green Stars and special awards for “the most talented restaurant teams and chefs from Great Britain and Ireland”. The ceremony will also be livestreamed globally. La Rousse Foods, Musgrave’s premium food service brand, will be official partner. If past years are anything to go by, the Bibs and Green Stars will be teased or quietly announced before the main stars are revealed. In Ireland the speculation about awards is electric. Chapter One in Dublin under Mickael Viljanen and Ross Lewis is viewed as possibly being in line for a third Michelin star. It currently holds two. Liath in Blackrock, Co Dublin, with chef Damien Grey is widely tipped as one to watch – again, rumours suggest a push toward three stars. Dede in Baltimore, Co Cork, helmed by Ahmet Dede and managed by Maria Archer, is also in the conversation for top-tier elevation. For two-star upgrades, names to watch include Lady Anne at Mount Juliet Estate (chef John Kelly) and Adare Manor (chef Mike Tweedie), which is also gearing up to host the Ryder Cup in 2027. Dublin’s incomprehensibly overlooked spots are Library Street Café and Una Mas, both long considered deserving of a first star. The newer challengers – Lena and Comet – may well be poised to make their first splash. Outside Dublin, the Park Hotel Kenmare in Co Kerry under Bryan and Tara Meehan already holds two Michelin Keys for its hotel offering and is undergoing a significant expansion. The owners may well be holding off on chasing a Michelin star for their Landline restaurant, adorned with Seán Scully paintings, until after this upgrade is complete. In a more general sense, hosting the Michelin ceremony in Ireland is symbolic, speaking of recognition and rising ambitions. But hosting isn’t the same as winning. The kitchens still need to deliver. Between now and next February, a few questions are sure to keep buzzing around the Irish restaurant scene. Will Chapter One finally get its third star?

Title: Investors Pause To Wait For Magnificent 7 Earnings

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors await earnings results from the Magnificent Seven stocks, starting with Tesla (TSLA) after the market closes on Wednesday. The large-cap S&P 500 index and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite were nearly flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%. Tesla is expected to report EPS of $0.56 per share after missing the consensus estimate for three consecutive quarters. The EV maker reported $0.72 per share earnings in last year’s third quarter. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock declined in pre-market trading after the streaming company fell short of expectations on revenue and profit. Netflix’s miss may be a less-common outcome in this earnings season, however. Bloomberg reports that among S&P 500 firms that have already reported earnings, 85% have beat profit expectations. If the trend continues, the third quarter of 2025 may end up being the best earnings quarter since 2021. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are mixed ahead of the market open on Wednesday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 rose almost 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%. Dow Jones futures declined 0.1%. What is a bubble in investing? In investing, a bubble is a period of rapidly increasing asset prices, usually driven by investor enthusiasm more so than underlying value. Bubbles end when prices reset or “burst.” The run-up in prices and the correction that follows tend to be overreactions to market conditions. To oversimplify, an optimistic trading environment can fuel aggressive buying and a general increase in risk appetite. Investors may stretch outside their normal parameters in terms of valuations and business fundamentals. The immediate outcome is positive—stock prices keep rising, which encourages more buying. At some point, investors begin to take profits from the run-up. This can be prompted by a change in economic conditions, disappointing earnings, or something else. The profit-taking can be as contagious as the aggressive buying. It can quickly shift into loss-aversion and panic if the selloff continues. Long-term investors can protect themselves from bubble-related volatility by sticking to their investment plan. Resisting the urge to follow the masses during the rally is key. A diversified portfolio of quality assets should be resilient enough to withstand the correction or crash that can follow a bubble. Also, the price reset that follows a bubble can be a good time to snap up under-priced shares.

Title: The 3 Bitcoin Treasury Company Models According to Michael Saylor
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-3-bitcoin-treasury-company-models-according-to-michael-saylor/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
A deep dive into the three strategic models emerging in corporate Bitcoin treasury companies, from pure-play credit issuers to hybrid operators, based on Michael Saylor’s latest thinking. But not all Bitcoin treasury companies are the same. In fact, Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently outlined a clear taxonomy for understanding the landscape: a three-tiered hierarchy that separates dabblers from dominators. Each tier comes with distinct incentives, risks, and expected outcomes. For investors, analysts, and executives, understanding this framework is essential for evaluating capital strategy in the age of Bitcoin. This is the highest-conviction model—a company that is entirely focused on accumulating and optimizing Bitcoin as its core strategic asset. Bitcoin is not just a reserve asset; it is the business. Pure plays are engineered for one thing: capital transformation through Bitcoin. They raise equity and issue Bitcoin-backed credit, using the proceeds to accumulate even more Bitcoin. Their growth isn’t tethered to traditional business models or fiat performance metrics. It flows directly from superior monetary architecture. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Advantage: Examples: Saylor’s View: “These are the next Mag-7 stocks. They can go from a billion to a hundred billion, even a trillion.” Pure plays are the apex predators of Bitcoin capital markets. They can achieve 100x or 1,000x returns because they own their category and multiply Bitcoin-denominated value through disciplined issuance and strategic clarity. This tier reflects a hybrid approach—companies with real Bitcoin exposure and strategic intent, but not full alignment. Strong Bitcoin operators maintain an existing business model while also accumulating BTC and potentially issuing Bitcoin-backed instruments. Their conviction is meaningful, but their operational complexity or regulatory constraints prevent full conversion. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Advantage: Expected Outcome: These companies are capable of winning in the Bitcoin era, but their upside is constrained by competing priorities. They are often stuck between traditional shareholder expectations and Bitcoin-native capital innovation. At the base of the hierarchy are companies that hold Bitcoin on the balance sheet as a passive hedge. They aren’t actively building around it, issuing Bitcoin-backed debt, or educating the market. They simply hold it. This model is increasingly common among firms that want long-term exposure without significant operational changes. Over time, as Bitcoin appreciates, it becomes a ballast for market cap—supporting equity value even when the core business underperforms. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Role: Expected Outcome: This model doesn’t transform capital markets. But it does offer a superior hedge versus holding fiat or underperforming fixed income. This hierarchy isn’t just semantic. It determines who thrives in the Bitcoin era. The delta between tiers is massive. A hedger might preserve value. A strong operator might outperform. But only a pure play rewrites the game. Saylor doesn’t see this as a corporate trend. He sees it as a full-spectrum transformation of credit, equity, and capital markets. “Bitcoin treasury companies are the engines, the drivers, the dynamos powering up that network.” In his view, a new financial system is emerging where: The companies that embrace the pure play model today will anchor this future. They will become the new financial institutions—issuing digital credit, shaping capital flows, and compounding Bitcoin-denominated value faster than traditional models allow. George Mekhail, Managing Director of Bitcoin For Corporations sits down with Michael Saylor to discuss Bitcoin disrupting capital, redefining balance sheets, and shaping 21st-century economics.

Title: How Beyond Meat became the market's latest meme-stock darling

Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now. Market musings It's 2019. You get out of an "Avengers: Endgame" screening and pop your earbuds in. You like this up-and-coming artist, Billie Eilish, who seems pretty promising. You fire up a new app called TikTok. You can't figure out how it's different from Vine, but everyone seems to be into it. You pop into a local eatery and order one of those new plant-based Beyond Meat burgers that everyone's talking about. The company is valued at $14 billion. It doesn't taste great, but you're told it's the future of food. Fast-forward to the present day. Beyond Meat is worth less than $1 billion, and was a penny stock until very recently. Sales are a fraction of what they were. No, this is not some dystopian reality. The fact is, the competition stacked up against Beyond, and demand for meat alternatives waned. But something has shifted in the stock this week. Shares surged 128% (to $1.47) on Monday, on trading that was roughly 70 times the average. It followed that up on Tuesday with a 146% increase (to $3.62) on even more volume. Then it soared another 65% on Wednesday, bringing the three-day move to more than 800%. What gives? Well, it turns out that a retail investor named Dimitri Semenikhin (screen name: Capybara Stocks) has been buying up all the Beyond shares he can find. He says he now owns about 4% of the company's outstanding stock, and he posted about it on Reddit. Given the fact that Beyond already carried the natural characteristics of a meme stock — a nostalgic brand heavily shorted by institutions — the post was like catnip to Semenikhin's fellow retail traders. Business Insider's Sam O'Brient tracked down Semenikhin — who is based in Dubai — on Monday, while Beyond stock was ripping. He wanted to find out what was motivating him. Why take such a big position in a downtrodden penny stock down more than 80% year to date? Semenikhin provided some fundamental reasons. Key among them was the completion of a convertible note exchange, which he says lessens its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthens its balance sheet. He said this was incorrectly viewed by some as a negative. "At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening," he told BI. In a separate interview on Tuesday, he said that he sees the stock soaring another 66% from current levels, to around $6 per share. Semenikhin's undervaluation thesis may very well be true. After all, Beyond on Tuesday announced a collaboration with Walmart that — when combined with the lingering retail rocket fuel, and the stock's addition to a meme-stock ETF — sent shares surging more than 100% for a second straight day. But there's also no denying that Semenikhin is trying to emulate the playbook of Roaring Kitty, the GameStop-obsessed retail investor who was eventually immortalized in his very own movie. It's also clear he's having a similar effect, with Monday's price surge in Beyond defying fundamental logic. There's the regular YouTube posting. There's the Reddit activity (although his original post is now deleted). And there's the unrepentant desire to drive a short squeeze. Will Semenikhin go full Roaring Kitty and start wearing a signature headband? That remains to be seen. But the similarities run deep, and BI will continue to check in with him for updates. Look at that V-shaped bounce! Thanks a lot, Dimitri Semenikhin (and Walmart). Beyond Meat stock is now down just 4% in 2025, compared to the 86% loss through last Thursday's close. The rally has coincided with unprecedented options-trading volume for the stock, and as daily shares traded broke the 1 billion threshold for two straight sessions. The title of this chart from BlackRock Investment Institute says it all: earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 are reaccelerating. This is reflected by the upward slope of the orange line, which shows the 12-month change in profit forecasts. This aligns with the guidance we've gotten so far from industry bellwethers during the third-quarter reporting season. On Tuesday alone, General Motors, GE, Lockheed Martin, and RTX raised future earnings forecasts. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. They make you feel like you're walking on a cloud. You can wear them with a suit or with jeans. They'll earn you street cred with finance bros. The catch? They're $1,100. Zegna's Triple Stitch shoes have unofficially become Wall Street's hottest footwear, exploding in popularity in recent years amid the quiet luxury movement. Apple CEO Tim Cook sports them. CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin told BI he wears them too, and that he sees them everywhere. The Wall Street Journal proclaimed a few years back that they're the most-worn shoes on private jets. But they're not only popular with the uber-rich. Sales associates at multiple Zegna locations in Manhattan said that they have a wide age range of financial industry clients. Are they really worth the hype? Eager to see for myself, I went to the brand's global store on 57th Street in NYC to try on a pair. My review, in short? They're absolutely worth the money. If you're the type of person who is OK with dropping a rent payment on some sneakers, at least. I didn't love their plain look initially, but how they feel on your feet completely changes your perception of them. I'm usually a size 11.5, but the folks at the store said they recommend going a half-size up. They come in 30 different color options — I went with a black and white scheme. They were easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I'd ever worn. After being made a convert, I decided to head out and try to spot a pair of them in the wild.

A visitor from Charleston, South Carolina, said he had his custom-made last year and picked up three pairs. "I love them," he said, before asking: "Are you gonna buy a pair?"

Title: Why Some Bitcoin Whales Are Converting Their BTC Into Spot ETF Shares: Bloomberg

Some large bitcoin holders are moving coins into spot exchange-traded funds through in-kind creations, converting off-platform BTC into brokerage-account assets they can borrow against or include in estate plans, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The mechanics rest on a summer policy shift. On July 29, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the decision to approve orders allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto-asset exchange-traded product (ETP) shares, a policy which covers spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). The agency called the change a break from earlier cash-only approvals for spot bitcoin and ether and an alignment with long-standing practice for commodity ETPs. In practice, the SEC said authorized participants can deliver or receive the underlying asset, rather than cash, when creating or redeeming ETP shares. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the shift would make products “less costly and more efficient,” while Trading and Markets Director Jamie Selway called it an “important development” that adds flexibility for issuers and investors. Against that backdrop, Bloomberg reported that some whales are handing BTC to ETFs and receiving fund shares without selling, a structure the outlet noted is generally tax-neutral because no sale is recorded. The exposure stays the same, but it appears in a brokerage account where it can be pledged as collateral or folded into estate planning, Bloomberg said. Activity is already visible, Bloomberg reported. BlackRock has facilitated more than $3 billion of such conversions, its head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick said. Bitwise told Bloomberg it is getting daily inquiries from clients who want holdings reflected on wealth platforms. Galaxy has processed a handful of transactions, Bloomberg added, citing Michael Harvey. Some clients shift only a slice of holdings; a “subset” consolidates entirely because “it’s the easiest way” to hold going forward, Mitchnick told Bloomberg. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro said there are “benefits of having things in the traditional financial system,” including how clients are serviced by private banks. Banks already play a limited role in facilitating these trades — particularly on creations — even as only non-bank broker-dealers can currently complete the full process, Bloomberg added. Neither BlackRock, Bitwise nor Galaxy immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Title: Inside Superstar Investor Cathie Wood's AI Stock-Fueled Comeback
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/10/22/inside-superstar-investor-cathie-woods-ai-stock-fueled-comeback/

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Among all the growth-minded investors who have seen their portfolios soar through this year’s AI craze, one familiar name has outperformed the rest. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 87.1% in the last year, outperforming every other ETF and mutual fund tracked by the American Association of Individual Investors as of the end of September aside from single-stock funds. Its gains have been largely fueled by AI-related stocks like Palantir Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Tempus AI, and its longtime largest holding, Tesla, which Wood tells Forbes is the “largest AI project on earth,” marveling at its work developing robotaxis. The last time Wood was riding this high following her flagship fund’s 157% return in 2020, her idealism and stubborn conviction soon backfired, leading to a 14% loss in 2021 and a dreadful 67% crash in 2022. Even after it has tripled since then, it remains 42% below its February 2021 peak. The flagship fund has $8.3 billion in assets under management, down from $17 billion at the end of 2020, signaling that most investors abandoned her fund during its slide. Wood dismisses any notion that she is being swept up in another bubble like the Covid-19 stock surge. “The companies investing in AI are some of the most profitable companies in the world,” says Wood. “The reasoning models are astounding people in terms of how much more they can do if you give these models time. I think there were a lot of people expecting at some point the performance would level out. It's not leveling out at all.” Almost every AI stock has performed well this year, but Wood, Ark’s 69-year-old founder, CEO and chief investment officer, has had a nose for the biggest winners even relative to their peers. Ark owns more AMD than larger competitor Nvidia, two semiconductor stocks that make up 4.0% and 1.1% of ARKK’s portfolio, respectively, a prescient choice with AMD doubling in value this year compared to Nvidia’s more modest 36% gain. Wood says AMD’s lower valuation at less than $400 billion, while Nvidia’s market cap is $4.4 trillion, makes its growth prospects more appealing, and its superiority in chips with more expansive memory is becoming more of a differentiator. Palantir has done far better, gaining 337% since last November. Its data analytics technology helps government agencies and commercial customers blend and find patterns in massive datasets, and its 12-month sales have grown 39% year over year to $3.4 billion, with $763 in net profit. But Palantir is the poster child for the AI stock bubble, according to most value oriented investors. Its $430 billion market cap is a jaw-dropping 126 times its sales. Though Wood has taken profits in Palantir, selling 70% of Ark’s stake since August 2024, it still makes up 4.2% of its flagship fund as its ninth-largest holding. “If Palantir were not at its current valuation, given its position in the platform-as-a-service space, and we think they effectively own that space, it would be right up there with Tesla [in our portfolio],” says Wood, referencing her firm’s 11.9% holding in the electric vehicle giant. “There’s nothing like it out there.” That’s high praise from Wood, who has loved and owned Tesla for almost a decade. It was a key contributor to her 2020 performance with its 731% gain that year, then it mirrored her fund’s crash in 2022, losing 68%. Last year, Ark raised its price target for the stock to $2,600 per share by 2029, implying a market value of around $9 trillion. Tesla shares currently trade for $443 and has a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. Ark estimates that by 2029 86% of Tesla’s earnings will be attributable to its robotaxi business, which it just launched in Austin, Texas this June. “EVs are one and done—you sell a car and hope the customer comes back in five years, and they're very low margin,” says Wood. “When analysts look at what robotaxis are, they have to use a different model. It's more of a subscription or recurring revenue model, and it's very high margin.” With $1 billion in ARKK invested in Tesla, the holding is twice the weight of its second largest position, Coinbase, but aside from that investment, Wood generally doesn’t invest very much in $1 trillion market-cap tech giants. Amazon, Meta and Nvidia are all in her portfolio, but not in the top 15. Avoiding mega tech stocks but doubling down on the smaller-cap stocks turned out to be a grave mistake for Wood in 2022. Virtual health business Teladoc Health lost 88% in 2021 and 2022. Game development firm Unity Software fell 80% in 2022. Bets on biotech and life sciences firms like Ginkgo Bioworks, Exact Sciences, Beam Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics all floundered. “We had no idea that we were going to run into a buzzsaw. Many people think it was interest rates, and sure, all long duration assets got killed,” Wood reflects. “But our bigger problem was the supply chain shocks that lingered for so long. Because what drives our models is unit growth. The more unit growth, the faster costs can decline with new technologies.” In hindsight, Wood concedes the “correct thing to do” would have been to find shelter in larger-cap innovators that were more resilient to supply chain issues and rising interest rates, but she thinks today’s policy environment is far more favorable to her strategy. A longtime Donald Trump supporter, she applauds his move in January to rescind parts of a Joe Biden executive order that aimed to set some standards for AI regulation. New depreciation schedules in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act have also eased corporate tax burdens. “The amount of deregulation that is taking place in this administration is astonishing,” she gushes. “I don't like tariffs, but I would take tariffs if you also gave me what this administration has given with deregulation and much lower tax rates.” What investors think of Wood depends largely on when they invested. ARKK’s 31.8% three-year annualized return as of September 30 is better than the S&P 500 Index’s 24.9% figure, but its -0.8% five-year number looks terrible compared to the market’s 16.5% annual gains. But rewinding further, a 15.3% annual return since inception in 2014 is back to outperforming the market by two percentage points. It trails the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 16.9% annualized returns in that span, but it’s narrowing that gap. It’s hard for any investor to come back from an 80% loss from peak to trough, but the Nasdaq similarly lost close to 80% during the dotcom bust, and has gained about 2,000% in the quarter century since. Wood is hopeful that decades from now, its 2022 collapse will similarly look like a blip on ARRK’s long-term stock chart.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record $477M in inflows after four days of outflows

Time Published: 2025-10-22T08:16:05Z

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered strong inflows on Tuesday, reversing the previous week’s outflow trend. According to data from Farside Investors, total daily net inflows reached $477.2 million, signalling renewed investor confidence following a period of volatility in the crypto market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the inflows with $210.9 million, while the Ark & 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) followed with $162.8 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also recorded $34.15 million in new investments. The inflows come after several consecutive sessions of net withdrawals across spot crypto ETFs, which collectively lost over $1 billion in recent days as persistent trade tensions between the US and China weighed on investor sentiment. Despite the rebound in inflows, overall trading activity remained elevated. Bitcoin ETFs posted $7.41 billion in total trade volume on Tuesday. Throughout October, daily trading volumes have fluctuated between $5 billion and $9.78 billion — significantly higher than the $2 billion to $4 billion range seen in September. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw renewed investor participation. On Tuesday, the funds collectively attracted $141.6 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the largest portion at $59 million, while additional inflows came from funds operated by BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck. The combined rebound across Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that institutional appetite for crypto exposure remains strong despite recent price corrections. At the time of writing on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $108,500, stabilising after facing resistance the previous day. The cryptocurrency found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $106,453, drawn from its April low of $74,508 to its record high of $126,199. BTC rebounded nearly 4% by Monday but later slipped 2% on Tuesday after being rejected from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $113,606. If the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could revisit support near $106,453. A decisive close below this level may open the door for further declines toward the October 10 low of $102,000. Ethereum (ETH) has also shown signs of weakness, extending its recent correction. After retreating by more than 4% last week from resistance at $4,232, the cryptocurrency continued to slide by another 3% through Tuesday. ETH was trading around $3,847 on Wednesday. Should the downward trend persist, Ethereum may test the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,593, which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA — a key area that could determine whether the broader trend remains intact or shifts further bearish.

One of Dublin 4’s most sought after addresses, Pembroke Road, is a short stroll to cafes and restaurants on Baggot Street Upper and a short walk up the two bridges in either direction on the Grand Canal will take you to local Dart and Luas stops. A 15-minute stroll will have you in the centre of St Stephen’s Green, the Aviva Stadium for rugby internationals and the villages of Ranelagh, Donnybrook and Sandymount, all of which have a great selection of pubs and restaurants. Number 75 Pembroke Road is set well back from the road itself. It originally had an office block to one side, which was replaced in the 1970s with a set of apartments, though is accessed through the original period doorway. Located just off the junction triangle of Northumberland, Lansdowne and Pembroke Roads, it’s as smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge as you can get. Sharing its site with 30 other units, number 21 Pembroke Court is a second-floor dual aspect apartment that has just been released to the market through estate agent Owen Reilly. It has three bedrooms and a generous 97sq m (1,044sq ft) of floor space that has undergone a recent transformation since its owner purchased the unit in early 2021, for €525,000, according to the Property Price Register. It’s a smashing renovation of a 1970s unit that had little in the way of features until its owners gave it a stylish upgrade: “It was easy to see its potential, even though nothing had been done since the 1970s,” says its owner, adding “you don’t always get the luxury of all-square rooms, with proper windows that overlook a garden, but that, and the location made us buy”. With the help of Belgradian architectural duo Tihomir Dicic and Iva Njunic, the entire space has been reimagined to a superb, spacious three-bedroom contemporary apartment in the heart of one of the most desirable addresses in Dublin. By removing small hallways, the entire unit was opened up to give a lovely internal flow with the benefit of lots of light from large windows, all of which have been replaced with more energy-efficient aluclad units. When the walls were being insulated and upgraded, builders discovered the original brick walls of the period property next door. With advice from the architects that it could be exposed, and though it took “lots of cleaning and sealing” it is now a standout feature in the apartment, which owners have highlighted with the use of smart LED lights in an overhead shadow gap. In fact, thoughtful lighting – as 1970s ceilings are rarely high – was one of the many considerations when this unit was being refurbished. Central to the living space – off the dining and kitchen area – is a modular unit the family sourced from Nordic Elements in Blackrock, which sits so well around the television that you would think it was custom made for the room. Solid oak floors run through the C1-rated apartment, which has a streamlined kitchen with Bosch appliances and the focus on storage at design stage, allows the whole place to be streamlined and clutter free – despite this being home to a family with young children. Its three bedrooms comprise of two doubles and a single, and the family who live here say they were amazed at how the architects managed to rearrange the space to accommodate an en suite and so much storage in their home. Even the bathrooms are luxuriously subtle in a pared back kind of way, with focus on storage and illuminating soft tones from the wood. The owners, who are moving due to a growing family, have loved their time here – especially the garden out front where their children play – and say they live a mostly car-free life due to the location. This unit shows what a 1970s apartment can become with a bit of thought, and is now seeking €800,000 through Owen Reilly.

Share this article Bitcoin whales executed around $3 billion in ETF trades through BlackRock’s $IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, using portfolio trade mechanisms that offer significant portfolio benefits, Bloomberg reported today. The trades allow large Bitcoin holders to convert their holdings directly into ETF shares through custom creation processes. BlackRock has been facilitating these in-kind creations for $IBIT, enabling Bitcoin whales to seamlessly integrate their holdings into traditional finance portfolios. The structure mirrors portfolio trades commonly used in bond markets, where assets are exchanged directly rather than through cash transactions. The portfolio trade mechanism provides Bitcoin whales with benefits including enhanced liquidity and tax efficiencies. These custom ETF creation methods have gained traction in crypto markets as institutional investors seek regulated investment vehicles for their digital asset holdings. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen heightened institutional interest as traditional finance firms adapt to cryptocurrency integrations through ETF structures. The asset management giant has been expanding its crypto offerings in response to evolving investor demands for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Samsung Galaxy XR hands-on: Just the opening act

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 21, 2025 For nearly a year, Samsung has been hyping up a new XR headset, previously known as Project Moohan. Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way. So that leads us to the big question, which is whether or not you will actually buy this $1,799 headset. And let me tell you a secret: I think Samsung isn’t expecting you to. After my hands-on demo, it was clear that this headset is likely a foundational product designed to pave the way for the real revolution: future smart glasses powered by Android XR. Before I get into all that, though, let me tell you about the headset. If you’ve ever used a VR headset before, there are no real surprises here. The Galaxy XR hasn’t changed all that much from when it was first shown off as a prototype way back in December 2024. It has a glass front that protects multiple cameras and sensors. There are thick straps that connect the main headset to the back padding, which has a big dial on it for tightening or loosening the straps. There are three buttons on the headset: a multi-function button on the top right, and then a volume rocker on the top left. It was comfortable to wear, and it comes with removable light blockers that can help you be more immersed in your content by blocking off your peripheral vision. Conversely, you can remove them to keep yourself grounded in the real world (and hopefully offset any VR dizziness). Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Like Apple’s Vision Pro, the battery is not built into the headset. Instead, it’s a self-contained pack (see below) that connects to the device using a proprietary pin system. You can keep the battery in your pocket or rest it on the couch next to you while you are immersed in the VR world. The reason the Galaxy XR is designed this way is to keep that hefty battery weight off your head, which should make it more comfortable to use it for extended periods. According to Samsung, you should be able to get about two hours of use based on one battery pack charge. There’s been no word on whether or not you’ll be able to buy additional battery packs. Inside the headset are two displays (3,552 x 3,840 at 60Hz, 72Hz, or 90Hz) that automatically adjust themselves based on your face. This is made possible thanks to multiple sensors and cameras inside that perform eye-tracking functions. This means you don’t need to fiddle with knobs or move the lenses around to get the right focus — the headset does all the adjustments for you. For audio, there are small speakers above your ears that blast the sound out. This allows you to avoid wearing headphones and also lets you still hear the real world around you. Of course, if you’d prefer to use Bluetooth headphones, that’s totally fine, as the headset supports Bluetooth connections of all kinds, including earbuds, gaming controllers, mice and keyboards, and more. Unfortunately, the Galaxy XR doesn’t come with any of that stuff. When you buy it, you just get the headset and the battery pack. Samsung has made VR-style controllers specifically for the Galaxy XR, but they are an additional purchase. The fact that the headset doesn’t come with controllers is not such a big deal, though, as Google and Samsung want you to use your hands and your voice for controls all the time. So how do you use it without controllers? This is where the magic of the device really becomes apparent. Outside the headset, multiple cameras and sensors track everything your hands do in real-time. There are lots of downward-facing cameras on the front that capture your hand motions. Using these, you can control the operating system with hand gestures. A pinch acts as a left mouse click, and a pinch and hold acts as holding down the left mouse button, so you can drag windows around. You can use two hands to pinch to zoom in and out. Turning your hand around and pinching opens menus. Meanwhile, the eye-tracking cameras inside are monitoring your eyes at all times. This allows you to simply look at something and the headset understands what you’re looking at, which makes controlling things faster and easier. With this combination of hand- and eye-tracking, you can manipulate things in your VR environment without needing to hold a controller or have any sort of apparatus on your hands or wrists. The headset also offers opportunities for augmented reality experiences. The real world can be projected into the headset in full color with very low latency. Using Circle to Search, you could circle pretty much anything in the real world and do a search for it. Of course, you probably wouldn’t be caught dead wearing this around town, but it is fully wireless, so you could if you wanted to. The Galaxy XR hardware is all Samsung, but the software — known as Android XR — is all Google. As its name suggests, this is based on Android, so it works very similarly to what you’ve been using on your phones and tablets for nearly two decades. I expected it to come with something like One UI on board with a distinctly Samsung-ified look and feel, but instead, all I saw everywhere was Google apps in their usual stock style. There was nothing in the software that said Samsung at all, at least nothing that was shown in the keynote or demoed for me during my session. Every single thing was Google this and Google that. Where’s Galaxy AI? Where’s One UI? Where are the Samsung apps? Where’s Bixby? Regardless, because Android XR is based on Android, nearly every app and game on the Play Store will automatically work with the headset. It will present the app in its native format in a 2D window, and you can use it as normal. However, we do have a lot of unanswered questions about the OS. Will it be available to any company that wants to make a headset, just like Android is available to any company that wants to make a phone? How much will companies be able to customize it? How often will devices get updates? I asked a Google rep about all this, and they said that the company would announce all that in due time. So what is it actually like using this thing? At its core, the Galaxy XR is simply a VR headset with multiple opportunities for entertainment. The two most significant differentiators from the competition are its gaming prowess and the deep integration of Google’s Gemini. If you’re a gamer, you should know that this headset is going to be much better for gaming than the Apple Vision Pro and maybe even the Meta Quest 3. It will support Steam VR games when connected to a VR-ready PC and will also support 2D games through existing apps like Steam Link and Moonlight. It will also support pretty much every game on the Google Play Store. Connecting a standard controller to the headset via Bluetooth is dead simple. As mentioned earlier, you’ll be able to get VR-style controllers from Samsung as an additional purchase, opening the doors to all sorts of existing VR games. Apple made a big mistake by not working hard to support these kinds of experiences with the Vision Pro, so it’s great to see Google and Samsung aren’t making the same mistake. Even more significant than gaming, though, is Gemini. When Google announced Android XR at the end of 2024, it specifically called out that it was the first operating system designed from the ground up for what it calls the Gemini era. In other words, Android XR was built with Gemini already in mind. As such, it permeates everywhere throughout the operating system. You can activate Gemini at any time by holding down the multi-function button. This allows you to not only speak to Gemini but also easily show it your display, allowing you to ask questions about what you’re doing. For example, you could be playing a game and pull up Gemini to help you out with it. You wouldn’t need to explain anything to it, because it would be able to see the game, what level you’re on, your character’s health, and all that. If you have a bunch of windows open within your virtual environment, you can just ask Gemini to organize them for you. The really cool thing is that you can do this conversationally using Gemini Live; you don’t need to say “Hey Gemini” all the time. The demos I tried really hammered home how central Gemini is to the experience. The first thing I saw was Google Photos. The app looks and works just like it does on your phone, but the software can make any photo stereoscopic, which means it appears to have depth. You can easily turn this on or off with any photo in your library, and the depth effect is created on-device on the fly. Gemini works here for helping you find specific photos without needing to scroll through. Just say, “Show me my photos from our trip to France, Gemini.” After Google Photos, we jumped into Google Maps. You start out with an aerial view of the Earth, as if you were floating in space. You can then tell Gemini to take you anywhere you like, and you’ll zoom into that area, floating above it like a bird. You can then zoom in even further to explore places in street view, so it feels like you’re walking around the destination. Here, you can have a chat with Gemini as you’re exploring. Let’s say you spot a landmark; you can simply look at it and ask Gemini about it, and the AI will tell you whatever you want to know. The really cool thing, though, is you can actually walk inside select buildings. Google does this by using AI to stitch together existing photos and videos available on Google Maps, creating a realistic 3D environment. There are already over 1,000 locations in New York that work for this, such as the restaurant in the video below. Finally, we tried YouTube. I viewed an immersive 360-degree video shot specifically for headsets like the Galaxy XR, as well as an interactive 3D film where I could reach out and “touch” objects. I also watched one of my own videos that was automatically converted to be stereoscopic, which was pretty cool. However, that specific feature will not work when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box. Eventually, it will work on most YouTube videos, but it will be a while before it’s active. The Samsung Galaxy XR starts at $1,799, which is literally half the price of the Apple Vision Pro. While this definitely makes the device more affordable, $1,800 is still very, very expensive. This isn’t a tech product you just decide to buy one day. The Vision Pro has also been a well-established bomb for Apple, with sales figures estimated to be less than one million units. Samsung might be undercutting Apple on price by a wide margin, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s launching into a market that even Apple, the master of busting up existing markets, couldn’t crack. This is why I think the Galaxy XR is just an opening act. The real revolution will be smart glasses that do most of the things the Galaxy XR can do, but do it in the real world. We know this is coming, too, because Samsung and Google are already hyping them up with partnerships with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. If Samsung and its partners can make smart glasses that allow you to bring Android XR with you wherever you go and include an AI companion that can jump in and help you whenever needed, it could have a revolution on its hands. The Galaxy XR seems like a terrific product, but it’s still, at its core, just another VR headset. Most people who buy this will use it to play games and watch movies in their homes, by themselves. That doesn’t add up to a device that changes your life — that adds up to a TV screen you attach to your face. The idea that you can already do that with existing devices— and have been able to for a decade — makes this feel less like a revolutionary new product and more like a way-too-late entry into a plateaued market. So, will you buy the Galaxy XR? Or will you wait for the real revolution, which will be future smart glasses with Android XR on board? Based on what I saw, this is a very impressive tech demo that serves as a foundation for something much greater. It’s a device that feels designed to get developers and early adopters hooked on the Android XR ecosystem. But, in the end, all it’s doing is preparing them for the main event that’s still to come.

PHOTO: GIC Published Oct 22, 2025, 08:44 AM Updated Oct 22, 2025, 05:57 PM London – Deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds are helping drive a resurgence in dealmaking that has taken global merger and acquisition (M&A) volumes past US$3.5 trillion (S$4.5 trillion) in 2025. The M&A volume is now up 34 per cent this year, putting 2025 on track to be the best year since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than US$1.3 trillion in transactions were recorded in the third quarter, driven by a few mega deals. State-backed funds from the Middle East and Asia, including Singapore, provided firepower for some of 2025’s biggest transactions. Blackstone and TPG agreed on Oct 21 to acquire medical-device maker Hologic for as much as US$18.3 billion including debt, with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC taking minority stakes. Last week, BlackRock teamed up with Singapore’s investment company Temasek and MGX, an artificial intelligence investment firm set up by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment, on a US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres. US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres The week before, Carlyle Group partnered with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to buy control of BASF’s coatings business in a deal valuing the unit at €7.7 billion (S$11.6 billion). It was only in September that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund agreed to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private in a US$55 billion leveraged buyout – the biggest ever. Sovereign wealth funds have been building out their internal deal teams as they seek to do more direct investments, giving them a chance to profit without having to pay fees to Wall Street. They are among the biggest backers of private equity funds, and have squeezed out concessions that force the buyout firms to give them opportunities to invest alongside them in return for the cash they provide. The funds have been particularly active in tech. In August, private equity giant Thoma Bravo got backing from Adia for its roughly US$12 billion acquisition of human-resource software provider Dayforce. Abu Dhabi’s state-backed MGX has invested in OpenAI at a US$500 billion valuation. It has also backed Mr Elon Musk’s xAI and plans to contribute to US President Donald Trump’s Stargate venture. GIC and QIA have put money into rival AI start-up Anthropic. Rainmakers at the top investment banks said they expect the flurry of takeovers to continue. Goldman Sachs Group is predicting a major ramp-up in dealmaking towards the end of 2025, with a chance that 2026 will be a record year for M&A. Sovereign investors are on the hunt for more deals. Mubadala’s asset management arm is exploring an acquisition of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, the billboard operator with a market value of around US$930 million. And they are looking beyond takeovers, with the Qatari sovereign fund joining a more than US$2 billion fundraising for Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel’s new company, alongside other investors like Apollo Global Management and Ares Management Corporation.

Title: MindsEye employees renew allegations that GTA ex-producer Leslie Benzies’ Build a Rocket Boy was chaotic, mismanaged

The MindsEye fallout saga continues as new allegations have surfaced from former employees, detailing years of chaos behind the game's development, which was released in June to poor reviews and criticism that ranged from disappointed users to those that called it 'one of the worst games' they had ever played. Once eagerly watched in part due to Benzies’ role in elevating the Grand Theft Auto series into a cultural icon, Build A Rocket Boy secured over $300 million by 2024 and expanded to 448 employees across offices in Edinburgh, Budapest, and Montpellier. While it was initially focused on the ambitious multiplayer RPG Everywhere, which promised user-generated content in a futuristic open world, the studio shifted gears to MindsEye, which was originally perceived as a tie-in experience within Everywhere. Former employees have painted a grim picture of internal dysfunction, with one staff member, Jamie, who left BARB in 2022, telling the BBC that “Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make,” leading to “no coherent direction” that “plagued the project from the start.” Former lead data analyst, Ben Newbon, spoke about constant “knee-jerk” decisions from upper management, where critical feedback was consistently “ignored and never actioned.” At the same time, Benzies’ micromanagement manifested into what the team started to call “Leslie tickets” or “Leslie bugs.” All direct instructions from Leslie Benzies took precedence over the development team's ongoing work, disrupting teams' ability to manage their own workflows. Margherita “Marg” Peloso, a former associate producer, also chimed in and stated that any attempts to raise concern were “laughed at in meetings with the bosses.” This resulted in a culture where staff members felt “commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return.” A former audio programmer, Isaac Hudd, mentioned how the rapid feature additions requested at the behest of Benzies at “breakneck speed” were too hasty for proper implementation, resulting in regressions where one team’s additions undid another team’s fixes. Hudd further stated, “And it does mess with you. You really do start to see the morale go down, and the little arguments start to happen. People burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: ‘What's the point?’” Earlier this month, between 250 and 300 BARB staff were laid off, most of whom were based in the Edinburgh studio. The IWGB union’s Game Workers Branch, on behalf of the staff members, announced that it would be taking legal action. For its part, Build A Rocket Boy claims in a statement that it would handle the redundancy process with “care and transparency” before mentioning that it was “committed to learning and growing.” In the statement, the studio further detailed, “Leslie and the entire senior management team take full responsibility for MindsEye’s initial launch. The version of the game that was released did not reflect the experience our community deserved.” Despite shipping hotfixes and Update 4 to address bugs and improve gameplay, former staff like Newbon call the whole situation a “wasted” opportunity for Scotland's gaming scene amid industry-wide layoffs, which have exceeded tens of thousands in recent years. The whole MindsEye fiasco has caused the lead actor to fear for future employment, and IO Interactive is taking a break from its third-party publishing ventures.Buy MindsEye on Amazon BBC

Title: CNN In Flux as Warner Bros. Discovery Mulls Sale: ‘People Want This Phase to Be Over’
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/cnn-sale-warner-bros-discovery-network-staffers/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T00:31:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members With prospective suitors from Comcast to Paramount eyeing CNN’s parent company, network staffers grapple with more uncertainty and hope for a responsible steward rather than a “scavenger” Just days after David Zaslav took the reins of a newly merged Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022, the chief executive shuttered CNN+, a $300 million streaming subscription service that barely got off the ground. Now, as the network prepares for next week’s launch of its streaming successor, “All Access,” Zaslav dropped more big news on staffers: WBD is for sale. Launching yet another streaming service amid another possible deal marks the latest twist in the CNN ownership saga, as the network has shuffled between corporate parents over the past decade, from Time Warner to the AT&T-owned WarnerMedia, in 2018, to the eventual Warner Bros. Discovery, in 2022. With the prospect of more changes coming, the mood inside CNN on Tuesday, one staffer told TheWrap, “is less concern about who buys us and more about the uncertainty of it all,” adding: “I think people just want to know they’ll have a job.” Such anxiety reflects the shifting stewardship and editorial strategies in recent years at CNN as the groundbreaking linear cable network charts its course in the digital world. Another staffer was more blunt: “People want this phase to be over.” Chatter about WBD selling off CNN alone has only ratcheted up amid the company’s decision to open itself for sale either as a whole or in parts, with Zaslav saying in a memo on Tuesday that “multiple parties” expressed interest in the company. This is separate from its prior plan to split into Warner Bros. (HBO Max, its film and television studios) and networks-and-sports-focused Discovery Global (cable networks including TNT and CNN, among others), and potentially accelerates the chaos to come. It’s just the latest bout of turbulence for CNN, which has seen a string of different CEOs since 2021, from Jeff Zucker to Chris Licht and now Mark Thompson, a former New York Times chief executive whose two-year CNN tenure has been focused on carrying the network into the digital age and who faces his greatest test next week with the “All Access” launch. CNN laid off 200 staffers earlier this year as part of a digital-and-streaming pivot and is banking on cord-cutters’ willingness to pay $6.99 a month for a selection of live and on-demand programming. The second staffer told TheWrap that, while their colleagues have sought some level of stability, they’re more eager to see a buyer who wants to let CNN fulfill its digital ambitions and capitalize on its expertise in international reporting. “I don’t think that the folks that have been in charge — beyond Mark Thompson, the folks that write Mark’s checks — have really had a full vision of what CNN can be and what its mission should be going into the future,” the staffer said. “My aspiration is that whoever comes in and buys us has a set of values that they not only communicate to us, but also to the world, and that they foster an independent journalism that we can be proud of.” A CNN spokesperson referred TheWrap to the WBD memo. Now, the network’s future could hinge on another owner, perhaps a company with a major stake in the news business, such as NBCUniversal parent Comcast, or a streamer like Netflix, both of which are reportedly among the interested parties. WBD’s announcement came after it rejected Paramount’s latest bid to purchase the company wholesale this week, according to the Wall Street Journal. Clearly, Paramount has already demonstrated a willingness to shake up a storied news brand, with newly minted CEO David Ellison quickly installing a conservative think tank veteran as a network watchdog and completing his $150 million purchase of The Free Press, opinion journalist Bari Weiss’ contrarian news outlet. Ellison installed Weiss as CBS News’ editor-in-chief, where she immediately leaned into coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, a subject close to her and Ellison. Expanding his reach into a 24/7 cable news operation like CNN would allow Ellison to tap into its expansive newsgathering operation and synergies (CNN primetime staple Anderson Cooper remains a “60 Minutes” correspondent, and “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King led a short-lived talk show with Charles Barkley between 2023 and 2024) while his own Paramount undergoes layoffs, staving off a potential total brain drain of talent. Should Comcast make a play for the combined Warner Bros. Discovery, they would once again gain a cable news network alongside its own broadcast news operation. Comcast is in the process of spinning off its cable networks, stripping NBC News of its cable counterpart MSNBC and forcing the two networks to move forward as distinct brands and without shared correspondents. Given this, Comcast may only be interested in the Warner Bros. studio assets and its valuable IP, so there’s reason to be skeptical CNN would be included in any deal. A potential Netflix acquisition of the whole company would bring the streamer fully into the news business, something its competitors have only toyed with. The company has said previously it would not enter the breaking news business, but as its scale has grown and its stances on other sectors — sports, ad-supported tiers — have changed, its ability to manage a large-scale news organization could prove more successful than Amazon’s subdued election night program with Brian Williams last year or the streaming components launched by ABC, NBC and CBS for their news programs. It would also give Netflix a new avenue to compete with Amazon, which was reportedly considering other ways to break into news, though Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday the company still has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” so it could be more interested in Warner Bros.’ studio and streaming business on its own. Netflix did not respond to an immediate request for comment. While there’s surely uncertainty about CNN’s future, Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino pointed out Sunday that “for all the talk about declining ratings,” the network is “immensely profitable.” “Now I fully understand the concept of cord cutting etc., but the place has a deep news infrastructure, a global presence and it’s in the middle of a restructuring to [adapt] to changes in the way people view news,” Gasparino said. “Moreover it’s still very relevant. People talk about it all the time. It’s in almost every airport and hotel lobby. I speak to bankers all the time, and they tell me this thing has massive potential, probably more so than the Free Press. Zas knows this.” CNN is currently valued at around $5 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, based on approximately $750 million in EBITDA, per the company’s earnings reports, and $1.75 billion in revenue at a 6.5 times multiple. For now, the network soldiers on as Warner Bros. Discovery continues its plan to split its streaming and studios businesses from its networks. But it’s that infrastructure and presence the second CNN staffer wants to see maintained should a sale go forward, one that doesn’t include the yearslong series of questions about what its corporate owners want to do with the 45-year-old news organization. “I hate to evoke Jeff Zucker, because that’s in the past, but when we had a different sort of corporate structure and we had Jeff Zucker in charge, we never heard anything about Time Warner or AT&T,” they said. “That stuff was so beyond anything that impacted us day to day, where now we’ve had, over the last few years, a consistent drumbeat of speculation and analysis about how our corporate ownership looks at us, what they want out of us, how they’re building a strategy around us. From the day that we were purchased, there was a conversation about whether we would be merged down the road, and questions about strategy more broadly, and I don’t think that that helps the process.” The staffer said a new suitor should want to honor CNN’s legacy of reporting, and appreciate its “enormous value if they let us do good work.” “My fear is that, given the landscape, there’s a good chance that a scavenger comes along and rides the wave of cable disintegration and irrelevance and either dismantles us for parts or merges us with something that already has a lot of redundancies and that we see CNN dwindle into irrelevance,” the staffer said.

Title: Amazon Plans to Replace 600,000 Human Workers With Robots, Report Says
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/amazon-plans-to-replace-600000-human-workers-with-robots-report-says/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T00:01:43Z

The retail giant plans to expand its non-human workforce, with the goal of automating 75% of its operations, according to The New York Times. Amazon may use robots to displace warehouse workers in big numbers. Robots have been a staple at Amazon warehouses for more than a decade, performing tasks formerly completed by humans, including picking, sorting and moving packages. Now, Amazon plans to make human labor less necessary in its facilities by replacing more than half a million jobs with robots, The New York Times reports. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. Amazon announced in June that it had hit a workforce milestone of deploying more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment and delivery network, making it about two-thirds the size of the company's human workforce. The Amazon documents show that the company's goal is to automate 75% of its operations, The Times reported. The shift to increase the role of robots in Amazon's warehouse could save the company billions of dollars each year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimated the annual savings to be as high as $4 billion by 2027, according to a CNBC report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. Reducing its size as reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email. "In particular, and as mentioned in The New York Times story, efficiency gains in one area enable us to invest in other areas -- both existing and entirely new ones -- that create additional value for customers. While it's difficult to predict the future precisely, our track record demonstrates that we've consistently been a major job creator while simultaneously investing in upskilling our workforce for evolving roles."

Title: The 3 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For November 2025

Time Published: 2025-10-21T21:30:02Z

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Applied Digital is a rapidly expanding AI data center operator, securing large contracts and building new capacity to meet soaring demand.Broadcom is a strong contender in AI infrastructure, providing innovative, cost-effective custom AI chips that outperform competitors.Eli Lilly dominates the booming diabetes- and obesity-drug markets with blockbuster products and has a robust pipeline of new treatments. It's tough to say for sure which growth stocks will be winners without a crystal ball. But investors may wish to consider investing in AI data center operator Applied Digital, AI semiconductor provider Broadcom and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. These three companies have solid prospects for gains in addition to some better-known companies, such as Nvidia and Palantir. Applied Digital, Broadcom and Lilly have the potential to rise in the short and long term. If they beat earnings targets and raise guidance, their share prices will keep rising. If they tap their strong competitive positions to win more market share, they'll see lasting success. These stocks were selected based on their rapid growth, good chance of exceeding expectations, and strong products and management. If a company is growing rapidly now and has a track record of beating expectations, its stock is likely to rise. However, to sustain those increases over time, a company must innovate. If the company has great products and excellent management, better-than-expected growth is more likely to last. The three best growth stocks are ranked below in descending order of their stock price change in 2025 as of Oct. 21. More generally, the three stocks are ranked from the highest to lowest return and risk. Read on to learn why. Although it is not profitable, Applied Digital has grown rapidly. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenue increased 84% to $64.2 million, exceeding analyst expectations by $14.2 million, CNBC reported. Applied Digital is benefiting from soaring demand for AI data centers. An estimated $350 billion will be spent in 2025 by large cloud services providers called hyperscalers. CoreWeave – a leading AI cloud services provider – recently leased 150 megawatts of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 campus, bringing Applied Digital’s total anticipated contracted lease revenue to about $11 billion over 15 years, CNBC also reported. Strong demand for Applied Digital’s services looks likely to continue at least through 2026. That's one reason, the company is building a 200 megawatt Polaris Forge 2 campus and is in “advanced discussions with hyperscalers,” according to CRN, with management projecting leased capacity for both Applied Digital campuses as high as 600 MW. Broadcom is benefiting from demand for AI infrastructure. In the company’s third quarter of fiscal year 2025, AI semiconductor revenue grew 53% to $5.2 billion. The company is also gaining from a shift in AI chip architecture through Broadcom’s 65% revenue share of application-specific integrated circuits for hyperscalers, according to Ainvest. Broadcom provides hyperscalers with AI chips that deliver faster performance at lower prices than Nvidia’s products. The chip provider’s clients include Google, Meta, ByteDance and reportedly OpenAI, “representing a strategic alternative to purchasing Nvidia's GPUs," CNBC said. More specifically, Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators deliver three to five times better performance-per-watt than Nvidia GPUs at a roughly $20,000 to $15,000 lower per unit cost, Datagravity estimated. Such innovation has enabled Broadcom to exceed Wall Street expectations for eight consecutive quarters, typically resulting in 10% to 20% stock increases on earnings-announcement days, Ainvest reported. Broadcom’s stock price could rise in November. A September announcement of a $10 billion order for the Titan AI inference chip from a fourth hyperscale customer— believed to be OpenAI —demonstrates Broadcom is winning new hyperscale customers. Though this program is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, pre-production revenue and additional design wins could emerge in fourth-quarter 2025 results, Tom's Hardware predicted. Eli Lilly is an American pharmaceutical company combining strong profitability and rapid growth with its market-leading diabetes and obesity treatments. Lilly’s latest financial results, in the second quarter of 2025 showed that revenue rose 38% to $15.56 billion, with net income increasing 91% to nearly $6.7 billion, according to a company release. Lilly dominates the market for diabetes and weight loss drugs. More specifically, Lilly controls about 57% of the U.S. market for incretins – enjoying a competitive advantage over rival Novo Nordisk, Reuters reported. Lilly has experienced rapid growth in demand for two drugs: Mounjaro, which helps manage blood-sugar levels in adults with diabetes, and Zepbound, for treating obesity and weight-related conditions. In Q2, sales of these products grew 68% to $5.2 billion for Mounjaro and 172% to nearly $3.4 billion for Zepbound. The company communicated its optimism about future growth, raising its full-year 2025 guidance above Wall Street expectations. It's projecting $60 billion to $62 billion in revenue and EPS between $21.75 and $23.00 amid strong demand. A new obesity treatment called retatrutide, which is expected to report positive trial results late in 2025, provides another reason for optimism, Pharmaceutical-Journal noted. Moreover, An Alzheimer’s therapy called donanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, was approved in 2025 and could help Lilly exceed investor’s revenue expectations. Investors looking for stocks with upside potential may consider betting on shares of Applied Digital, Broadcom and Eli Lilly. While Applied Digital is losing money and investing to build capacity, its rapid revenue growth and feverish demand from hyperscalers makes it a compelling short-term investment. Broadcom is a much larger, profitable beneficiary of AI chip demand while Lilly’s commanding lead in the booming markets for treatment of diabetes and obesity is propelling rapid growth, which could be even faster if the company shares positive results from new drug trials.

Hyman is an economist and financial analyst specializing in the energy sector. He headed utility equity research at a major brokerage house and… More Info Here is a funny thing about valuation “bubbles” involving financial instruments. In every individual case, you unavoidably end up asking: "What were they thinking?” Or stated differently, what causes a significant part of the supposedly rational investing public to collectively lose their minds for a relatively brief period? A few tulip bulbs, for example, were valued more highly than a modest Amsterdam house in 1637, until they weren’t. Leveraged speculation in frontier commodity markets of Asia and America led to the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Bubble in Europe in the 1720s. The seventeenth and eighteenth-century bubbles were commodity bubbles: tulips, spices, or beaver pelts. But the Railway Mania in the UK in the mid-1840s focused on an amazing new technology, railroads, marketed to the public as risk-free investments. That the British railroad companies' shares ultimately soared and then lost more than two-thirds of their value, immiserating a large portion of the investing public, is almost besides the point. Bubbles always end badly by definition. But the UK’s railway mania is instructive because it was the first truly modern bubble which had all three components of more recent financial bubbles: 1) a new technology, railroads for moving goods and people, the long term economic impacts of which are unclear; 2) financial innovation usually involving leverage or speculation and 3) a government that either participates in the scheme or has little inclination to intervene in financial markets (until it’s too late). Related: Tanker Explosion Off Yemen Deepens Red Sea Security Fears for LPG Trade Using this as a framework, it seems fair to ask if today’s AI stocks, which have substantially outperformed broad market indices, are in a financial bubble? But we’re utility analysts asking this question for a simple reason. The demands for new electric power-generating facilities supposedly required by AI are simply staggering both in amount and expense. For example, the highly respected Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) expects new AI-related electricity demand to reach 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A Deloitte study showed AI electric demand increasing from 4GW now to 123 GW by 2035. And Sam Altman’s Open AI Consortium (including Softbank and Oracle) stated it would need roughly 250 GW by 2033, which at today’s prices would cost over half a trillion bucks to build. (To put these numbers in context, total generating capacity in the USA, presently, is 1,300 GW, growing about 30 GW per year.) All we can say is that with respect to power costs, the AI industry is behaving as if they are either irrelevant or simply a modest expense item, neither of which is true. Utility assets and AI data centers resemble each other in that both are highly capital-intensive, but with one big difference. The heart of a utility is a power plant that lasts forty years (an annual depreciation rate of 2.5%). The primary cost component of a data center is the vast array of computer chips, which have a relatively short life, maybe 2-3 years. A capital asset with a two-year life has a 50% depreciation rate, creating a very large expense item on the income statement, which has to be covered by revenues from the business or by increased corporate borrowing. That still doesn’t make the AI/data center boom a bubble, but it does suggest our next concern. Capital expenditures for AI and data centers seem high. Not just to us. In fact, economists have noted that in the first half of 2025, AI-related capital expenditures contributed more to US domestic growth than consumer spending. This marks a dramatic reversal of prior trends, where consumer spending has been responsible for the bulk of economic activity. All we can conclude here is that this highlights the biggest financial risk for AI investors: will all these new facilities earn a competitive return on all this new, invested capital? Will there be enough revenues to support these new assets? We know the level of planned capex and that there are exciting uses for this technology. We do not know how much people will pay for these services, and therein lies a huge risk. This boom (bubble?) reminds us of the power-generating bubble that burst in the early days of the century. When the power generating market was opened to competition, a host of legacy electricity firms, bankers, entrepreneurs, pipelines, European utilities, and crooks piled in to build a multitude of power plants, encouraged by favorable forward price curves and plenty of low-cost borrowed money. They knew that all the construction (if completed) would produce a power glut, but they all believed that the other guy would back down and not build, thereby preventing an oversupply. Well, the other guys did not back down, demand for power was weak, and carnage followed. There are other related risks here, such as the role of vendor financing. The biggest players in this area (Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Nvidia) are financially robust. But they support an ecosystem of smaller vendors and suppliers who rely exclusively for their infrastructure and software on the aforementioned giants. This creates a circular financing scheme where one group sells products to another wholly captive or financially dependent group while purchasing their services. In a bubble, this is all financed with common stock issuances at ever higher valuations. Which works until it doesn’t. Then the house of cards falls down, as it did in the housing and dot-com bubbles earlier this century. The AI boom assumes that the tech bros in California, choosing an AI strategy, picked the right horse. The Chinese seem to think otherwise, offering less expensive AI solutions to less expensive problems, more or less. Chinese industry has shown, with government help, a remarkable ability to take ideas from abroad and commercialize them into a lower-cost product. AI is in their targets. That may put these huge American AI investments at risk. So don’t start to count the profits. Let’s conclude with these observations about financial bubbles. First, there is a kind of conflation in the term between genuinely nonsensical ideas and those viable corporations whose shares were simply grossly misvalued. When the dot-com bubble burst around the year 2000, the shares of Amazon declined by over 90%. But it is still around, bigger than ever. Pet food supplier Pets.com, on the other hand, which lost money on every sale, is not. If we go back to our original example of the British railway mania of the 1840s, we can observe something similar. Those railroads, which provided an enormous economic boost to a rapidly industrializing British economy, also caused grievous financial injury to a generation of investors because of the wild misvaluation of the fledgling industry employing a radically new technology, the steam engine. But the legacy of that technology bubble was a fully functioning national railway system that still exists. So, after this AI and data center investor euphoria passes, the investors lose their money and the smoke lifts, what remains, just ashes or many valuable, profitable, important businesses?

Title: Trump rebukes “young lady” reporter questioning Argentina bailout as farmers rips his beef deal
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/trump-backlash-beef-trade-deal-argentina/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Rachel Kiley President Donald Trump is facing renewed backlash for his support of Argentina following a tone deaf comment he made about a potential beef trade deal with the country. Trump has been publicly mulling over the possibility of beginning to import beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices at U.S. grocery stores. “If we buy some beef now—I’m not talking about that much—from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country, a very good ally,” he said over the weekend. No deal has officially been made as of yet, but even the idea of it is causing an uproar among farmers who already feel betrayed and misled by the allegedly “America First” president. A reporter recently questioned Trump about this backlash, asking, “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting Argentina more than it does them—” “Look, Argentina’s fighting for its life, young lady,” he said, cutting her off. “You don’t know anything about it. They’re fighting for their life.” He went on to claim that “nothing’s benefiting Argentina” and that he wants to “help them survive in a free world,” before letting his true motivation slip. “I happen to like the president of Argentina,” he said. “I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They’re dying, alright? They’re dying.” The reporter’s identity could not immediately be confirmed. Q: What do you have to say to farmers who feel that the deal is benefitting Argentina more than it is them?TRUMP: Look, Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You understand what that means? They are dying pic.twitter.com/1DMyaHtcTR Trade wars have led to China, previously the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, halting its purchases. Instead, they’re now getting soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration has authorized a $20 billion currency swap for Argentina while U.S. farmers continue to struggle. And Trump himself has repeatedly made it clear that this help is motivated by his ideological allyship with Argentina’s president, Javier Milei. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” he recently said, while warning U.S. financial support for the country would drop if Argentinian politics shift left. Putting this relationship and Argentina’s economy above struggling Americans has angered some farmers, with many worrying that creating a beef deal with Argentina will only exacerbate an already bad situation for rural Americans. “President Trump’s plan to buy beef from Argentina is a betrayal of the American rancher,” Farm Action’s Senior Director of Programs, Christian Lovell, said in a press release. “The U.S. beef industry is dominated by four major meatpackers that control roughly 85% of the market. This consolidation allows them to suppress prices paid to ranchers while keeping consumer prices high. Importing more beef into this rigged system will not lower costs for families or restore fair markets for producers.” As frustrated as farmers may be, there’s been a fair amount of frustration aimed at them from other Americans, as well, considering many of them voted for him despite being warned that it would hurt the economy and their own bottom line. Still, that doesn’t mean people are keen on Trump throwing money at Argentina while gutting American programs—or that anyone was impressed by his condescending response to the reporter who actually asked him about it. The tone of “young lady” here then calling the reporter stupid is quite the combo https://t.co/dC6GDoDXts it’s quite funny that argentina’s current situation is a direct result of Milei’s policy. Farmers: We’re struggling. Trump: Okay, but have you tried being Argentina?MAGA farmers voted for the guy who bankrupted casinos, and they’re shocked he’s bankrupting them too. https://t.co/4Rw1LVBB8c I think the media should be doing a better job of explaining that Argentina is “fighting for it’s life” because they followed right wing policies which caused their economy to collapse. https://t.co/g2sxwYlaKY Why would Trump buy beef from Argentina while US farmers struggle?Maybe it’s because the Trump-connected fund managers at BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco, and his mega-wealthy friends are heavily invested in Argentina.Always follow the money and you’ll find Trump’s corruption. https://t.co/4SM5nFaP4q Just found out that the first A in MAGA stands for Argentina.

Title: Millionaire tax that inspired Mamdani fuels $5.7 billion haul in Massachusetts
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/21/zohran-mamdani-millionaire-tax-massachusetts-5-7-billion/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T17:43:25Z
Full Content:
A millionaire levy in Massachusetts that New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani holds up as a model for taxing the rich has generated $3 billion more in revenue than expected without forcing significant high-profile departures from the state. In the two years since the state started charging a 4% surtax on incomes over $1 million, the effort has created a $5.7 billion windfall, with the surplus being used to fund bridge repairs, bolster literacy programs and address the transportation system’s budget deficit. While other states have progressive tax brackets, the Massachusetts law stands out structurally in its targeting of incomes that exceed seven figures. That has infuriated business leaders who complain it makes the state less competitive and drives away the wealthy. Several are even backing ballot proposals to lower the state income levy and limit how much tax revenue can be collected in any given year as a way to diffuse the millionaire’s fee. Some high-profile names have moved away, including Robert Reynolds, the former chief executive officer of Putnam Investments. But other anecdotes of bold-faced names or companies ditching Massachusetts are harder to come by, in contrast to tales of departures from New York, Chicago and San Francisco. That may change as more Internal Revenue Service data is released in the coming months, potentially bolstering the case for the tax or providing evidence of how it can undermine a state’s appeal to the wealthy. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu — whom Mamdani has called a role model — recently chastised executives for complaining about the tax. She contends that the region’s talent pool and livability are more important to its economic competitiveness. Many high-income taxpayers are staying in the Boston area despite the tax hike. “At the end of the day, I happen to believe it’s a phenomenal place to live,” said Sam Slater, a real estate developer who lives in the Boston suburb of Weston and pays the millionaire’s tax. Slater, 41, could live anywhere: His real estate firm has holdings nationwide. He travels frequently for his side job producing films starring big names like Mark Wahlberg. His holdings including a piece of the National Hockey League’s Seattle Kraken. He even spent part of his childhood in West Palm Beach, Florida, a favorite refuge for wealthy executives looking to flee high taxes and winters. But he’s staying put. His family has roots in the region, and they also like Boston’s culture, sports teams and seasons, Slater said. Josh Isner, president of taser manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc., said the millionaire’s tax makes it harder to recruit talent — particularly well-paid artificial intelligence specialists — to the Northeast hub the company opened in Boston last year. But the office is based in the city because “Boston breeds super-talented people,” he said earlier this year. He lives in Massachusetts, rather than near the company’s headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, where income taxes are significantly lower. That’s largely because Massachusetts schools are so renowned, he said. Massachusetts voters approved the surtax in 2022, with the levy applying to income that exceeds the $1 million threshold. Mamdani, who has maintained a large lead in polls ahead of New York’s Nov. 4 mayoral election, cited the Massachusetts policy as a success story when he floated his own millionaire’s tax proposal. New York may prove different than Massachusetts. The Empire State already ranks dead last in the Tax Foundation’s competitiveness index with rates that are among the highest in the country. And while Mamdani has used billionaires as a foil in his campaign — he wants to raise levies on individuals and corporations to pay for his progressive agenda — Governor Kathy Hochul has ruled out approving increases. In Massachusetts, with a buoyant stock market helping to swell wealthy residents’ taxable wealth, the millionaire’s tax generated an estimated $3 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, more than double what state lawmakers had budgeted, according to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Collections a year earlier similarly exceeded expectations. The surtax has generated $5.7 billion in total. The extra cash has helped Governor Maura Healey ease the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s budget gap at a time when other states are slashing train and bus service. Healey’s now seeking to use $200 million of the money to address President Donald Trump’s cuts to research funding at Massachusetts institutions, one of the biggest threats to the state’s economy. The law that created the tax requires the funds to go toward education and transportation initiatives. “People who thought this tax would backfire will have to concede now that it generates a substantial amount of additional revenue,” said Evan Horowitz, executive director of Tufts University’s Center for State Policy Analysis. Still, he estimates that for every dollar the millionaire’s tax brings in, the state is likely to lose 20 to 50 cents in income taxes from those who leave or adopt tax-avoidance strategies. Those indirect losses are hard to pinpoint, he said. Individuals with incomes over $1 million were responsible for 35% of total payments in Massachusetts in 2022, the year before the millionaire’s tax took effect and the most recent period for which IRS data is available. Some high-profile executives have indeed decamped for lower-tax states because of the surcharge. Reynolds, the former Putnam Investments CEO, cited the combination of the millionaire’s tax and the Massachusetts estate tax. He moved to Florida last year, shortly after Franklin Templeton acquired Boston-based Putnam. The surtax “pushes you to make an earlier decision,” Reynolds said. The 73-year-old finance executive has been a fixture in Boston business circles for decades, having built Fidelity Investments’ 401(k) business before joining Putnam in 2008. He remains on the board of the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, a collection of the state’s most powerful executives. Business leaders continue to warn that even if wealthy residents didn’t abandon the state in droves in the tax’s first years, the departures will add up over time — and ultimately hurt Massachusetts more than it helps. They point out that $1 million incomes don’t go as far as they used to, particularly in a high-cost state like Massachusetts. The median home price in the greater Boston area surpassed $1 million in June before falling back under that threshold again. “I haven’t been to one meeting in Boston since this passed where there haven’t been a number of people saying that they’re moving out of the state,” Reynolds said. Other high-profile Massachusetts residents who have moved are reluctant to blame the tax. Steve Pagliuca, a longtime Bain Capital executive and Boston Celtics co-owner, has said his recent move to Florida was due to family reasons and his retirement from day-to-day work at Bain, not the tax. He recently offered to acquire the Connecticut Sun women’s professional basketball team and relocate it to Boston. In the absence of clear data, supporters and critics of the millionaire’s tax alike have touted studies that support their arguments — even if they don’t tell the full story. A study by a progressive research organization found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts jumped by 39% from 2022 to 2024, with the authors concluding the surtax is an effective policy tool. The report’s data measured wealth, however, not the income figures that determine who is subject to the tax. A separate survey conducted by a business advocacy group this year found that tax policy was the most-cited reason for residents’ moves elsewhere. Few of those surveyed are subject to the millionaire’s tax, though. The outflow of residents to other states also predates the surtax and reflects other factors such as high housing costs. Slater, the real estate developer, has friends who left Massachusetts for places like Florida and Texas — both because of the millionaire’s tax and for other reasons. While he has no plans to follow them, he’s concerned Massachusetts could increase the surcharge or add other taxes in the future. New increases have been on the table this year. Raise Up Massachusetts, the labor-backed group that proposed the millionaire’s tax, is now pushing to increase state duties on corporate foreign income. Healey also proposed new taxes on candy, prescription drugs and synthetic nicotine products — levies that the state legislature ultimately rejected. Should Massachusetts tax wealthy individuals further, Slater said he can’t say with certainty he’d stick around. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Historically, Nvidia has staged multiple powerful rallies - from riding the cryptocurrency boom to capitalizing on the Covid-era gaming and remote work surge. The stock’s latest ascent, fueled by the generative AI revolution that began in 2022 has been the biggest and most transformative wave in the company’s history. In fact, the stock increased by more than 50% within a two-month period on 11 occasions, particularly notable in 2016 and 2024, and rose over 30% during similar times 15 times, including crucial years such as 2017 and 2024. If past patterns persist, forthcoming catalysts could propel NVIDIA shares sharply upward once more, providing considerable profits to investors. Factors That May Elevate The Stock Investing in single stocks can be risky, but there is immense value in a broader, diversified strategy such as the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond just stocks. A portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to stocks and bonds, may yield higher returns over the next 1 to 3 years and offer better protection if markets decline by 20%. We have analyzed the data. Current Financial Overview It's beneficial if the fundamentals align well. For insights on NVDA, read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock. Below are several important figures. But How Does The Stock Perform During Adverse Conditions? Examining NVIDIA’s past during market downturns reveals that there remains considerable risk despite its advantages. The stock declined close to 85% during the Global Financial Crisis and 68% during the Dot-Com bust. The sell-off in 2018 and the inflation shock each exhibited decreases exceeding 55%, with the latter around 66%. Even the relatively short Covid downturn caused a nearly 38% drop in the stock. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market declines, NVDA is not shielded from significant drops. However, risk is not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions—consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines historically. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices—the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have offered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier performance, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Earnings Preview: From Disney’s Kimmel Fallout to Paramount-WBD Drama, Our 5 Biggest Questions

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Expect fresh insight into linear and streaming as several big industry shifts are poised to play out over the coming quarters The final round of quarterly earnings updates for 2025 kick off with Netflix earnings on Tuesday afternoon, followed by Comcast next week and Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Disney in November. The financials will paint the latest picture on where these companies stand as they look to grow streaming profitability amid linear TV’s continued decline. Executives will also have the opportunity to address several major shifts set to take place across the media landscape in the coming quarters, including increased competition from YouTube, the copyright implications from OpenAI’s Sora 2, Comcast’s spin off of its cable network portfolio into Versant and David Ellison’s new vision for Paramount as the company pursues a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which said on Tuesday its fielding interest from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. “We were finally beginning to settle into a position where Netflix has won the streaming wars. It just feels like things are being thrown into flux again,” Third Bridge analyst John Conca told TheWrap. “We’re in a time of disruption.” Disney, Comcast and Paramount declined to comment on this story. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Here are five questions we hope to get more answers to as earnings season kicks off. After ending its quarterly disclosures at the end of 2024, Wall Street will be paying close attention to Netflix’s guidance around engagement, which has become the streamer’s new metric of success as it looks to scale its ad tier. Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese told TheWrap that Netflix is finally at a turning point where the company’s ad tier is poised to become a primary revenue driver in 2026. She noted that Wedbush’s quarterly consumer survey indicates “pretty strong stability” in Netflix subscriber growth. “The retention is largely due to their ad supported tier,” she said. “They have the lowest ad delivery rates of anyone in streaming and I think their ads are becoming more and more relevant as they get better at targeting. That will only get better over time.” UBS analyst John Hodulik expects a 17% increase in revenue and 25% increase in operating income as a result of subscriber growth, higher pricing and increased ad revenues. He believes the return of shows like “Squid Game” and “Wednesday,” as well as new hits like “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Untamed,” will provide a boost to engagement and monetization. He expects that trend to continue with its fourth-quarter slate, which includes “The Witcher,” “Stranger Things” and the NFL Christmas Day games. Netflix will also add video podcasts to its platform in 2026 as part of a new partnership with Spotify, so expect to hear some commentary around that. Though Netflix itself has also been floated as a potential WBD suitor, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth emphasized its “certainly not an acquisitive company” and added that a large, complex deal would “likely bog the company down for an extended period of time and potentially invite regulatory scrutiny.” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters also shaded big media mergers earlier this month, noting they “don’t have an amazing track record.” Disney will report its first earnings results since its temporary suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC and affiliates owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting. The move, which came in response to the late night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, triggered calls to cancel Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscriptions. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich expects Kimmel to have “little impact” on streaming churn in the quarter given the timing of billing cycles, though she predicted there could be a “modest” impact in Disney’s first fiscal quarter of 2026. On the advertising side, Seaport Research’s David Joyce estimated the Kimmel situation could have resulted in a $4.25 million hit, assuming a $30 average cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) and 1.77 million average viewers, but acknowledged that could be easily recouped. Antenna revealed on Monday that the monthly churn rate for Disney+ and Hulu doubled in September to 5% and 10%, respectively, though it’s unclear how much of that was related directly to Kimmel. An insider told TheWrap that Antenna’s percentages are higher than what Disney is seeing internally. “Disney ultimately, and effectively we believe, resolved its controversies over the past couple of weeks, but the immediate follow-on with planned streaming price increases might compound the cancellations and put the +10 [million] net adds guidance at risk — but not likely by a wide margin,” Joyce said. Notably, ESPN+ will no longer report its subscriber and average revenue per user metrics starting this quarter, with Disney+ and Hulu set to follow suit in the company’s first quarter of 2026. An Antenna spokesperson told TheWrap that the estimated cancellation volumes for Disney+ and Hulu totaled 3 million and 4.1 million, compared to the averages of 1.2 million and 1.9 million, respectively, in the last three months. Disney+ had around 2.18 million sign-ups during the month, while Hulu had just over 2.1 million sign-ups, per Antenna. In addition to Kimmel, Wall Street will be paying close attention to any additional financial guidance for 2026, as well as commentary around Disney CEO succession updates, its new ESPN streamer and its impact on cord-cutting, the efforts to combine Disney+ and Hulu into a standalone app in 2026, the financial impact of its NBA rights renewal and loss of F1 rights, the outlook for their linear business, recent price hikes at their U.S. theme parks and the impact from competition with Universal’s Epic Universe. Ellison will finally take questions from Wall Street after the closing of Skydance Media’s $8 billion merger as he and president Jeff Shell outline their vision and provide updates on the company’s efforts to achieve $2 billion in cost savings. Those efforts include thousands of upcoming layoffs which are expected to kick off as soon as next week, a review of its real estate portfolio and finding efficiencies in other areas such as procurement and workflow. Leadership also said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, as well as leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with Larry Ellison’s Oracle and move Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ to a unified tech stack next year. Additionally the company has been investing more in content, setting new media rights deals with the UFC and Zuffa Boxing, new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and striking deals with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers and James Mangold. “It will probably be a few quarters before we really have a good idea of what this vision truly is,” Conca said. “It’s exciting and invigorating that we have seen them make the moves that they’ve made so far, but we don’t know where this might all end up going.” Analysts will also have an opportunity to ask Paramount about its pursuit of all of Warner Bros. Discovery and larger M&A strategy on the heels of its $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. When asked during Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, Ellison dodged talk about the WBD bid, but said he sees “a lot” of “actionable” M&A possibilities in the near-term. “We would approach that through the lens of wanting to make more, not less,” Ellison said. Conca says he’ll also be looking for specifics around Paramount’s content spend, how a WBD acquisition may or may not change the plans for holding onto its linear networks and the timeline for ramping up its content production on the film side. Speaking of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company revealed on Tuesday that it has launched a review of strategic alternatives after “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for both the entire company and Warner Bros., its streaming and studios business that will separate from its linear networks business Discovery Global in April. The review comes as WBD reportedly rejected a $20 per share takeover bid from Paramount for being too low. Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield noted that, assuming the lowest price the WBD board is willing to entertain is $25 per share, the Ellisons could pay around $63 billion with $50 billion in cash, though he doesn’t believe they’d be interested in that option. They could also write a $30 billion check for WBD and raise $20 billion in new debt, along with issuing $12 billion to $13 billion of new Paramount stock to WBD shareholders. Additionally, analysts will be looking for any further guidance around HBO Max’s efforts to grow revenue, profitability and subscribers through its ongoing international expansion and looming password sharing crackdown, as well as the impact of WBD’s loss of its NBA rights to Amazon, NBCUniversal and Disney. Though it wasn’t included in the larger group, Warner notably reached a settlement with the league that will give TNT Sports and its portfolio of brands a global license to create, produce and distribute new and existing NBA content across its platforms, as well as international rights in Northern Europe and Latin America, excluding Mexico and Brazil. Morningstar Research analyst Matthew Dolgin told TheWrap it’s too soon to tell what the overall impact of the NBA loss will be, but that it’s an area he’ll be keeping an eye on. “Their recent pay TV renewals should keep the subscription line steady for now, but the extent of ad revenue declines and cash savings over the next couple of quarters will be important,” Dolgin said. Though many analysts have viewed Comcast as an ideal merger partner for WBD for years, the company faces difficulty in getting a deal done given its upcoming spin off of Versant, as well as the required financing for a competing bid against the world’s second richest man and potential regulatory hurdles from the Trump administration. “I would be very surprised if they were to get involved at this point. It seems like Paramount has the appetite to absorb both and then maybe deal with it later. I don’t see Comcast wanting to do that, at least as of now,” Conca said. “If we’re sitting here a year from now and there’s a full Warner Bros. Discovery unwinding and they’re spun off, I could see Comcast maybe getting involved for the studio piece and Versant getting involved for the cable networks, but I don’t see that now as they’re going through their own organizational reshuffle.” On the flip side, Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino believes that Comcast should “try hard to buy it,” arguing it would have “much to gain” and that it could “fix NBCU’s ~$30B undervaluation.” Supino said Comcast could get around the political and financing challenges by issuing new stock to WBD, eliminating its “super voting” share structure and appointing a new chairman and CEO given Trump’s repeated criticism of Brian Roberts. (Comcast recently announced it would elevate Comcast president Mike Cavanagh to co-CEO alongside Roberts, though the latter said the pair would work together for “years to come.”) He added that NBCU could sweeten its bid with a position for WBD CEO David Zaslav in the combined company. Outside of the WBD bid conversation, analysts will keep an eye out for any positive momentum for Comcast’s broadband business, which has suffered declines in recent quarters due to increased competition, and any further guidance that can be shared about Versant’s outlook. In a first glimpse at its financials ahead of the spin off, Comcast disclosed that Versant’s profits fell 16% to $670 million and revenue fell 6% to $3.42 billion in the first half of 2025. They’ll also be paying close attention to Peacock’s growth and how its recent price increase and NBCUniversal’s new 11-year media rights deal with the NBA may impact its profitability efforts. “With the NBA contract beginning in this year’s fourth quarter, I don’t think third quarter sales, subscribers or profits can be expected to be a trend,” Dolgin said. “We’ll need to wait until next year to see if the NBA is bearing fruit and allowing for a better outlook for Peacock, which we’ve seen as the laggard.”

Title: RKLB Stock To $48?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) has seen a rapid appreciation, jumping 41% over the past month to a current trading price of $67. This surge is likely fueled by several positive developments: improved analyst ratings, higher price targets, and new or expanded launch contracts with Japanese clients. A significant factor is the growing consensus among analysts who now see Rocket Lab as a serious, publicly traded competitor to SpaceX. Despite these strong operational tailwinds and the company’s solid long-term prospects, our machine-driven multi-factor assessment suggests reducing exposure to RKLB stock may be prudent. Our primary concern stems from the stock’s Very High valuation. While Rocket Lab boasts a Strong overall operating performance and financial condition, the recent rapid run-up appears to have factored in most of the near-term positive news. Consequently, the stock is currently deemed Relatively Expensive. Below is our assessment: RKLB stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. Consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors but before that, for quick background: With $35 Bil in market cap, Rocket Lab provides launch services and space systems solutions, designing and manufacturing small orbital launch vehicles and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government customers. This table highlights how RKLB is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Valuation Ratios This table highlights how RKLB is growing vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Revenue Comparison This table highlights how RKLB profitability vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Operating Income Comparison RKLB saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read RKLB Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

October 21, 2025 9:00am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Henry Ward, Carta Chief Executive Officer, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio this Barry Ritholtz: This Week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Henry Ward, is CEO and co-founder of Carta. They’re the company that keeps track of cap tables, compensation, valuation, liquidity for over 50,000 private companies. They work with 8,500 investment firms and over two and a half million equity holders to track all of this crucial information. It’s kind kind of hard to imagine that they were doing this manually with stock certificates before Carta came along and digitized everything and put it all on the cloud. Fascinating company. Fascinating guy. I thought this was really a great conversation. With no further ado, the CEO and co-founder of Carta Henry Ward, welcome to Bloomberg. Henry Ward: Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: Well, thanks so much for doing this. It’s been a crazy week with the UN and everything, so I’m glad you, you guys fought your way over. But I wanna start talking a little bit about your education and background. A bachelor’s in mathematics and computer science from University of Michigan, go Blue and MSC in market finance from EDHEC. I am less familiar with Ed Heck than I am with Ish. What was the original career plan? Henry Ward: You know, I went to University of Michigan originally to be a math major. Technically, my, my degree on my transcripts has a bachelor’s of general studies. ’cause at that time to get a math degree, you were in the literature of Science and Arts College and you had to take two years of a foreign language. And I failed Japanese three times, tried Spanish, failed that twice. And my counselor was, and at the time I was supposed to go in the Marines and they said, look, I said to my counselor, you, I just need to graduate. And they said, well, look, if you switch to a general studies degree, you can, you can graduate. ’cause you have enough credits. It’s kind of a generalist degree. ’cause you took a bunch of math, computer science and linguistics and you can graduate next year. And, and I said, let’s do that. So it was me and 13 football players that graduated with a general studies degree that year. But, but the, my passion had always been math. I thought I’d be a mathematician. My roommate was a computer scientist. He got me into computers and, and then I went into software engineering. Barry Ritholtz: So two questions. First, did you end up in the Marines? Henry Ward: I joined the Marines out of high school as an enlisted man. I, I went to Paris Island and then I later went into what’s called Platoon Leaders course, which is like the Marine Corps version of rotc. I did that. But when I finally graduated, and sometimes I, I regret this, you know, you kind of look back at old decisions and at the time, four years, four more years and the Marines seemed like an eternity. Right now it seems like nothing book of an eye Barry Ritholtz: Would be, it would be gone, right? Henry Ward: Yeah. I ended up deciding to pay back my, my GI bill because this was 2000. I graduated in 1999. My signing bonus paid off my entire college debt at the time, and I decided to go that route. So I, I never Barry Ritholtz: Where was the signing bonus? Where’d you go? Henry Ward: I went to a company called Trilogy out Austin, Texas. And it was an incredibly formative experience for me. I it was a very smart company. They, they were gonna be the Google of the South for a variety of reasons. It didn’t quite work out for them. They, the CEO is still there though, running Trilogy and it’s a great private privately held company. But yeah, that’s what took me into, into Texas. Barry Ritholtz: So I hear you saying you didn’t do well with languages with Japanese, with Spanish, but am I reading this correctly? Did you get your masters, your MSC in France? Henry Ward: Yeah, I did because the, the business schools in France are mostly taught in English. Huh. And English is hard enough for me. So I had to, I had to stick with, with an English business school. The plan was never to go to business school. I, I wanted to ride my bicycle in southern France. It was a big tour to France. Watch here. I loved riding my bike. My fiance now, ex ex-wife was like, well, hey, if we’re gonna go, I convinced her to come with me. We’re gonna be productive. Let’s go to business school while you train for the Iron Man and do all those things. And, Barry Ritholtz: And you did all of that? Henry Ward: Yeah. So we, we, but it was a French business school, so there wasn’t a lot of work. There was a lot of riding, a lot of, a lot of eating bread. It was, it was a great couple years. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a kind of fascinating mix of technical, financial, financial training, Marines and overseas study. How did that experience shape the way you think about building companies? Henry Ward: You know, I, I realized pretty quickly, I, I, I’m not good at the military. My father was an army officer for a long time, and he used to tell me, you know, and the difference between military life and civilian life is in military life, you’re, you’re judged on the, the worst thing you do in civilian life, or certainly in startups. You’re judged on the best thing you do. And, and I’m very much, I do one or two things really well versus I do many things, you know, not wrong. And so I quickly realized the military was not not the right place for me. Investment banking was not the right place for me. I, I went to an investment bank after grad school, and then I discovered entrepreneurship sort of accidentally. And I, I realized this is what I was meant to do. Successful or unsuccessful. This is what I was meant to do. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the predecessor firm to Carta second site, a portfolio optimization platform. You launched that not long after grad school. How did that experience influence how you approached the next venture? How did it affect what your plans were for scaling Carta? Henry Ward: The idea for second site was, it was like a wealth front or a betterment, one of these robo-advisors. But you know, Andy and Josh did a, a much better job than I I did, my company failed. And what I, what kind of rose outta the ashes of that was, and I got through the tr of depression after closing. It was, I couldn’t imagine doing anything else as a completely failed founder. I just wanted to do it again. And Carta came out of that experience. And it, it was one of these interesting things where the conventional wisdom for founders is you fall in love with a problem and entrepreneurship is a vehicle with which to that solve that problem. I was different. I fell in love with entrepreneurship. I fell in love with building a startup, and I just needed a problem. The problem was a vehicle with which to be a, a founder. And that really shapes how Carta is today. We’re a heat seeking missile going after any problem we can find to solve to keep the business moving forward. And, and I, I talk a lot to early stage founders about this, is which one are you, are you in love with the being a founder? Are you in love with the problem? And both come with strengths and weaknesses. If you’re in love with being the, in the problem, you know, you’re passionate about the problem, you’ll grind through the, the bad stages of being a founder to solve this problem. The, the downside is if the problem isn’t actually that valuable, you kind of get stuck entrenched in this problem, right? And many founders burn and crash in that. The other side for me is, you know, because I’m not, I’ll do, I’ll work on any problem to, to move the company forward. There’s often not a coherent strategy. It’s like, I’ll grab a problem over here, I’ll grab a problem over there. And, and you can see it in the kind of diversity for, for a $500 million business, we have a, a large number of SKUs and business lines. And it’s because we shoot at a lot of different targets. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the initial target. How did you come up with the idea, hey, these cap tables, all the data around comp and valuation and VC investing. No one is really tracking this in a consistent, intelligent way. Like, what was that aha moment? Henry Ward: I was working with Manu Kumar over at Canine Ventures on the, my previous company. And when we shut that down and, and we were talking about what am I gonna do next? He pointed out this cap table problem and, and was like, Hey, this is a real problem. I think you should solve it. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That’s fascinating. I’ll, I’ll invest in it. And, and he, he gave me this, this problem set to go after. And I, I spent a few months working on it and learning about it. What was really interesting was the first version of it was not cap table. So that’s what everybody knows us for. The first version actually was PayPal for equity. It was, instead of, back then you used to mail a paper stock certificate, just like we used to do with the railroads, right? And it cost $50 in FedEx fees and a hundred bucks for the paralegal to print it. Barry Ritholtz: And somebody had to file it in a cabinet. And we were like, we said, Hey, why are we email or, you know, FedExing paper stock certificates, let’s just email it. And, and that was the initial idea. And we realized companies didn’t care that much. We thought the competition was FedEx. They didn’t care that much about it, but they said, well, hey, if you’re, you’re emailing all this stuff, can you just put all of it into a table and show it to me? And we’re like, yeah, we can do that. That sounds pretty good. And that was the thing that had product market fit, was just showing them everything we issued. And then once you had the cap table of the company, my, my heat seeking missile instincts were like, well, what else could we do? And then we launched four nine A and stock option expense accounting and employee management and cart total compensation and QSBS. And suddenly you could do so many things around this core system of record called the Cap Table. Huh. Barry Ritholtz: So fascinating. What was it like scaling that? What sort of technology issues did you run into? How much of the data you were finding? Was it all hand assembled or was there any mass amount of data that made it easy to navigate? What, what were the next few steps ? Henry Ward: I often tell earlier stage founders, you know, being a, you know, we’re about 2000 employees now. The problems I deal with are no different than the early stage. They’re just bigger, faster, harder. But they’re the same, same set of problems. I I do the same thing every day than an early stage founder does. And it’s really simple. It’s talk to customers, figure out their problems, solve the product, build the product to solve their problems and make them happy. And that’s just it. It is just rinse and repeat. Everything else is just, you know, overhead to building a, a a, building a company. And so these days, you know, I’m in New York for, for a few days, half my meetings are our customer meetings. Barry Ritholtz: So this isn’t just obviously public companies. This is public and private companies. How do they differ? My assumption is it’s easier to track and access public companies data. What do you do on the private side? Henry Ward: Public company data and, you know, Bloomberg’s a a great, you know, example of this is, is so ubiquitous and it’s how do we manage this incredible set of data across massive ecosystems and networks in the public markets. Private markets is very different. It’s, it’s private there, there’s no central place to access all this data. We have a lot of the data on what’s happening in the private markets, particularly around venture capital and private equity. But because it’s private, we can’t share it. And that is the very unique interesting thing about what we do is we track all the much of the same data that like a Bloomberg would track, but we can’t share it with anybody. And that’s the, that’s, many people have asked me, Hey, how come you haven’t done blockchain? You know, blockchain seems like an obvious thing for a cap table to be put on. And the reason is our, our customers pay us to fix things when they’re broken. And don’t tell anybody about, tell, don’t tell anybody about it. And blockchain is immutable and public. And that’s, that’s the big difference between private and public. Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. What was the hardest problem in assembling a private market set of data and cap tables across the whole technology ecosystem? Henry Ward: The big issue we had early was what I’ll call the dematerialization of, of private stock. So the, the model that we think we look at is when Nixon pulled us off the gold standard, he dematerialized cash. You know, now the Federal Reserve could just create cash because cash was now put into the cloud. They could create money, they could do what, they could move money around without actually moving physical inventory. They dematerialized cash and gold and put it in the cloud. And this was in the seventies. We think of us as doing the same thing. Was everything in private markets until Carta was, was cash, it was paper equity, it was contracts, it was PDFs, it was documents. And we dematerialize that. We put it all in the cloud. So now everything could be moved around seamlessly. Getting the ecosystem of venture capital to believe in the dematerialization of private, private equity and private capital was the hardest part. ’cause it sounds crazy today, but in 2012 and 13, lawyers were like, no, but you, you have to have a, a green stock certificate with an embroider around it. Like that’s what we’ve been doing literally for 200 years. I would like, who are you to change this? Barry Ritholtz: I would’ve thought if anybody would be amenable to let’s go from physical paper to digital, it would be Silicon Valley venture capitalists. They were pushing back or their lawyers were pushing back. Henry Ward: The Lawyers are pushing back. But, but even the venture capitalists, ’cause the, the venture capitalists are, they’re very interesting because they are stewards of what the future will be and prognosticators of it, but they’re not users of it. And it’s one of these things I I say a lot about AI is everybody thinks AI will change everybody’s job except their own. And, and venture is the same. Like, oh, you know, all the companies should be using technology, but we don’t because we’re just pros. Barry Ritholtz: we’re the professionals. We don’t need it. Exactly. We’re smarter than everybody else. Exactly. What was the aha moment where that ecosystem that was kind of pushing back said, oh, this is really useful and helpful. Yes, let’s dematerialize, let’s go digital. Henry Ward: It was the grassroots, the the way we got it going was the grassroots efforts of startups saying, Hey, they, they didn’t understand that they were buying into a dematerialization model, but what they understood was, Hey, I can track my cap table cheaper, faster, better on Carta than anything else. And so they just came, came to us. That was the wedge, the net, the kind of the golden phrase is, you know, come, come for the tool, stay for the network. So the tool, the wedge was just better cap table management for one 10th of the cost. And then the network is, once everybody started converging on the cap tables, it became the new standard. So now it’s a weird world, just like, it’s a weird, weird, weird world to say that, you know, know we had paper stocks there to give it and that was the right way to do it. It is now a weird world to say, oh well why wouldn’t we put it in the database on the cloud? Barry Ritholtz: And that becomes a self-reinforcing flywheel. You get a critical mass and then you could go out in, in all sorts of directions from from there. Henry Ward: That’s right. And nobody knows that better than, than Bloomberg and Mr. Bloomberg. ’cause that’s exactly what Bloomberg did. Barry Ritholtz: That’s exactly right. Started with the data… Coming up, we continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carta, talking about how a simple cap table management became an essential part of the startup world ~~~ Barry Ritholtz: My extra special guest today is Henry Ward. He is the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage cap tables and so much more when it comes to both public and private corporate data. So let’s talk a little bit about this. You start with a simple capital table management kind of unglamorous, but sounds important, essential. Hey, I need to know how many shareholders I have, who owns what, what VCs, what, what employees own, how much stock, like I would’ve thought that was around for 30, 40 years. How has nobody been doing that for, you know, you could practically go back to, you know, the launch of Intel 40 years ago. How has this not been a thing? Henry Ward: The one of the most common questions I got when I was raising money in the early days for this idea was, hey, this sounds kind of obvious. Why has nobody done this before? Right. And I, I, my answer was somewhat cheeky. And I, I always would say, how, how would I know I’m doing it? And you know, I’m the last person in the world that would know the answer to this. You should ask the SE 6.9 billion other people in the world that haven’t done it. Who chose not to, right. Who chose not to. And I’m, I’m a least qualified person. I, I think it’s just one of these inner innovator dilemma problems that the people that should have solved this should have been the investment banks. That should have been the ne the stock VCs. Stock exchanges vc, sure. Maybe even the VCs. Yeah. Somebody, somebody should have solved it, but you know, who’s going to do paper stock certificates? Like it just, it’s so somebody Barry Ritholtz: Had a clerk had to have a clerk or a junior researcher putting this together somewhere and had to realize there was some value to both the firm and various outside startups for, it’s kind of shocking Henry Ward: For sure. But, but the, your, your point so well made, Barry is the kind of person that would be filing paper stock certificates would never come up with the idea of replacing them. And so you, you need this, this is the magic of a, a founder, a visionary founder is, is you need that connection of they, they know enough about technology to, to know what technology can do, but they don’t know enough about the current process that they think it’s unchangeable. And that’s the, you, you know, there’s certain level of intelligence and a certain level of stupidity that you need to get that, that chemical quotient. Right. Barry Ritholtz: So how did you convince investors that, hey, this is worthwhile, this should exist. It doesn’t, please invest in this. It’s worth building. Henry Ward: Most investors said, Hey, the, the even I believe you can build a cap table product and make some money and sell it, but it, the, the market size is too small. How many cap tables can you actually sell? And the, the pitch was, well, hey, this is, this is a two-part story. Part one is win the cap tables. Part two is if you win the cap tables, then we can go build at the time what we called the NASDAQ for private markets. The, the stock exchange to trade the, these, these shares. And our thesis then was the reason why there were many stock market companies before us, but none of them had actually owned the settlement. They hadn’t owned the cap table itself. And so they had to connect, match, and settle these things offline. And by owning the cap table, we could digitize the entire settlement process for these companies. But we, you had to do the hard work of winning the cap table business first. We were wrong. It turned out the cap table business was way bigger than we and investors thought. Today it’s a $350 million business. Wow. But the, the stock market that everybody thought was gonna be, you know, a billion dollar business is zero for us. 00:19:37 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s unbelievable. Yeah. The, you know, VCs love to toss around tam, total addressable market. Again, kind of shocking that people right in the middle of this surrounded by tens of thousands of companies in California and Silicon Valley completely underestimated the total addressable market. Yeah. That, that’s just shocking to me. Let’s talk about the, the income stream you set up in the beginning. This was a fee per stock certificate business. You guys changed this to a subscription model. Tell us about the factors that drove those changes and how it affected the steadiness of your income stream. 00:20:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we, we thought we were competing against FedEx. And so instead of paying $60 to FedEx to FedEx a stock certific, you’ll pay us $20 to email it. It worked. People would pay for it. What was really hard about it though is it’s a transactional business. It’s very hard to, to manage the transactional business. And it was very volatile. And we also quickly realized that we wanted to move to a subscription based business. ’cause we needed to bundle other things that were, were more subscription based, like 4 0 9 a valuations and expense accounting and other services we were doing. But we were, we were two years in and, you know, at the time I think we had maybe 2000 customers that were all paying us 20 bucks. And we realized this was like a, a crucible moment for us. If we didn’t change the business model, we wouldn’t, we wouldn’t survive. 00:21:06 And we emailed all of our customers from me. I emailed all 2000 customers and I said, Hey, I made a mistake. I I priced this wrong for you and I I need to change from the $20 per certificate to, you know, X dollars per year. And, and everybody had a, a price that they, we custom already set up for them. So we didn’t even ask ’em, we just said, we’re moving you starting next month to the subscription model. And it was a very scary, scary thing to do. ’cause you don’t know what your customers are gonna do. Right? You, you literally changed the agreement in the mid-flight. And I, I explained in this long email, I said, I, I made a mistake. If I keep charging you this way, I’m gonna go outta business and I need to move you over to this. And I’m very sorry I made this mistake. I hope I understand if you decide to leave us, but I hope, I hope you won’t. And it was remarkable. We lost almost no customers. Wow. And I, I have some of these saved and framed where customers came back and said, you know, we’re so glad you did this ’cause we were wondering if you were gonna run out of business. Like we thought, you know, this pricing was wrong. It didn’t make any sense making, 00:22:19 [Speaker Changed] So the subscription model allows them to just keep doing repeat business and no one has to track, oh, we did these six companies and it’s however much it is. No, here’s our monthly fee and we can do as many companies as we have to work 00:22:33 [Speaker Changed] With. They, they have a monthly ex annual fee for most of them. They pay annually, they, they renew and based on the size of the cap table at that renewal, they, they just get a renewal notice. And, and it’s interesting, you know, eight years ago we were 10 x cheaper than the lawyers. Now we’re still eight x cheaper than the lawyers. But now it’s, it’s just a different, different world. People are used to software now. And it’s, it’s that, that, you know, 10 years ago is a, is a weird thing for these companies to pay a subscription fee for legal software. And today it’s super, super common. Do 00:23:06 [Speaker Changed] You really think about this as legal software? It, I mean it obviously has ramifications in law, but it really seems more like it’s a combination of hey, it, it’s business, it’s investing, it’s accounting. How, how do you contextualize what space you’re actually in 00:23:26 [Speaker Changed] It? It’s a great question. I I think we started as legal software and people thought of us as legal software. I think over the first five years we transitioned the concept of cap table from a legal solution to a financial solution. So we sort of categorize ourselves in the FinTech world. I think today, when you look at cap tables, our fund administration and fund accounting business, our LP business and all the, the, the software that we sell as a platform into private, private equity, private credit venture capital. I, I think of us now as a, as a software infrastructure business, you know, we, we, we sell, we’re we’re more similar to a NetSuite or even a Google suite than we are to a legal tech company or a 00:24:12 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense and save on legal fees. So, so back, let’s call it about eight years ago you were called e shares, which kind of intuitively makes a lot of sense. What was behind the rebranding? Why did you go from eShares to Carta in 2017? 00:24:31 [Speaker Changed] The, we liked eShares because it, it was an electronic share, you know, instead of paper. And it made a ton of sense. In 2017, we kind of realized we wanted to do way more than electronic shares. So we knew we needed a new name. We were also pushed on it because we didn’t own eshares.com. We owned eShares inc.com and there was a domain squatter on eshares.com. 00:24:55 [Speaker Changed] What did they want for it? 00:24:57 [Speaker Changed] They wanted, initially I think it was a million bucks when we had, we had $2 million raised total. And then as soon as we raised more money, it became $10 million. Oh really? And so it was just every single time we were trying to get more and we just couldn’t, couldn’t do business. And so we decided we needed to change the name and we came up with Carta and we were able to buy it for I think 75,000 bucks. And it was great. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Wow. That’s fantastic. Did, did eShares ever get sold? 00:25:25 [Speaker Changed] I don’t think so. It is a great question. I don’t know if it’s still, I haven’t been there in a long time. It 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Just goes to show you, you know, you have to leave a little bit on money on the table if you try and squeeze every last penny end up with nothing. Exactly. So you guys, I mentioned in the original introduction, Carta serves 50,000 companies, 8,500 firms, millions and millions of equity holders. Starting out with that first $2 million raise, it appears that you’ve scaled from a, a little niche solution to a giant platform for private companies. What was the biggest growth pains in in that scaling that up? 00:26:04 [Speaker Changed] It’s all of them. We scaling a company, I, I think I, I love Jensen at Nvidia and I got to see ’em speak and you know, someone was asked him about would he do it again? And, and you know, he’s one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our generation. And he goes, if I knew what it would take, I wouldn’t have done it again. Really. And yeah, and you know, it’s, I think Mark Andreessen calls it, it’s, it’s eating glass until you, you enjoy the taste of your own blood. So it, it’s, you know, ev every day I, there’s sort of this funny thing where people are like, well what was it like to scale? And I’m like, I’m still doing it. Like, like we’re, you know, and, and it’s, you know, getting in at, you know, 10 o’clock last night from a 4:00 AM start. It’s, you know, talking to customers, it’s hiring, firing, you know, uncomfortable conversations, you know, board mechanics. It’s, it’s all the same. It’s just more harder, faster. 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] Is andreessen’s quote eating glass till you like the taste of your own blood? Is that accurate? Or is it a little hyperbolic? 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] You know, I think, so I talk a lot to founders about this, where the, the founders that want to be founders for the money, we all know that the expected value of being an entrepreneur is, is below pursuing a career far, far below the better business bureau 00:27:22 [Speaker Changed] Actually well sold such a large percentage fail Exactly at the gate. So that’s exactly, we all the survivorship bias of, we see the ones that have succeeded. That’s just the top of the iceberg. You don’t see everything below the waterline. A 00:27:33 [Speaker Changed] Hundred percent. And then when you see the ones that succeeded, sort of by definition the ones that succeeded, made it look easy, right? Because it’s like we’re on podcasts doing, doing all of these things. They 00:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Found the right niche, they pivoted appropriately. They built what was needed and the market rewarded 00:27:49 [Speaker Changed] That. That’s exactly right. How hard could it be? That’s exactly right. And and when I look at my history, I know how lucky I got. Like there’s so many forks in the road that, boy, if I had flipped heads instead of tails, I would not be here. And I had, I had to flip, you know, I had to flip tails 32 times in a row to get to, to where I am. 00:28:08 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna, let me interrupt you a second ’cause I just have to share this. So I’ve done oh 550, 600 of these and I have heard that exact thing over and over again. And the first couple of times I heard it, especially from billionaires, I’m like, yeah, yeah, false humility. But then when I start hearing it from more people, from guys like you who are in the trenches chewing on glass, it’s like, and my own experience as an entrepreneur, you really smart and hard work is just table stakes. You really have to get lucky. And people don’t understand how the role of serendipity in, in how things work out. 00:28:46 [Speaker Changed] One, one of my favorite other quotes is Bo bo Durham, the comedians said, you know, don’t take advice from successful people. ’cause it’s, it’s like listening to Taylor Swift say, follow your dreams. You know, or, or the lottery winner goes, you know what you should do, sell everything you own and buy lottery tickets. That’s right. And 00:29:04 [Speaker Changed] That’s an XKCD. They told me I would never win, but I kept at it. That’s right. And here I am today. Exactly. No, it’s, it’s a hundred percent true. Listen, there’s so much more signal in the failures than there are in the successes. ’cause success. Maybe it was skill, maybe it was luck. We don’t know. 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I, what I try to coach like in my angel investments is it, I call it, you know, the love of the game. And so, you know, you see founders that I wanna be successful, I wanna be a successful founder. I wanna make the money. You know, and, and what I always tell ’em is like, hey, the, the problem with money doing this for the money is most of your journey, if not all, you’re poor, right? You’re seed stage, early stage, you’re just poor. And so if you’re doing it for the money, you, you kind of quickly lose motivation. ’cause you’re poor for years, right? And then let’s say you’re one of the lucky for you to get successful. Well, well now you’re rich. And so if you do it for the money now, now you just, you have no reason to do it anymore. ’cause you’ve got the money and the, the, the people that that, that are successful over time in this business, do it for the love of the game. Like I, you know, I do it because I love chewing glass. 00:30:09 [Speaker Changed] My, you know, my wife and I were having a conversation the other day about when we were poor and I mean really poor. And the really challenging thing is when you’re in the thick of it, you don’t know that it’s gonna work out. You have no idea, Hey, am I gonna get that lucky break? Is the right client, partner, customer gonna come along and and give me that critical mass to go to the next level? So not only are you poor, but the outcome is wholly unknown. And so if you don’t love it, then what are you, what are you doing? 00:30:42 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. You’re poor and you’re, it’s an you’re living in constant uncertainty. 00:30:46 [Speaker Changed] Uncertainty. Absolutely. 00:30:47 [Speaker Changed] And I think what people forget is, you know, I, I’m not poor anymore, but I still live in uncertainty and, you know, I don’t know what’s gonna happen. You know, I’m trying to build a bigger business, you know, and, and the water watermark keeps going up. And so like, if, if in three years the watermark isn’t higher, I I will feel like I failed the last three years. And I, I think that’s the, you know, that’s the essence of being entrepreneur is the watermark keeps going up and you keep going up. 00:31:11 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating. I want to dive into the world of, of private companies and alts, but before we do that, I just had to ask you a data question. My, my assumption is accessing reliable and clean data has to be the lifeblood of what you’re doing. How challenging is that? How many different inputs do you guys have to track at Carta? 00:31:37 [Speaker Changed] I have a perspective on, on software and data businesses that might be a bit provocative, which is, I’ll make this statement that software businesses cannot be data businesses. And the reason is, if a software business has customer data, they get that customer data by selling software and and service to this customer. And if they monetize that data on the other side, if their left hand is, we will keep, keep your data confidential and as part of our software service to you. But then with the right hand they’re selling that data, it cannibalizes their software business. ’cause the customers won’t trust them now ’cause they’re now giving ’em their data. Which is why Carta does not have a data product. We have tons of data. We do not have a monetizable data product. Huh, interesting. We only sell workflow or business operation software. The, the, it’s hard to think of a business that sells actual software and also sells data. I I can’t think of any, even Bloomberg started really as a data data business. The, the non-existent, non-existence of something is not proof that it cannot exist. But my my best example of why my theory that software businesses and data businesses cannot coexist in one company is Salesforce. If anybody would launch a data product, 00:32:55 [Speaker Changed] So funny. That’s who exactly it would be 00:32:56 [Speaker Changed] Salesforce was thinking of. And in 30 years they have not. And I don’t think they ever will. And I think the day Salesforce launches a successful data business, I I will be eating my words and I will be wrong, but I don’t think software businesses can become data businesses. I 00:33:11 [Speaker Changed] I would imagine that, so we use, in my shop, we use Salesforce as our CRM very customizable. And they have specific industries that they, they market towards and and customize. But the moment it feels like your data is being reused, every single one of their competitors would say, we keep your data safe. We don’t monetize the data. Give ’em up on them. Come to us where we respect privacy. I mean, I think the moment anybody tries that their competition is all over that. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] And, and you would agree because suddenly you’re now on every list of every vendor trying to sell software to bury and they know everything about you. ’cause Salesforce gave them your data. 00:33:52 [Speaker Changed] Not only that, but it’s not quite hipaa. But the SEC has privacy requirements. Things you’re not allowed to share when you, you’re supposed to know your client. You have all this data. And if one of your vendors is reusing that, repurposing that data for their own ends, like, wait, not only are you violating our privacy agreement, you’re putting me underwater with the SEC, they may come yell at me. I I don’t need that. Totally. I’m I’m gonna go to your competition. Kind of interesting. So, so let’s, let’s pivot towards the private markets. ’cause it’s so interesting. You’ve testified before Congress that’s startups and growth companies backed by private capital. That’s where most of the new job growth comes in the United States. Explain. 00:34:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, public markets is, is actually a shrinking industry. You know, there’s fewer public companies today than there were 10 years ago by, by quite a big margin. But the number of private companies is growing astronomically and be, that’s largely fueled by there’s a lot more private capital than there used to be to fund these businesses. And there’s less reasons to, to, to go public now. So I think, I think that will continue to be true. I think it’s structurally true. When I go to the, to the hill and, and talk to our legislators, the, the common response is, well, we just have to push more companies to go public. I, I think it’s like what the, their, their belief is the public markets is a great product for everyday Americans to access growth equity. And I think they’re right. It, it is a good product for it. The problem is it’s not the, it’s a shrinking product and most of the growth is being hap is happening in the private markets. And there are attempts to get these companies to go public so that there can be retail access to them is isn’t working. It’s a little bit like, you know, the river’s coming and you’ve got like one tiny little dam trying to hold the water back. Let, 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] Let me share a data point that I bet a lot of listeners are not familiar with the US is something like four to 5% of the global population where something like 24, 20 5% of the global economy, global market cap we’re over half. I mean, we are wildly disproportionate in our public markets. How much bigger does Congress wanna make that? I mean, what you’re describing makes a lot of sense. The public markets are enormous. Let’s let the private markets grow and see where they go. 00:36:16 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And that’s certainly the, the, the message that that, that we’re pushing, we still have to solve the problem of, of retail access because as the number of public companies is, is shrinking. That’s less, less and less options for your everyday American to invest their money in their retirement. I don’t think the answer is to try to push more companies to go public. I think the answer is to create safe access for everyday Americans into private capital. And that’s what we spend a lot of time lobbying for in Congress. 00:36:45 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating coming up. We continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carter, talking about the rise of private company investing. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:37:16 I am Barry Reho. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Henry Ward. He’s the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage the cap tables for tens of thousands of private companies, thousands of investment firms and millions of equity holders. They do a number of other things in terms of tracking, compensation, valuation, liquidity, all these really fascinating issues. So there are a number of companies that bring liquidity to private companies. Sometimes it’s it’s private equity or, or some form of a private fund. Other times it’s individuals who wanna participate in companies before they go public. What are your thoughts on the future of secondary liquidity, both for the investors and employees of startups and for the rest of the investing public that wants to participate in these privates? 00:38:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I am, I think I’m one of the maybe top five people in the world that have worked on private market liquidity. I, I spent the, the last 10 years working on the, on the problem. And I, I’m of the view now that that at least venture startup liquidity will, will never happen. And, and at least a, a secondary exchange in the, in the sense that we think of public market exchanges, the private markets are so different from public, it’s really kind of the upside down world. You know, in, in public markets, the the price is set by the last buyer, not the first in private markets. It’s set by the first and not the last. And public markets, it’s easier to sell one share than a hundred million dollars worth of shares in private markets. Easier to sell a hundred million dollar block than it is to sell one one share. You know, in public markets the distribution outcomes is mostly Gaussian normally distributed in private markets. It’s it’s power law. So all the math that exists to, in modern portfolio finance theory in public markets doesn’t work in private. So it, it is just, it’s a very different market infrastructure. I I think all the attempts they try to create liquidity in the, in the venture world are, are, will be failed attempts. But I hope I’m wrong, I hope I’m just old. I 00:39:27 [Speaker Changed] Mean, equity Zen seems to have figured this out a while ago. They seem to have put together a way to do secondaries for creating some liquidity for, for insiders or employees at companies. But it’s not like they’re a trillion dollar platform. It’s, it’s a little bit of a niche specific focused. And there are other companies like that. I just happen to be thinking of them recently. But really what you’re saying is there’s a gulf between trillions and trillions of dollars in public equity and private stock and, and never the twain shall meet. So 00:40:05 [Speaker Changed] In, in public markets liquidity begets liquidity. And so it centralizes on two exchanges in the US and most regions it centralizes on one in, in private markets. What’s happened is there’s equities and there’s many others. There’s many, many small niche businesses doing secondaries. It does happen, but liquidity does not. But beget liquidity, the, as soon as one of these companies starts to scale, all the competitors come around and they devolve back down to a niche business. And and that’s just the, the, the market structure is that any company that actually starts to scale in their private markets, it actually the it degenerates there. The, we’ve seen so many examples of com of private market liquidity providers, you know, come in hot, get really a quick start and then, and then once they hit scale it falls down. And so you see so many of these small businesses that will always stay small businesses. I don’t think there’s an opportunity for someone to consolidate the market. 00:41:03 [Speaker Changed] There’s been so much focus on privates and alternatives. D does this intensity of interest, does this surprise you at all or you’ve been up to your chin in this for, for a decade and what took everybody so long? 00:41:17 [Speaker Changed] We, we’ve been in this up to up to up to my chin as you say, for for a decade plus. So it’s, it’s not surprising. What I think is really, we’re in a moment of time in the speed that it’s happening, especially with the current administration. We’re liberalizing a lot of the rules for private market access. You know, there’s a lot of work being done around can retail investors access private equity firms? Private credit firms. I think that will continue to happen and I think that’s a big tailwind for, for Carta. And I think the, the, the US economy and and GDP because so much of this capital is being now deployed in, in useful ways. I think that will continue to be true in the next administration. Hopefully they will continue that legislative policy. I think it will, it will be weird in 20 or 30 years, it will be weird that we locked out 99% of Americans out of private capital. 00:42:14 [Speaker Changed] So when I look at who’s being aggressive in terms of moving from, how do we get more people onto the alternatives and private side, it’s everyone from Blackstone to BlackRock, Carlisle, Apollo, Goldman Sachs go down the list. I’m assuming you’re working with some or most of these companies. 00:42:33 [Speaker Changed] We we know them all and we’re we’re huge fans. I I was lucky enough to spend an hour with Rob Goldstein, the, the COO over at BlackRock and, and he was telling me kind of the vision of, of BlackRock and their, their perspective on private markets and you know, he, he made this very salient point, which was, you know, when they talk to their customers, they, they might look at a customer and they, they spend, you know, $25 million a year on public market infrastructure and technology for their public market asset allocation software. And they might spend, you know, 300, you know, $350,000 on their private market stuff. A fraction, a fraction, right? With BlackRock. But they might spend a million dollars total. So 350 k is with BlackRock and 700 K is with a bunch of other vendors. And his team is like, oh, we should go after that 700 k and we’ll win the whole, you know, million dollars that they send in alts. And he goes, no, no, no, no. What we need to do is figure out how to get that million dollars a year they spend in alts to be $25 million a year. Right. And then we’ll capture half of that. And, and that was the, the mental mind shift that I think BlackRock is so smart at, which is we’re trying to grow the market, not not our percentage of the market. Right. 00:43:50 [Speaker Changed] That makes, that makes a whole lot of sense. So they’re looking at an adjacent market to their public market dominance. They’re the biggest investment firm in the world at around $12 trillion. How do you decide what adjacent markets are attractive? And you might wanna enter them if you started with cap tables, you’re doing all sorts of other data analytics. How do you figure out what’s adjacent? 00:44:15 [Speaker Changed] We, we have a really strict framework on it because we spend a lot of our time thinking about where we can expand. And we have really two, two criteria. So one is do we have a a right to win? So what gives us competitive edge that we can do that nobody else can do? And second is, can we, can we win that market quickly? Because we’re very much a software business. Like if, if you can win a market, but it takes a long time. We’re a growth growth company, so it’s gotta be fast. So you have to have a very aggressive customer acquisition model that, that creates a flywheel. That the more customers you get, the more customers you get. And so if those two things are true, we’ll we’ll go after it. And it it, it leads you to really funny things where you wouldn’t actually attack adjacent markets that are obvious adja that have obvious adjacencies. So the example I love is cap tables and four nine A cap tables was a legal service when we entered it done by lawyers. Four nine a valuations was a valuation service done by valuation providers. Nobody thought of them as similar. What we realized is by having the cap table, we could do valuations faster, cheaper, smarter. And so we just started doing valuations. Well, 00:45:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, the tomba number of shareholders, you know what the last transaction or funding was. It sounds pretty basic math, right? 00:45:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. It’s just math on the cap table. But they’re a completely different industry. So if you think about from a market perspective, they’re different. But you think about it from where we have competitive edge, they’re the same and the same with fund accounting, fund administration, fund accounting software. Very different industry than cap table management. But we’re able to connect the cap tables to the funds and that gave us unique competitive advantage that nobody else could do. And so now we’re in the fund admin business and that’s, that’s our our second biggest business line. 00:45:54 [Speaker Changed] You, you guys also do compensation analytics. How did you find your way into that space? 00:45:58 [Speaker Changed] We realized we’re the only ones that could do benchmarking for both salary and equity for startups. Oh, of course. Nobody else can do it. And so Right. 00:46:06 [Speaker Changed] Without the equity, the salary may not be that significant. 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. But to, to have start at a priority and go, we’re gonna do cap tables and that’s gonna lead us into compensation didn’t make a ton of sense. And that’s the, we have a a a a flywheel of this is how we entered these industries. 00:46:21 [Speaker Changed] You are the perfect person to ask this question. I’m gonna go off script. So I spoke at an event in June in Silicon Valley. It was a kind of funky hotel that was turned into this really interesting space right on the edge of trying to remember exactly where it was about 45 minutes outside of San Francisco. But anyway, it was an employee benefits conference with all sorts of people. And I was there to talk about my book at the time. And I heard over and over again from all these people who, the 401k people, they’re employee compensation consultants, they’re health benefit consultants, all these people who were telling me that there’s this sort of misalignment amongst Silicon Valley employees who were more interested in the dollars than they are in the equity. Which just completely sounds upside down to me. Am I just looking at a weird corner of the world or is that a thing that, hey, you can’t pay your rent with equity. I have to at least make x What do you see out there in terms of how startup employees are thinking about equity versus cash payments for comp? Yeah, 00:47:40 [Speaker Changed] We, we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this and I’ll, I’ll I’ll frame it. As you know, wealth management financial advice is a well established industry in the public world and the, I’ll call it the liquid world, right? You pay, you know, 1% or half a percent of a UM to your financial advisor and they, they help you manage your assets. There is no equivalent in the private world. Like if I’m a employee and I make, you know, $150,000 a year in cash, but I’m sitting on a million or $2 million of equity, illiquid equity, how, how do I think about that? How, how do I work on it? And there is no industry for that. The financial advisors don’t know how to work with that in part ’cause they don’t understand the, the private market, you know, illiquid asset piece. But also they don’t have, they don’t have any way to monetize $2 million worth of private stock. 00:48:29 You can’t, you know, you can’t charge one basis point or a percent of a UM on it. And so, so we’ve wrestled with this question of if an industry were to be created, not wealth managed but but wealth management for illiquid people for high net worth, but illiquid asset holders, what would that industry look like? And so we’ve been thinking a lot about that problem. And, and we, we recently launched a partnership with Morgan Stanley where we’re last year we posed this problem to them and we said, Hey, we think it’s worth solving wealth management for illiquid holders. How would we do that? And they’re, you know, the largest wealth management firm in the country. They do this extremely well. And now we’re creating a motion to basically help these employees who are like, I would just want the cash ’cause I don’t know what to do with this equity. I don’t know, I don’t understand it. I I don’t know when it’s gonna be liquid. And can you create a financial advisory industry to help those people? 00:49:26 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That, that’s really fascinating. I was genuinely shocked. Maybe because I’m, I’m more risk seeking than risk averse and the thought of equity is so, you know, attractive to me. But I guess when you’re in the thick of it and you’re grinding a hundred hour weeks, hey, I’m working my butt off and I still have to worry about paying my rent. I I don’t wanna go that way. That was the only explanation I could come up with. But it was, it was really quite fascinating. I only have you for a limited amount of time. Why don’t we jump to some of our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests starting with, and you’re a good person to ask this. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:50:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, I don’t think I’ve had just one. I I think I pulled together a lot of people that have that helped me with little different things. And so, you know, everything from my boxing coach in high school and college that, that, you know, boxing’s an interesting sport ’cause it’s one of the very few sports that if you’re tired and you’re in pain and you have to let off the gas a little bit, it hurts more, not less. And 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] You gotta dig 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] Deep. That’s right. And you know, there’s, it’s literally in the corner and you know, from, from perseverance from him, from the marines, from, you know, mark Andreessen who helped me figure out, you know, NetSuite, what we call ERP for private capital at a breakfast to, you know, John Waldron, who I had to got to have a lunch with him, who’s the president at, at Goldman, who explained to me why bankers make more money than I do. And it’s ’cause of the regulatory defensibility. And so you just pick up these nuggets from these very smart people and, and you, you hold ’em as a treasure trove. 00:51:11 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? Are you reading anything currently? 00:51:15 [Speaker Changed] We just read Amp It Up as a, as a leadership team. So we, last month we, we took 60 of our top leaders at Carta and, and on an offsite. And every time we do an offsite at Carta, we pick a book to read and everybody has to read it. And we do a discussion group. And it was very timely for us. We’re, we’re in very much an acceleration mo motion and so, so everybody at, at Carta right now is, is reading Amp It up and, and talking about it. 00:51:41 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. What about streaming? What are you listening to in terms of podcasts or watching on Netflix or Amazon? I kind of get the sense you’re not a big couch potato kind of guy. 00:51:51 [Speaker Changed] I’m not, I I don’t really watch TV except I have an 11-year-old boy and I recently got him into Arrested Development, which is a classic, classic. I absolutely mean it’s some of the best comedy ever done. And, and we’re watching it together and we’re loving it. And now he, he hits me with the lines and you know, dad, I, I’ve made a huge mistake and we’re having a great time with it 00:52:14 [Speaker Changed] Narrator. It wasn’t, yeah, right. That’s, I mean, that’s where that comes from. People use it all the time, but it all goes right back to, I, I like his podcast, smartless is always kind of fun. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in fill in the blank entrepreneurship, startups, private companies? 00:52:41 [Speaker Changed] You know, I, I just did a talk at Waterloo yesterday to a bunch of soon to be grads there and, and I, I said, you know, they were computer science grads and, and I said, you know, there’s, you know, they know of this algorithm called the Hill climbing algorithm, which is basically, if you’re trying to find a global maximum versus a local maximum. What I mean by that, the analogy I use is, let’s say you’re an a French, you know, you’re climbing in the French Alps as a mountain climber and you’re trying to find the tallest mountain in the French Alps, but there’s cloud cover. You can’t see, you can’t see the tops of these. How would you find the, the highest mountain? And you would, you would do it by picking a mountain, climbing to the top, recording how high you are, and then randomly jumping to another mountain and climbing and recording that. 00:53:22 And there’s all this math around, you know, how many random jumps to mountains do. You have to have to have a 90% probability of finding the global, the global maximum. And I, I say it’s a great analogy for a metaphor for, for early careers, which is most of us unfortunately are taught. You go through kindergarten to high school to college, you pick a career at 19 or a specialty, you then become a, a finance analyst, an associate, then you become a senior associate, then you become a man and you just, you kind of walk this track and you, you never ask the question, am I on a local opt hill or a global optimal hill? And I encourage people early to, to jump mountains to figure out which, which mountain they want to be on. And I think one of the reasons many people my age are very unhappy in their careers is they look back and they realize, oh, I got to the top of the mountain, but it was the wrong mountain. And I encourage young people to, to mountain jump. 00:54:17 [Speaker Changed] I, I, I love that metaphor. Mountain jump is a great, great line. What do you know about the world of entrepreneurship, startups, et cetera today might have been useful 20 or so years ago when you were first starting out? 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] Idea matters. It matters a lot. ’cause I’ve had a lot of great ideas that did not work and I worked hard, hard at it. I also think there’s this counterintuitive, I guess, thesis that’s happening right now, which is the more entrepreneurs there are, the harder entrepreneurship gets. But people think the opposite, right? Oh, so many’s do, so many people are doing it. I can do too. The number Michael 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] MOBAs not calls that the paradox of skill, the more skillful players there are in sports, the more luck matters because everybody’s playing at such a high level. 00:55:08 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. And I think it’s one of these funny things where like, not many people, you know, dream or move to Atlanta to be a hundred meter, you know, sprinter. ’cause I, you know, I think I can be the greatest a hundred meter sprinter in the world. And it’s because there’s not a lot of luck. I mean, there’s luck around, you don’t get injured and all of those things, but like, we pretty quickly can tell who’s good and who’s not good. That’s 00:55:32 [Speaker Changed] Your skill outcome. 00:55:33 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and the, it’s a little bit like acting like so much of it is luck that because so much of it is luck. People think anybody can do it and it, it’s actually worse. You actually have to be a super skilled, you know, a hundred meter sprinter and you have to be lucky to do one of these startups. And I think a lot of people are like, oh, you know, a lot of it’s luck. So if it’s luck, anybody can do it. It’s, it’s, you gotta have both. It makes it actually harder, not easier. 00:55:59 [Speaker Changed] I love the expression, table stakes. Smart, hardworking, that’s just to enter the arena. Then you gotta luck. Get lucky on top of it. That’s right. Un unbelievable. Henry, this has been absolutely fascinating. We have been speaking with Henry Ward. He is the CEO and co-founder of Carta, helping to manage much more than just the cap table for tens of thousands of companies, investment funds and investors.

Title: Adobe Stock Pricing Powerhouse Now 38% Cheaper, Buy?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/21/adobe-stock-pricing-powerhouse-now-38-cheaper-buy/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. Here are some details. While revenue growth is beneficial, this is not solely a growth viewpoint. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, decreasing risk and facilitating reinvestment of capital. The market typically rewards this. To provide some context, Adobe delivers diversified software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, serving enterprise clients within the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. *LTM: Last Twelve Months But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe still possesses an advantage that remains robust. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is considerable merit in a more diversified approach. If you're aiming for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has exceeded its benchmark, which is a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns greater than 105% since inception. Effective risk management is essential; consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio might be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics. Here is our criterion for selection: We evaluate stocks valued at over $10 Billion in market cap, filtering out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also only consider stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year. Below are statistics for stocks with this selection methodology applied since 12/31/2016. That being said, Adobe has experienced some significant declines in challenging periods. It fell approximately 72.5% during the Dot-Com bubble and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the drop was around 60%. Even during less severe downturns, such as in 2018 and the Covid pandemic, it still saw roughly a 25% decrease in value. Therefore, despite everything working in its favor, Adobe is not immune when market conditions worsen. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to review how the stock has bounced back from notable dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks generate superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

This page gives you the inside edge—live updates on trending meme coins, alpha from crypto degens, and whispers from FOMO-driven trading circles. If you’re hunting for the next 10x or 100x gem, you’re in the right place. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest insider insights on the best meme coins, so keep refreshing! October 21, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s resilience, following the October 10 market crash, which wiped out $19B in leveraged positions and more than $450B in market cap, hints at a coming bull run. According to analysts at TD Cowen, Bitcoin could reach $141K by December if the asset regains its lost momentum. Following the brutal market crash, Bitcoin lost 10% in a matter of hours and dipped below $105K over the course of a week. A $141K prediction is more than feasible given Bitcoin’s resilience to such a devastating hit, and thanks to Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale, currently at $24.4M. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Solution, Hyper aims to enhance the Bitcoin network by making it faster, cheaper, more performant, and more scalable, thereby accommodating institutional investors who require high throughput and near-instant finality. Learn how to buy $HYPER right here. October 21, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Global investment management firm VanEck recently filed an application with the SEC for an ETF that tracks the price of Lido Staked $ETH ($stETH). If approved, it would be the first of its kind in the US. The firm also stated in a blog post that its ETF would give institutional investors ‘a compliant, tax-efficient way to gain Ethereum staking exposure within a regulated investment structure.’ While ETFs, such as those proposed by VanEck, offer investors a way to profit from crypto without owning the asset directly, others prefer to hold their investment directly. These investors, however, understand the challenge of finding promising assets to buy, especially if they’re in the market for the best meme coins. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in with its proposed Snorter Bot. When launched, it’ll be a Telegram-based crypto trading bot that facilitates features such as sniping, copying trades, and managing wallets. Find out more about Snorter Token here. October 21, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion continued with its Ethereum ($ETH) buying spree as the second-largest crypto’s price slid over the past few days. The world’s top Ethereum corporate treasury bought an additional 203,826 $ETH yesterday, which brought its total holdings to 3,236,014 $ETH. Lee said in a statement yesterday that with the expected Ethereum Supercycle, the currently low price of the coin represents an attractive risk/reward.’ Like Lee, other crypto traders are looking for alternative digital assets that are promising yet reasonably priced, such as Maxi Doge ($MAXI). The project aims to position $MAXI as one of the market’s best meme coins and dethrone its distant cousin Doge. To date, the $MAXI presale has raised over $3.7M, as it continues to attract fellow degens to the fold. Get the full details in ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ October 21, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate to hold Bitcoin, recently purchased 168 $BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The recent purchase brings up strategy’s total $BTC holdings to 640,418 (worth $71B), with an overall average purchase price of $74,010. $BTC prices have been on a rollercoaster since the market crash on October 10th. The OG crypto rebounded to $111K on Monday after falling to as low as $103,500, helping MSTR shares climb by 3% in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. While institutional giants like Strategy continue to expand their $BTC reserves, retail investors remain cautious amid market volatility, redirecting capital toward promising presale opportunities with strong upside potential. One such rising contender is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Layer-2 scalability solution that employs Solana Virtual Machine to bring lightning-fast transactions and cross-chain operability to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. Check out our expert $HYPER price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:47 UTC Binance founder Changpeng Zhao believes that the crypto captain has what it takes to flip gold’s market cap, although it might take some time. Currently, gold is the world’s largest asset, but that is likely to change soon, as the $BTC price soars over the coming cycles. Currently ranked eighth, $BTC has a market cap of $2.2T. CZ’s post also serves as a reminder that the long-term crypto projection looks strong, despite brief corrections. This is further evident from Bitcoin Hyper’s sizzling hot presale, ready to smash through $25M. The project is building a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, bringing more speed and programmability to the network. Could $HYPER be the next meme coin to explode? Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to find out. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Elon Musk reignites meme coin manis with his new viral post ‘Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO!’ His post sent $FLOKI soaring over 20% within hours, causing the token to climb from $0.00006689 to $0.00007456. $FLOKI’s derivatives volume spiked by 663% and open interest rose by 165%, all indicating strong retail speculation surrounding the asset. $FLOKI did not soar alone; Musk’s post helped the entire meme coin market cap to rise by 5.8% to $55.2B, once again highlighting his unmatched influence on dog-themed tokens. FLOKI’s official X account declared it the ‘#1 trending token on CxoinGecko,’ branding itself as ‘Elon’s dog.’ With $FLOKI riding Musk’s viral wave, the newest contender in the block is quietly stealing the spotlight – Maxi Doge ($MAXI). A meme token built on a body-building trading doge that represents gym pumps, raw strength, and the grind of the bull market. Beyond the high-octane meme appeal, the project is already building a loyal community united by its bold ‘crush the charts’ motto. Check out our in-depth $MAXI price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock just launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange with the starting price of $11.10. As the official press release states, the goal is to expose ‘retail investors (i) with specific knowledge and/or experience of investing in similar products’ to Bitcoin and other digital assets in a regulated ecosystem. BlackRock’s IB1T is now available in 12 registered locations, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, UK, and Germany. The news is bullish for Bitcoin and could catalyze its Q4 run once $BTC breaks the $120K resistance point again. When that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may also see visible boost, although the presale is already in full bull mode. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2, promising a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Hyper already raised $24.4M in presale and it targets a Q1 2026 release date if the market is favorable.

Title: Here's What Traders Expect Intel Stock To Do After Earnings This Week
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/here-is-what-traders-expect-intel-stock-to-do-after-earnings-this-week-11833036
Time Published: 2025-10-21T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
Intel (INTC) is set to report third-quarter earnings after markets close Thursday, and traders expect the stock to be unusually volatile following the results. Intel shares are expected to move nearly 10% in either direction the day after this week’s earnings report, according to recent options prices. A jump of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put shares at about $42, their highest price since April 2024. Alternately, shares could decline 10% to end the week at just above $32. Intel shares have moved an average of 6.5% after its four most recent earnings reports. In July, the stock dropped more than 8% after it reported an unexpected loss and issued a disappointing third-quarter forecast. The last time Intel shares rose on an earnings report was this time last year, when the company touted “solid progress” on its turnaround plan. Intel's stock has surged in recent months, boosted by optimism about the federal government's stake in the chipmaker and what it means for its troubled foundry business. Expectations for a large post-earnings move likely reflect the stock's recent run-up and uncertainty about how recent investments will affect operations in the near term. Thursday’s report will be Intel’s first since the federal government took an approximately 10% stake in the company. That deal with the Trump administration may have been a turning point for the embattled chipmaker, which has since received additional investments from Japanese venture capital firm SoftBank and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), with whom Intel will partner on custom hardware. During the post-earnings conference call on Thursday, investors will be hoping for updates from executives on those investments and whether they change the outlook for Intel's struggling foundry business The deals have at least been a lifeline for Intel’s stock, which was treading water until rumors of White House negotiations began to circulate in early August. Intel shares have risen 90% since the start of the year, and all of those gains have come in the last three months. Still, analysts are on the whole skeptical that the stock can maintain its recent momentum. Five of the seven analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha have assigned Intel stock a “Hold” rating, while two suggest selling. The average price target of about $30.60 represents nearly 20% downside from Monday's closing level.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record fourth consecutive day of outflows

Time Published: 2025-10-21T08:16:05Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin ETFs post $40.5 million outflow, fourth straight day of losses. Bitcoin falls nearly 3% to $108,112 as crypto sentiment weakens. BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London amid market turbulence. US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $40.4 million in net outflows on Monday, marking their fourth straight day of negative flows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to register outflows during the session, with $100.7 million exiting the fund. The losses were partly offset by inflows into five other ETFs managed by Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Invesco. The latest outflow follows Friday’s $366.6 million and Thursday’s $536.4 million withdrawals, extending a streak of negative sentiment that has persisted across digital asset funds since last week. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded continued weakness, with $145.7 million in net outflows on Monday — their third consecutive day of redemptions. Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday, reversing its weekend rebound as cryptocurrencies lagged behind other risk assets that benefited from easing US-China trade tensions. The world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped nearly 3% to $108,112.30, struggling to maintain the $110,000 level after a volatile start to October that erased roughly $500 billion in total crypto market capitalisation. Traders cited the lingering impact of the early-October flash crash — which triggered widespread liquidations and heightened risk aversion — as a key reason for the muted recovery. Market participants appeared hesitant to re-enter positions amid ongoing volatility and renewed concerns over ETF outflows. Optimism surrounding “Uptober,” a term describing the crypto market’s historical tendency to perform strongly in October, has faded rapidly. Bitcoin is now down more than 2% for the month, underscoring the loss of bullish momentum. The broader crypto market mirrored Bitcoin’s slide, with most major altcoins trading lower. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, fell 5.3% to $3,859.65, slipping below the key $4,000 threshold. XRP declined 2.2% to $2.4145, showing little reaction to the announcement of a new treasury backed by issuer Ripple Labs. Binance’s BNB token dropped 5.7%, while Cardano and Solana shed between 4% and 6%. Among memecoins, Dogecoin fell 4.3%, and $TRUMP lost 3.1%, reflecting a broad-based retreat across the digital asset space. Amid the downturn, BlackRock announced the launch of a new Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, following the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax restrictions on crypto-based investment vehicles. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, listed on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, is structured as a Bitcoin-linked security that allows investors to purchase fractional units of Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The product is designed to closely track BTC prices while operating within a regulated investment framework. According to The Sunday Times, the entry price for the product will allow investors to buy fractions of Bitcoin for about $11 per unit, providing retail investors with exposure to the digital asset without direct ownership or the need to trade on crypto exchanges. BlackRock remains one of the most successful issuers of Bitcoin-linked products, with its US-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF holding more than $85 billion in net assets, according to SoSoValue data.

Title: $2B to flow into BlackRock’s UK Bitcoin ETF: How UK traders could recycle into IBIT

IBIT wrapper launch in the UK opens a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) began trading in the UK on Oct. 20, opening a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time as UK retail investors gain regulated access to Bitcoin (BTC) exposure. The launch capitalizes on the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent reversal of its ban on crypto-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). BlackRock’s US Bitcoin ETF, which launched two years ago and has nearly $65 billion in lifetime inflows, now offers British investors entry at approximately $11 per unit. This is a fraction of Bitcoin’s current $110,365 price. BlackRock reported $17 billion in net inflows to its digital asset products during the third quarter alone, part of $205 billion in total net inflows as the firm crossed $13 trillion in assets under management. The UK crypto market holds an estimated £13.3 billion across 7 million investors, per FCA data from March 2025. An IG report from early October projected the market could expand 20% following the FCA’s policy shift, translating to £2.4 billion to £3.2 billion in new capital, or roughly $3.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Bitcoin products have captured 60.6% of crypto investment flows globally, according to CoinShares’ latest report. Applied to UK projections, Bitcoin-focused vehicles could draw $1.93 billion to $2.6 billion. IBIT’s dominance in the US market, where it commands 75.5% of all Bitcoin ETF inflows since launch, suggests the fund could secure $1.5 billion to $2 billion from British investors. The fund’s structure removes traditional barriers that kept mainstream investors on the sidelines. Rather than navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, or purchasing entire coins, investors buy regulated shares through familiar brokerage accounts. The low entry threshold, roughly $11 per unit, democratizes access to an asset that trades above $100,000. BlackRock’s survey data supports aggressive growth projections. The firm expects a 21$ increase in UK adults investing in crypto for the first time over the next 12 months, with Britain ranking third in European crypto investment growth. The company predicts 4 million Bitcoin investors in the UK by year-end. Interest concentrates among younger demographics. IG’s research found 50% of 18-24-year-olds and 49% of 25-34-year-olds would consider investing in crypto via exchange-traded notes. Additionally, 32%of prospective investors cite regulatory oversight and safety as primary motivations, while 19% value the ability to hold crypto within tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts and Self-Invested Personal Pensions. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, with 95% already mined, creates scarcity dynamics that amplify demand pressures. BTC’s price grew 120% last year, and is up by nearly 20% in 2025, driven partly by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance following his return to the White House. The UK government outlined plans last month for a comprehensive crypto-asset regulatory regime overseen by the FCA, positioning Britain to compete with jurisdictions that moved faster on digital asset frameworks. BlackRock’s launch transforms that regulatory shift into accessible products for millions of retail investors who previously faced exclusion or complexity barriers.

Title: Ethereum Whale BitMine Buys 203,800 ETH – Now Holds 2.7% Of Circulating Supply
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-whale-bitmine-203800-eth-2-7-supply/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T07:00:44Z

Ethereum (ETH) treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies today announced that it had bought another 203,800 ETH last week. Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by market share, has no immediate plans to increase mobile phone tariffs, belying market expectations, choosing instead to grow revenue by driving users to consume more data. Jio and its closest rival Bharti Airtel Ltd recently removed their entry-level plans to bump up their average revenue per user (or Arpu, a key performance metric for telecom operators), triggering expectations that the telecom operators would increase tariffs towards the end of the year or in early 2026. “We are nudging consumers to consume more and happily pay more, but no immediate plans for the tariff (hike)," said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm, during an earnings call with analysts. In the September quarter, Jio’s monthly average revenue per user rose 1.2% to ₹211.4 from ₹208.8 at the end of June, with growth slowing due to promotional 5G offers, according to the company. Following Jio’s decision to remove its entry-level pack, analysts had expected it to both raise tariffs and focus on premium services to close the gap with Bharti Airtel, which leads the industry in terms of Arpu ( ₹250 at the end of June). Airtel is yet to declare its September-quarter earnings. “If Reliance were not to increase tariffs in the next few months, its [year-on-year] Arpu growth for the March quarter would likely be 4% (at say ₹214/subscriber)," J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note dated 19 October. “Investors continue to expect Jio to raise telecom tariffs ahead of the proposed IPO of Reliance Jio (likely by June 2026)." Jio net added 8.3 million mobile subscribers during the September quarter, taking its subscriber base to 506.4 million. At the end of September, Jio had 234 million 5G subscribers, up from 213 million in the preceding June quarter. 5G now accounts for 50% of Jio’s total wireless traffic. Leading tariff hikesWhen telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike. But while Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd have been vocal about the need to hike tariffs to increase the return on capital employed (RoCE, a measure of profitability and efficiency), Jio has refrained from openly talking about increasing tariffs. “We (the industry) are operating with the lowest Arpus and the lowest rate per gigabyte. Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October.

It added more than 1 million new homes each month during the July-September quarter, taking its total fixed broadband connections to 23 million. Jio has set a target of 100 million home broadband customers, with no specified timeline. “The rate for connecting new homes has been increasing and the technology is working well," Thakur told analysts during the call. “A lot of these new connections are being done wirelessly, and therefore the implementation itself is simpler, faster, and we are expecting that we will be able to scale this up quite significantly from where we are today." Jio is leveraging its unlicensed band radio technology—the 5G Air Fibre and fiber route—to provide home broadband internet.

On the role of Jio’s parent, Jio Platforms Ltd, in this arrangement, Thakur said, “Jio is going to develop its own products and it is going to work with Reliance Intelligence to bring its solutions to the market." Jio Platforms houses the telecom and digital services business of Reliance Industries. Reliance Jio Infocomm is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms, accounting for most of its business. Reliance Intelligence will develop and invest in creating AI products, Thakur explained, adding that this would require a lot of infrastructure and computing needs such as graphic processing units (GPUs).

While Jio will have an open slate to work with companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Google, Reliance Intelligence will compete with these global tech giants, he said. “This dual structure—RI (Reliance Intelligence) developing core AI capabilities and Jio leveraging them across its platforms—ensures lower incremental investment needs, stronger integration, and long-term cost efficiency, positioning Reliance to monetize enterprise AI workloads and India- specific digital services in the coming years," the Antique Stock Broking analysts said in their note. Jio Platforms reported a 12.8% year-on-year growth in net profit to ₹7,375 crore for the September quarter. Revenue from operations rose 14.6% to ₹36,332 crore.

Title: Anthropic Expands Claude Code to Web and iOS for Cloud Coding
URL: https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2025/10/20/anthropic-expands-claude-code-to-web-and-ios-for-cloud-coding/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:55:04Z
Full Content:
AI startup Anthropic is bringing its AI coding assistant Claude Code to the web and iOS, giving developers a way to run coding jobs straight from their browser or phone. The new tool, now in beta, lets users offload tasks like bug fixes, backend tweaks, or documentation updates—all handled in the cloud. Developers can connect GitHub repositories, describe what they need, and watch as Claude codes in real time inside a secure, isolated sandbox. Each task runs independently with live progress updates, and multiple jobs can run in parallel across different projects. When done, Claude automatically generates pull requests and change summaries. The iOS version offers a mobile-friendly way to steer code sessions on the go, though Anthropic says it’s an early preview meant for testing and feedback. Security-wise, all sessions are locked down in sandboxed environments with strict network limits. Git actions go through a secure proxy to ensure Claude only touches approved repositories. Developers can even whitelist domains—for example, to allow package downloads for testing. With this release, Anthropic is clearly signaling it wants Claude Code to become more than a chat-based helper—it’s positioning it as a full-fledged AI pair programmer in the cloud, available anywhere you work. Check out the promo video below: Anthropic has raised billions in funding, with its most recent $13 billion US Series F round in September 2025—valuing it at whopping $183 billion US—led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Key earlier backers include $4 billion from Amazon in 2023 and $2 billion from Google, alongside investors like Bessemer Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst, Cisco Investments, and over 80 others such as BlackRock.

BlackRock’s latest move brings regulated Bitcoin exposure to UK investors for the first time. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) opened strong on the LSE. BlackRock’s IB1T launched on the London Stock Exchange, giving UK retail investors direct access to Bitcoin. The launch follows the FCA’s policy shift, allowing retail access to crypto-linked products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETP [IB1T] is now live on the London Stock Exchange [LSE]. This marks a key milestone for retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin in the UK. The move signals both a policy shift from British regulators and BlackRock’s growing dominance in the digital-asset investment space. According to data from BlackRock’s official listing page, IB1T opened trading on 20 October 2025 at $11.10, climbing 5.54% on its first day. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is physically backed by Bitcoin. It offers investors direct exposure to the asset’s spot price without needing to hold or custody BTC themselves. BlackRock said the product carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.15% per annum until 31 December 2025, after which it will rise to 0.25%. The firm confirmed the ETP complies with UK regulatory requirements and maintains its reserves through regulated custodians. The launch follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax rules that had previously blocked retail participation in crypto-linked products. By approving products like IB1T, the UK is signaling a more pragmatic approach toward digital-asset investment. This aligns it with the U.S. and European markets that already allow similar instruments. The move also comes as Bitcoin trades around $110,000, recovering from recent volatility that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The renewed institutional inflows from newly launched products could help stabilize BTC’s trajectory and re-anchor market confidence. BlackRock’s debut places it among a growing list of European Bitcoin ETP issuers, including WisdomTree, 21Shares, and CoinShares, all of which operate similar products across Germany, Switzerland, and France. Traditional financial heavyweights are now competing head-to-head in Europe’s maturing digital-asset market, where regulation is fast becoming a competitive advantage. The new listing adds to BlackRock’s expanding digital-asset portfolio. Its portfolio includes a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, an Ethereum ETP, and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). With the UK now opening the door to mainstream crypto investing, BlackRock’s move shows the growing convergence between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP could become a benchmark product for retail Bitcoin exposure in one of the world’s oldest and most influential financial centers.

Title: This Wall Street Firm Says Alphabet Stock Is A Better Bet Than Meta. Here's Why.

Time Published: 2025-10-20T17:01:40Z
Full Content:
You don't necessarily have to choose between the stocks of two Big Tech giants—but if you must, Oppenheimer has a pick for you. Shares of both Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram, have been strong performers this year, outpacing the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) and the S&P 500. Still, Oppenheimer's analysts prefer the former's shares to the latter's. On Sunday, they put a $300 price tag on Alphabet, about 18% above Friday's close and the highest on Wall Street, and an $825 target on Meta, 15% higher than last week's finish and below Visible Alpha's analyst average. The Oppenheimer analysts cited what they considered "more conservative" Street estimates on Alphabet, along with a lower valuation on the shares. While the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks has outpaced the S&P 500 this year, under the hood there are signs that it might make sense to pick and choose carefully among them. One example: Three of the stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 this year. "While we are positive on the long-term benefits from Meta's push into AI and proven ability to outgrow peers," they wrote, "we are more bullish on [Alphabet] near term, given more conservative estimates and lower valuation." While the Magnificent 7 is running ahead of the S&P 500 this year, it's not surprising that investors might be looking to pick and choose among the group these days: Three of the seven stocks have underperformed the benchmark index year-to-date. More stocks outside the group are lifting the index than in recent years, Capital Group wrote last week, a reference to what's known as market breadth, marking "a healthy move away from the extreme concentration that raised concerns about risks to investor portfolios." "Rising valuations among companies in the index and more clarity on tariffs and interest rate cuts could help lift the U.S. equities market, which has trailed those in Europe and elsewhere," Capital Group wrote.

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A bright young intern just left my firm to work for a New York hedge fund. That was bad news for me, but not unusual in the financial world. Hedge funds are magnets for talent, partly because in good years they can pay handsome bonus checks. Gurufocus.com maintains a screen of stocks popular with hedge funds. A year ago, I selected five of these stocks to recommend. They have risen 23.6%, leaving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index in the dust at 15.3%. Frankly 15.3% is a fine year. But 23.6% is better, so let’s play this game again. Here are five hedge fund favorites that appeal to me now. Every major semiconductor company that I know of, with the exception of Intel Corp. (INTC), uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) to make its chips. TSM has expertise, precision and economies of scale. It also has a net profit margin of 42%, astoundingly high. Yet because Taiwan lives under a sword of Damocles – the threat of Chinese invasion – the stock is not horribly expensive. It sells for 30 times recent earnings, and 26 times the earnings analysts expect in 2026. Al Gore, U.S. vice president under President Clinton, is one of many investment managers who own it. He is the co-founder of Generation Investment Management, based in London. Warren Buffett, the legendary CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), one described hedge funds as a compensation scheme disguised as an asset class. That hasn’t stopped hedge funds from investing in Berkshire. Buffett will step down as chief executive at the end of this year. But I think highly of the team that will succeed him, beginning with Greg Abel as the next CEO. Berkshire’s debt-to-equity ratio is a nice low 19%. If the U.S. economy happens to get into trouble, Berkshire could rescue other companies on favorable terms, as it did in the past with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. I’m on record as having predicted that the U.S. will be in recession by May 2026. Could I be wrong? Sure. But I see auto loan defaults rising, along with credit-card delinquencies. I see hiring petering out. And I think that tariffs and deportations are counterproductive for the economy. One firm that usually holds up well during economic downturns is Walmart Inc. (WMT). It is famous for its low prices. During recessions it can hold onto most of its previous customers, and get new ones who are trading down. Regrettably, at $107 a share, the stock’s valuation ratios are high. I would nibble if it falls below $100 and buy with enthusiasm at $90. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) chairman Jamie Dimon remarked this month that soured bank loans are like “cockroaches.” You rarely see just one. JPMorgan Chase has been pretty successful in avoiding bad loans, although it did suffer some notoriety from its relationship with sex offender Jeffey Epstein. One thing I look for in a bank stock is a return on assets of 1.00% or more. JPMorgan Chase has done that in six of the past seven years, and seems certain to do so again this year. If the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates, but rates on longer-term loans such as mortgages stay close to where they are now, it would be a Goldilocks scenario for JPMorgan. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), which makes bulldozers and other construction equipment, is looking at good news and bad news. The good news is that the dollar is weak, which helps the company export. More than half its sales usually come from outside the U.S. The bad news is that the Trump administration is slapping a lot of tariffs on imports, inviting retaliation. My guess is that the dollar effects will outweigh the tariff effects. The good performance of the hedge-fund favorites I recommended a year ago was sparked by H&E Equipment Services Inc., which sold itself to Herc Holdings Inc. (HRI) in June at a 68% gain. Customers Bancorp. Inc. (CUBI) also did well, returning 29%. On the flip side, D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) stumbled to a 14% loss as homebuilding languished. In between those extremes, Loews Corp. (L) achieved a 22% return, and Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) notched 13%. Figures are total returns including dividends, from October 28, 2024 through October 16, 2025. Note that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: Personally, and for most of my clients, I own Taiwan Semiconductor, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase.

Title: Trump is attracting investment to the US – but at a huge cost to workers and the environment

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.5shr7e5jm Share article Print article Early in his second presidency, Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs was met with widespread scepticism. Critics warned of economic decline and a global backlash. Yet the current landscape for the United States paints a more complex picture. Less than a year into his second term in office, the White House claims that Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US. It also proclaims that Trump has secured trillions of dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2025 alone. Other voices, however, estimate that these commitments will amount to just a fraction of that. So what’s the true picture? Much of this FDI is going into the US’s burgeoning semiconductor sector. This inward investment is indeed a stark reversal from the post-1991 trend of outbound American capital, when US firms raced to set up factories in countries where it was cheaper to manufacture. And the surge is bolstered by commitments of US$300 billion (£225 billion) in capital investment commitments from tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta. These investments reflect both Trump’s aggressive diplomacy and his close relationship with Silicon Valley’s tech elite. Despite concerns about a tech bubble, these investments signal a deepening state-private partnership, and a reorientation of priorities with a view to coming out on top in the global AI race. Central to this strategy is the reshaping of global supply chains. At a conference of venture capitalists in March, US vice-president J.D. Vance criticised US firms for their reliance on cheap overseas labour. He warned of the risks of losing the US’s technological advantage, especially to China. The solution, Vance and Trump argue, is to bring investments and jobs back home. But does this logic – backed by massive domestic and foreign investment – translate into the kind of reshoring (when operations that were previously moved abroad transfer back to the country) that delivers good jobs? In our new book Capitalist Value Chains, Christin Bernhold and I argue that global supply chains have made labour exploitation and environmental degradation worse. Efforts by both former president Joe Biden and Trump to contain China’s rise reflect not a retreat from globalisation, but a strategic reconfiguration of supply chains. In the early days of globalisation, American administrations supported China’s rise as the workshop of the world and an exporter of low-cost consumer goods to the US. But over the last 15 years, the US has increased efforts to contain China’s technological rise, while continuing to rely on its cheap imports. Trump’s tariffs on China represent a step change. The US’s strategy now seems to have shifted from slowing China’s advance to attempts to inflict severe economic damage on the Chinese economy in order to reduce it to a subordinate, rather than rival, trading partner. So will these investments create quality employment? And what are the environmental consequences? The likely answers are probably not, and probably terrible. Reshoring doesn’t mean abandoning global supply chains. Recently, Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on China in response to its restrictions on rare earth exports. Western industries – especially automotive and defence – warned that this escalation could break supply chains. US chip-dependent sectors such as electronics, defence and telecoms still rely heavily on Chinese rare earths. Even if the US succeeds in reshaping supply chains, it doesn’t guarantee the creation of good jobs. Despite Trump’s pro-labour rhetoric, his administration’s actions tell a different story. In March 2025, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency laid off 216,000 federal workers. Collective bargaining rights were stripped from 400,000 employees across agencies like Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. The White House also revoked the US$15 per hour minimum wage requirement for publicly-funded businesses. Traditional sectors are suffering. Since April, machinery giant John Deere has cut more than 2,000 jobs, citing cost increases blamed on Trump’s tariffs. The big three carmakers – Ford, GM and Stellantis – claim that tariffs will cost them US$7 billion in lost earnings in 2025, with severe consequences for pay and jobs. Will the tech sector’s massive capital spends offset these losses? Most of the US$300 billion pledged by firms like Apple and Amazon is earmarked for AI infrastructure: high-powered data centres, custom chips, graphics processing units and cloud networks. These are capital-intensive projects that generate short-term construction jobs but offer little in the way of long-term employment. Simultaneously, tech companies are downsizing as they substitute AI for human labour. Microsoft announced layoffs of 6,000 and 9,000 employees from its 228,000-strong global labour force in May and July 2025, including 800 in Washington, Microsoft’s home state. And what about the quality of the remaining jobs? At Amazon, for example, the company’s software engineers have described how it is using AI to cut jobs and speed up work. According to reports, tasks that previously took weeks are now expected to be completed in days. One engineer told journalists that his team was halved in size, but is expected to produce the same amount of code, using AI tools. The environmental costs of AI are mounting. Researchers have found that data centres already consume 4.4% of the US’s electricity. By 2028, AI could require as much power as 22% of American households use annually. This surge in demand, combined with federal budget cuts to green energy initiatives, is diverting renewable energy away from broader decarbonisation efforts such as hydrogen tech projects, battery plants and upgrades to the electric grid. These figures are only set to rise if the surge continues. According to the International Energy Agency, fossil fuels – particularly coal and natural gas – are expected to supply more than 40% of the additional electricity needed by data centres until 2030. Trump’s push towards AI, coupled with his tariff regime and alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite, may reshape the economy and global supply chains – but not in favour of workers or the planet. The promise of revitalised manufacturing and job creation masks deeper risks: automation, weakened labour protections and escalating environmental harm.

Title: Stocks Poised For More Gains As Shutdown Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rose Friday and notched gains last week as the government shutdown continues. The shutdown is now the third-longest in U.S. history. The record is 35 days from Donald Trump’s first presidential term. There was also a 21-day shutdown under President Bill Clinton. Last week, the large-cap S&P 500 index rose 1.7%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, was up 1.6%. Health care subsidies are central to the standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats want Affordable Care Act subsidies to continue, and Republicans have refused to negotiate. Meanwhile, federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, which was originally scheduled for electronic deposit on Oct. 24. Key government data releases, including the monthly jobs report, are also delayed due to the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the September 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Oct. 24, but no other reports will be produced until the government reopens. The inflation report will be instrumental to the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on Oct. 28 and 29. The Fed last met on Sept. 16 and 17, when the committee reduced the federal funds rate by a quarter-point and acknowledged the dual risks of inflation and unemployment. If the September CPI shows higher-than-expected prices, the Fed’s job of stimulating jobs gets more complicated. Lower interest rates can support higher employment but can also fuel price increases. CME FedWatch currently shows a 96.7% probability that rates will decline again in October, down from 98.7% on Friday. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 are up 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.4%, and Dow Jones futures have gained 0.2%. Netflix (NFLX), Coca-Cola (KO) and General Motors (GM) will report third quarter earnings on Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) are on the calendar for Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) and Ford (F) report Thursday.

Stock futures are rising this morning as investors await a slew of earnings reports, key inflation data and updates on trade negotiations in the coming days; Amazon Web Services experienced disruptions that created service issues for several major websites; Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the prior model in the U.S. and China during its first ten days on the market; proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to reject a proposed pay package for CEO Elon Musk; and Cooper Companies (COO) stock is rising on news activist investor Jana had built a stake in the medical device maker. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are gaining ground at the start of of a busy week for corporate earnings, after major indexes rose last week despite a volatile stretch of trading fueled by banking sector worries and trade-related tensions. Investors are awaiting further developments on the trade front and awaiting the scheduled release on Wednesday of inflation data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focussed Nasdaq added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold futures were up nearly 2% at $4,295 an ounce, rebounding from a downturn on Friday that followed a string of record highs. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading near $111,000, after dropping below $104,000 on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, held steady at 4.01%. Several major websites went down after cloud platform Amazon Web Services experienced major outages early Monday. The outage affected several Amazon (AMZN) services, including Alexa, while also reportedly creating disruptions for Disney+, Lyft, the New York Times, Reddit, Ring, Snapchat, Reddit, Ring, Robinhood, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Venmo, Verizon, gaming site Fortnite, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Epic Games Store, AI model Perplexity and the McDonalds app. Shares of Amazon were little-changed in premarket trading. The shares have lost 3% since the start of the year, making Amazon the only member of the Magnificent 7 group of major technology stocks to be in negative territory in 2025. Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% during the first ten days of sales in the U.S. and China, the two markets that make up the bulk of the company’s phone sales, according to Counterpoint Research. The report said that improvements to the iPhone 17 provided value that helped draw in more buyers. “A better chip, improved display, higher base storage, selfie camera upgrade – all for the same price as last year’s iPhone 16,” said senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang. The report found that the base model iPhone 17 performed well in China, while the premium iPhone 17 Max saw strong demand in the U.S., with discounts provided by phone carriers helping to spur sales. Apple shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Proxy voting service Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is advising Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to vote against a proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The proxy firm wrote that it was concerned about the magnitude and structure of the pay package, which features several lofty benchmarks that include pushing the company’s value to more than $8.5 trillion, well above its current market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion. ISS also advised shareholders to reject a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk’s xAI, the AI company that merged with Musk’s X social media platform earlier this month. Tesla shares, which have gained 33% over the past three months, were up about 1% ahead of the opening bell. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday. Shares of Cooper Companies (COO) surged more than 5% in premarket trading after activist investor Jana Partners reportedly built a stake in the medical device maker. The Wall Street Journal said Jana is looking for strategic alternatives for the company, including a potential deal to combine the company’s contact lens unit with rival Bausch + Lomb (BLCO). Shares of Bausch + Lomb were down nearly 2% in premarket trading.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) went down on October 20, 2025, hitting its US-EAST-1 region hard. Millions of users lost access to platforms like Snapchat, Robinhood, Fortnite, Roblox, and Amazon.com services. Downdetector logged over 20,000 outage reports in hours. Despite the massive disruption, Amazon stock closed at $213.04, down just 0.68%, with pre-market trading at $212.27. Analysts say the outage underscores risks in cloud dependency but doesn’t immediately threaten Amazon’s stock. Investors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the earnings report.

ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG Krist Boo Published Oct 20, 2025, 04:14 AM Updated Oct 20, 2025, 07:13 AM SINGAPORE – Software engineers in Singapore are less likely than their global peers to lose their jobs to artificial intelligence (AI), owing to strong government support and the Republic’s proximity to an array of tech firms, say talent and technology players. The rise of vibe coding – where one can build apps and websites using word commands – is especially ominous for this group of computer experts. vibe coding Mr Eugene Yang, managing director for Singapore and Hong Kong at technology consultancy Palo IT, said the signs are that companies here are already reducing demand for junior developers, traditionally hired through offshore markets such as India, Vietnam, the Philippines and China. But Singapore’s smaller, more specialised tech workforce offers an opportunity. He said: “We could emerge as the AI orchestration hub for South-east Asia, managing AI agents rather than human coders.” Managing AI agents – bots that can work and learn independently without human supervision – to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks is beginning to draw attention among enterprises. Ms Rohini Saluja, managing director at real estate services firm CBRE, said the AI orchestration layer is where human oversight, ethical design and complex system integration are needed. These areas play up Singapore’s strengths – but offshore information technology (IT) offices will not disappear, she said. She noted: “Take an example of data labelling for AI training. Despite improvements in optical character recognition technology, companies continue to value quality, accuracy and the human lens for such data. “Such roles will not be feasible in higher-cost markets.” Likewise, Mr Ravi Nippani, head of regional industries and solutions at professional services firm Mercer Asia, expects businesses here to keep using offshore teams. These remote teams offer specialised skills and scale for large IT projects, as well as personalised customer interactions. They also help businesses spread their geographical operation risks. “Companies should not rush to cut offshore IT offices but rather consider transforming their offshore teams,” Mr Nippani advised. For instance, offshore offices could be upgraded from routine coding to higher-value tasks such as AI management, complex problem-solving and system design, he said. Singapore is home to around 4,500 tech firms, including the regional operations of major global tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Director for AI innovation at AI Singapore Laurence Liew expects firms to bring some of their overseas roles home when Singapore is able to offer enough AI workers at competitive wage levels. The Government has a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029, and is supporting it with apprenticeships, scholarships, reskilling initiatives and public-private collaborations. a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029 It has launched programmes such as the Skills Pathway for Cloud, offered by the Singapore Computer Society in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and SkillsFuture Singapore; IMDA’s Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; and AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme. Skills Pathway for Cloud, Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme Mr Liew said software engineers everywhere are using AI or agentic coding tools today. AI Singapore’s apprenticeship initiative aims to give the local workforce an edge by injecting AI workers with diverse backgrounds into the economy. He said: “Not all are software or computer science graduates, which makes the programme all the more valuable, as they bring their past domain experience to solve business problems.” Almost all its trainees, ranging from fresh graduates to mid-career job switchers, are hired within six months of graduation. About six in 10 find jobs before graduation, he added. The programme will produce more than 500 graduates over 20 cohorts by the middle of 2026. While engineers here are already expected to be more productive with the help of AI coding tools, higher salaries are not in the offing for now, said Mr Ethan Ang, chief executive of tech career platform NodeFlair. “The market remains employer-driven, especially after the wave of tech layoffs, and companies generally view AI adoption as a way to improve competitiveness and efficiency, rather than as a justification for higher salary negotiations,” he said. NodeFlair estimates that 80,000 to 100,000 of the 214,000 tech workers in Singapore are software engineers and developers making a median monthly salary of $6,750. Regional director John Borneman of recruitment firm Hays expects median salaries for this group to stay flat in the next 12 months. But he expects the ones who have upskilled to command more pay. “The rise of low-code platforms is reducing the need for teams writing boilerplate code, so the more skilled you are in architecture and modelling, the greater value you will add to an organisation, and the bigger the upside for your pay packet,” he said.

Title: $200B AppLovin faces data privacy probe after short-sellers allege misconduct: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/19/business/applovin-faces-data-privacy-probe-after-short-sellers-allege-misconduct-sources/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T17:58:32Z
Full Content:
Fast-growing tech giant AppLovin is facing fresh regulatory heat over its handling of consumer data –including potential investigations by multiple state attorneys general, The Post has learned. The Silicon Valley firm – a mobile advertising juggernaut worth more than $200 billion that made headlines this spring with an offer to buy TikTok – was rocked this month by a reported Securities and Exchange Commission probe over data privacy. The SEC is investigating whether AppLovin “misled investors about its data collection and ad-targeting methods” after short-sellers alleged it had used digital “fingerprints” to improperly track users for targeted ads, according to Bloomberg. On Wednesday, AppLovin said it shut down a product called “Array” that an ad researcher claimed downloaded apps onto user’s phones without their consent. The disclosure came days after researcher Ben Edelman, who holds a short position on AppLovin, claimed in an Oct. 13 report to have found source code that enabled forced downloads. Edelman’s allegations remain unsubstantiated. A rep for AppLovin responded that “users must explicitly consent to download an application as a result of any of our ads,” noting that “Array was a test product.” Meanwhile, state regulators, including staff from the attorneys general from Delaware, Oregon and Connecticut, have reached out to multiple short sellers, seemingly as part of a preliminary investigation into AppLovin, according to sources close to the situation and emails reviewed by The Post. The probe, which apparently began in March and continued through the summer, is focused on AppLovin’s data collection practices, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Delaware has taken the lead on the probe, which is thought to be in its early stages, sources said. Several third-party data brokers with ties to AppLovin have received subpoenas as part of the probe, the sources added. “We do not comment on, confirm, or deny investigations,” a spokesperson for the Delaware attorney general’s office said. When provided a detailed list of questions for comment, AppLovin said it is “not engaged in any investigations with any state attorneys general regarding its business; nor has the Company been contacted by any state attorneys general regarding any such alleged investigation.” “AppLovin operates an advertising platform with industry-consistent, platform policies and enforcement measures regarding, among other things, ad content,” the company added in a statement. “These platform policies and measures apply to both publishers and demand side users (i.e., advertisers), and specifically address things like explicit content and other ad content.’ In addition to any local data privacy and consumer protection laws, states have enforcement authority under the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law meant to shield online users 13 or younger. In 2023, a coalition of 33 states sued Meta alleging violations of COPPA. It couldn’t be learned if the state investigators were focused on potential violations of COPPA or any other specific law in their probe. So far, the allegations have done little to slow the meteoric rise of AppLovin, which has been fueled by interest in its AI-powered software that helps app developers find new users and sell advertising. The company, which claims to have built a better mousetrap in an ad tech sector long dominated by Meta and Google, has seen shares surge 80% this year and was recently added to the S&P 500. Founded in 2012 by CEO Adam Foroughi, John Krystynak and Andrew Karam, AppLovin was originally centered on mobile gaming, but has increasingly refocused its business on its app monetization software. AppLovin’s rapid rise was threatened in February by a slew of short seller reports published by firms including Fuzzy Panda Research, Muddy Waters and Culper Research. AppLovin has denied the claims in these reports. In its bombshell analysis, Fuzzy Panda alleged that AppLovin “appears to be illegally tracking children” in violation of federal law – in part by assigning unique digital “fingerprints” to underage accounts specifically labeled “do not track” and despite Apple and Google policies prohibiting the practice. Fuzzy Panda also published evidence that AppLovin allegedly served explicit and violent third-party animated ads despite parental controls being activated. Those included one that depicted a scantily clad woman being spanked by her boss and another showing an elderly grandmother being attacked with a cleaver. In the report that allegedly contributed to the probe, Fuzzy Panda said it set up a dummy account for a 10-year-old boy to test AppLovin’s alleged data tracking – and found that the firm assigned a unique ID tracking the account as it played games titled “Save The Girl!” and “Mr. Bullet 3D.” Fuzzy Panda accused AppLovin of combining those identifiers with data from third-party brokers to “enhance the fingerprint and effectively track children” in violation of federal law. In the report, Fuzzy Panda said its analysis of an old but still-accessible software development kit used by AppLovin revealed the firm was “collecting 50 different attributes from children’s devices including (geolocation data; unique device identification; and even the exact boot-up time to millisecond” that could be used to specify which users in a household were kids. The Post could not independently verify the analysis. Apple explicitly bars developers from “fingerprinting” users, underage or otherwise, in its terms of service, as did Google until it tweaked the policy in February. Culper Research alleged on Feb. 26 that it had uncovered evidence that AppLovin had “systematically deployed, then exploited incredibly dangerous app permissions that enable in-app ads themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones, with just a single click.” Culper cited research by Edelman, who later released his own report this month in which he compiled more than 200 user complaints about alleged forced downloads linked to AppLovin’s Array product, including cases where users reportedly noticed apps downloading without a notification as they watched an ad on their phone. Foroughi previously denied short seller allegations of wrongdoing in a Feb 26 blog post, writing that the company does not track kids’ data and is compliant with all app store rules. “It’s disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners,” Foroughani said at the time. When reached for comment for this story, an AppLovin rep reiterated that the short seller reports are “false and misleading” made by parties with “clear financial motivations,” and contradicted by “third party sources” as well as the company’s own statements. The allegations against AppLovin emerged as Congress steps up its efforts to protect kids online in response to several major scandals in which underage users were exposed to harmful content or privacy violations. Earlier this year, Senate lawmakers reintroduced an updated version of COPPA, which would bar targeted ads for people under age 17. Other legal challenges are brewing, including a suit by a California resident who claims that AppLovin tracked her “purchasing decisions, app usage…her movements and locations” without her permission and despite her turning off location tracking software on her phone. The complaint alleges that AppLovin continued to track her using reverse IP look-up technology and “monetized” her information to “unknown third parties.” Advertisement

Have an opinion about this? Email me your opinion at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com with the subject line “AV poll.” OK, back to the show. There’s another twist in the road for lidar company Luminar. And yes, it includes some inside-the-boardroom intrigue. First, let’s catch up. You might recall that Austin Russell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Luminar, was more or less pushed out of the company by its board following an ethics inquiry. But Russell didn’t go quietly into the night. He popped back up on our radar a few weeks ago with the launch of a new company called Russell AI Labs. And now (cue the deep and foreboding “dum dum duuuuummmm”): He has made a bid to acquire Luminar. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane broke the story, which you can read here. He has since learned a few more details beyond what is disclosed in the SEC filing. This may look like a possible hostile move — it was, after all, disclosed in a filing from Russell, and Luminar is not commenting on the proposal. But we’ve learned from a source that members of Luminar’s board approached the founder about the idea last month. (The word we were told was they “encouraged” it.) The implication here is that some of Luminar’s nine-member board really does want him back, despite the fact that three of those board members on the audit committee conducted an ethics inquiry into him just a few months ago, leading to his resignation. The proposed takeover as described in the filing is vague, but it could involve Russell AI Labs acquiring a different automotive tech company and merging it with Luminar. Since this morning, we’ve heard Russell is already trained on a few options as part of the diligence he’s done with Russell AI Labs, which he views as an incubator of sorts. Two notable deals this week occurred in the electric aviation sector. First up is Beta Technologies, which took advantage of eased SEC rules during the U.S. government shutdown to price shares for its initial public offering. The shares are priced between $27 and $33, in hopes of raising as much as $825 million. If the company attracts investors at the top of that range, it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that lets companies in IPO limbo allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule. And there is Lilium, which was involved in a very different kind of deal. The electric aircraft startup may have ceased operations a year ago, but its tech is living on over at Archer Aviation. Archer won a competitive bidding process — one that Ambitious Air Mobility Group and Joby Aviation also participated in — and bought all 300 of Lilium’s patents. The price, €18 million ($21 million), is a stunning number when compared to the more than $1 billion the defunct startup raised over its lifetime. The question is what does Archer plan to do with these patents? The company isn’t explicit, but there are some hints, which you can read about in my story. Other deals that got my attention this week … Airbound, an Indian drone startup founded in 2020, raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom. Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, joined. Dexory, a warehouse robotics startup based in London, raised $165 million in equity and debt. The $100 million Series C round was led by Eurazeo with participation from backers LTS Growth, Endeavor Catalyst, DTCP, Atomico, Lakestar, Elaia, Latitude Ventures, and Wave-X. The company also secured $65 million in debt financing from Bootstrap Europe. FleetWorks, a logistics startup developing an “always-on” AI dispatcher, raised $17 million in equity and debt, including a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A. Pony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The Chinese companies are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange. Starship Technologies, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Plural. Karma.vc, Latitude, Coefficient Capital, SmartCap, and Skaala also joined. Upciti, a Paris-based smart city software company, raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital. Other investors included Point Nine and Chalfen Ventures. Zepto, the Indian grocery delivery company, raised $450 million in funding ahead of a public listing set, Bloomberg reported. The National Transportation Safety Board has weighed in on OceanGate, the disaster that killed five people during a voyage to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The NTSB issued a report that found the Titan submersible did not meet manufacturing safety standards. Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai are working together to build robotaxis for use in Europe, albeit via a nonbinding agreement. The plan is to integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform. While Stellantis delves into autonomous vehicle tech, it is pulling back on electrification. The automaker said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. (This plan hasn’t been well received by labor unions in Canada, by the way.) Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Only one of those will be electrified, a marked difference from Stellantis’ strategy a few years ago. Uber is offering a new kind of gig work: digital tasks like uploading photos to help train AI models. Waymo is expanding to London. The company said it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo. As per usual, there was more than one piece of Waymo news. The company locked in a strategic multiyear agreement with DoorDash to deliver goods to customers in the Phoenix area using driverless vehicles. It’s been a while since Waymo has experimented with delivery. Is this a hint of what’s to come? I believe it is. Speaking of Waymo and delivery, it got me thinking about what the best business model is. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a poll, so I hope you participate if you sign up for the newsletter.

by Michael Levanduski TikTok, Shutterstock TikTok, Shutterstock Everyone knows about inflation, and shrinkflation, and a dozen other ways that big companies are trying to boost their profits. This TikToker is shining a light on a whole new method that has been called ‘trickflation,’ and I’m sure you’ve seen it before. He starts his video by saying, “There’s an exciting new way that you’re being ripped off at the grocery store! You’ve, of course, heard of shrinkflation, where manufacturers take an existing product and just shrink it a little bit. Without applying that same shrinkage to the price. You might have even heard of skimpflation, where companies keep the size and the price the same, but just switch out those pesky expensive ingredients for much cheaper ones.” It is a never-ending battle trying to save money. TikTok/earlypete He then introduces the next way they try to get you, “But the new way the grocery industry has tried to screw us is what one Reddit user calls trickflation. You see, they haven’t reduced the amount of soda. Both of these cans are still 12oz. But since the grocery industry thinks the average consumer has the intelligence of a six-year-old child, they’ve put that same 12oz of soda in what looks like a larger can.” Why am I not surprised? Make people think they are getting more when they actually aren’t. TikTok/earlypete He continues, “No, of course, this trickflation only works if they eliminate the previous can, and jack up the price. Which is, of course, exactly what they did.” Great, so it is basically just raising prices with extra steps. TikTok/earlypete He finishes his video by saying, “So, not only do we have to worry about our products shrinking in size, or using ingredients of much lower quality, but we now have to worry about what is almost indisputably deceptive behavior.” They will do anything to keep their profit margins up. Hopefully, people will wise up to this and start shopping with companies that don’t do this type of thing. But I doubt it. Watch the full video below to see what you think. If it didn’t make me so angry, I would honestly be impressed with the creativity the grocery industry comes up with to rip us off #foodfacts#groceryhaul#exposed ♬ In The Hall Of The Mountain King/Grieg – もつ The people in the comments totally support this video. Check them out for yourself. This commenter says those cans actually cost more, too. I mean, this person isn’t wrong. Oh yes, a classic. Just keep paying more, you’ll keep getting less.

Title: S&P 500 Earnings Surge: Magnificent 7 Lead As Recession Odds Plunge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/10/19/sp-500-earnings-surge-magnificent-7-lead-as-recession-odds-plunge/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its third-busiest week, which includes an earnings report from one of the Magnificent 7. 88 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Coca-Cola (KO), 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), and Procter & Gamble (PG). With relatively few companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 8.5% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 11.0%, and for 2026, it is 13.9%. A strong start to earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Bank earnings were well above expectations, sending the expected year-over-year earnings growth rate for the financials sector to 18.2%. However, there was a scare after some smaller banks, Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), reported loan fraud. Additionally, JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned of “cockroaches” in the credit market on his earnings conference call. The mega-banks, JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), can offset small loan losses thanks to robust trading and investment banking revenues. Still, the smaller regional banks don’t have that luxury, causing the regional bank stock index to plunge while the large bank index is sharply higher for the year. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 are expected to grow earnings by 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter, while the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 should grow at 6.7%. The first of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), is scheduled to report results this week. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises by Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 last week. The blended earnings growth rate for the financials sector increased to 18.2% from 13.2%. The energy sector is expected to experience the most significant year-over-year earnings decline due to lower oil prices. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 6.6% is above expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, energy-sector revenues should see the most significant year-over-year decline. The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. With almost no US economic releases on the calendar due to the government shutdown, the focus will be on earnings. In addition to being the third-busiest week of earnings reports this season, the breadth of companies reporting is expanding further beyond the banks. Despite the lack of government economic reports and the government shutdown, the economy is holding up just fine, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 5%. Economic and market sentiment was helped last week by President Trump indicating that the massive tariffs on China were unsustainable and Fed Chair Powell reinforcing the case for two more rate cuts this year. As the earnings season heats up beyond the financials, earnings will be monitored closely. Given the additional economic visibility issues due to the government shutdown, forward earnings guidance from management will be even more closely watched.

Title: The AI revolution's next casualty could be the gig economy

A woman who's been driving for Uber for more than a decade explains how she's looking for new work as her pay drops. Tomorrow's the big launch of First Trade, our new markets newsletter led by Joe Ciolli. Subscribe here! On the agenda today: But first: There's a new gig in town. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The gig economy is facing a reckoning. Two stories this past week caught my eye. Uber unveiled a new way for its drivers to earn money. No, not by giving rides, but by helping train the ride-sharing company's AI models instead. On the same day, Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to test driverless grocery and meal deliveries. Both moves point toward the same future: one where the very workers who built the gig economy may soon find themselves training the technology that replaces them. Uber's new program allows drivers to earn cash by completing microtasks, such as taking photos and uploading audio clips, that aim to improve the company's AI systems. For drivers, it's a way to diversify income. For Uber, it's a way to accelerate its automated future. There's an irony here. By helping Uber strengthen its AI, drivers could be accelerating the very driverless world they fear. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said human drivers won't vanish overnight. Still, he has warned that the eventual decline of driving jobs poses a significant societal challenge to the gig economy. Uber already offers autonomous rides in Waymo vehicles in Atlanta and Austin, and plans to expand. Meanwhile, Waymo is rolling out its pilot partnership with DoorDash, starting in Phoenix. DashMart stores are expected to be the first retailer on the platform. BI reported that customers may be asked to pay a delivery charge — just like they would for typical DoorDash orders — but there will be no need to tip the driver because, well, there's no driver. All of this is ripe fodder for a virtual event Business Insider is hosting on Wednesday, where we'll explore how AI and automation are reshaping the self-driving revolution. I'll be speaking with automotive innovators, AI experts, and urban mobility leaders. The best part about the event — it's free! Hope to see you there. AI startup Friend offers a $129 necklace that aims to help solve the loneliness crisis by going with you everywhere. If the oft-graffitied subway ads are any indication, New Yorkers aren't buying it. BI's Amanda Hoover tested out the necklace for a week. While the bot could hold a conversation, Hoover wasn't convinced it really counted as a friend. What it got wrong about friendship. Also read: Last month, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban joined the ranks of broken-up couples where the woman outearns the man. That particular ending is more common than you may think. Divorce rates for heterosexual couples go up when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, and they go down when the opposite is true. It shows how women's economic progress is clashing with old expectations about marriage, an executive coach said. But it doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. As of this month, the Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports, according to an internal list obtained by BI. The list offers a glimpse into the group of leaders at the top of the world's most valuable company. Last year, Huang said he had 55 direct reports. He's known for having many people report into him, and has said it helps with information flow. Here's who's reporting to Huang. Amazon Web Services is feeling a shift in one of its biggest clientele segments, according to internal documents obtained by BI. Startups, which typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to AWS, are instead spending it on AI tools. "Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage," the company warned in one of the documents. The shift represents a massive threat to AWS, which holds a firm grip on the lucrative startup ecosystem. More on Cloud 2.0. This week's quote: "When a brand becomes iconic, simplicity is the ultimate flex." — Matt Sia, executive creative director at design services firm Pearlfisher, on Apple TV ditching the plus sign. How Arizona tea has kept its 99-cent price tag Iced tea cans from Arizona Beverages have had the same price point since 1992. That famous price tag was once under threat, though.

Trade is the talk of the town this week. Investors will be watching for updates on trade policy ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping, as well as a highly anticipated inflation reading, after a volatile week of trading marked by worries about bad loans at regional banks. Friday’s release of the Consumer Price Index for September, delayed by the government shutdown, is likely the last major piece of data the Federal Reserve will receive before its interest rate decision next week. Other government reports could remain delayed until there is a resolution to the budget dispute in Washington. Magnificent 7 member Tesla is set to report earnings Wednesday, when CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on the electric vehicles maker's advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, after a torrid rally in recent months. Intel’s report will be in focus after a flurry of investments in the struggling chipmaker boosted its stock. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Tesla’s scheduled earnings release Wednesday follows stronger-than-expected deliveries as buyers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits. Big Three automakers Ford and General Motors, also set to report this week, likely benefited from the same tailwinds, though both automakers have scaled back their EV ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on developments in the company's high-tech offerings beyond EVs, including an expansion of its robotaxi services, its Optimus robots, and self-driving technology. Intel’s report, due Thursday, comes as the U.S. chipmaker’s shares have surged after a string of deals including one that saw the U.S. government take a stake and a partnership with AI leader Nvidia. Netflix’s report comes after the streamer recently raised its prices and boosted its revenue outlook. Updates from Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble could bring some insights into consumer spending, while Friday’s earnings from HCA Healthcare may offer a look into the hospital sector. Gold miner Newmont’s report on Thursday arrives as the precious metal has set a string of new all-time highs . With many economic reports in limbo due to the federal shutdown, Friday's CPI inflation report could be the last major piece of economic data the Fed gets before issuing a decision on interest rates next week. Forecasters expect the report to show prices continuing to rise, but at a slower pace than in August. The data could influence whether the Fed will continue with its plans to keep lowering interest rates. Fed officials have said their focus is turning to the weakening labor market, which would favor rate cuts. But higher-than-expected inflation could push them to reconsider. While the release of new home sales data is likely to be delayed, market watchers will still see on Thursday the National Association of Realtors’ existing home sales data for September, as economists look for signs of a resurgence in an anemic housing market. The week will also bring fresh figures on consumer sentiment and Purchasing Managers Index surveys for October. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Latest Markets News Monday, Oct. 20 Tuesday, Oct. 21 Wednesday, Oct. 22 Thursday, Oct. 23 Friday, Oct. 24 Banking fees are rising at one major bank, with new waiver rules for checking accounts taking effect this month.

Title: Hideo Kojima Says AI Is “A Friend,” Not a Threat to Creativity in Game Development
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Hideo-Kojima-Says-AI-Is-A-Friend-Not-a-Threat-to-Creativity-in-Game-Development.1141848.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-19T01:46:00Z
Full Content:
Hideo Kojima recently shared an optimistic view on artificial intelligence, framing it not as a threat to the games industry or to human creativity for that matter, but a collaborative “friend’ that can handle the more time-consuming aspects of game development. In a recent interview with Wired Japan, Kojima highlighted that while many in the industry use AI to generate ideas, he views it differently, stating: “A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas. But I think of AI as more of a friend… I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency.” Kojima’s perspective on the use of AI and its role in creative workflows comes amid a time when many companies like Activision, Level-5, and Capcom are using AI. A recent survey in June and July found that 32% of CESA member companies are using AI to develop in-house game engines, extend to visual game assets, generate text, and assist in programming. It’s pretty surprising how much of a foothold AI already has in gaming, considering some companies have been quite open about their use of AI in pretty much everything from visual upscaling to code generation, even as user and developer pushback continues on multiple mediums. Kojima's approach shows how AI can be used to streamline monotonous tasks such as animation, motion capture, and NPC behaviors without supplanting the core creative process in video game development. He further added in the Wired interview, saying, I’d like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower the cost and cut down on time. It’s more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead, creating together with AI. Kojima’s stance on the use of AI stands in stark contrast to the push toward full automation in some sectors, maintaining AI as a tool for efficiency rather than a complete substitute. For instance, during the development of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Kojima Productions employed machine learning for scanning actors, including Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, to create digital models. While Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has been praised for its high-fidelity visuals, realistic character models, and facial animations, Kojima himself views the result as merely “okay” and seeks even greater realism in future endeavors like OD and Physint. At the New Global Sport Conference in Riyadh in August, he discussed a few challenges during Death Stranding 2’s production, and mentioned: We scanned and we made a rig, an AI machine learning rig. We took so much time and made sure that we scanned them into digital, but made sure that they move analog in a way. And it took so much time. Looking back, I think it’s okay. But my next project, I think I want to make it more realistic. Debates over the use of AI in the game industry continue unabated, even as it remains the leading cause for layoffs in an industry struggling to find sustained profitability. While some developers are aiming for total automation, Kojima’s vision for using AI as a co-creator could help reduce game development costs, while making sure humans remain at the helm of innovation.Buy Death Stranding 2: On The Beach on Amazon Wired - Instagram

Title: Banjo-Kazooie director Gregg Mayles leaves Rare after 36 years as he announces exit on X
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Banjo-Kazooie-director-Gregg-Mayles-leaves-Rare-after-36-years-as-he-announces-exit-on-X.1141847.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-19T00:58:00Z
Full Content:
Gregg Mayles, the director behind Banjo-Kazooie, has finally bid farewell to Rare after an impressive 36 years at the British studio. Mayles, who joined Rare in 1989 straight out of high school, announced his exit on X in poetic alliteration, titled “A Rather Resplendent Rewarding Rare Ramble,” fittingly referencing the rhyming dialogue that defined Banjo-Kazooie. The poem basically recounts his journey, from his early days ignoring banking for game design to contributing to hits like Battletoads, Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Viva Piñata, and Sea of Thieves, while expressing gratitude to fans and colleagues. He ended the post with the line “Now time to start new tales to tell, Farewell to Rare, he waves, farewell!” Over his tenure, Mayles worked on 30 games, helping shape Rare’s golden era during the Nintendo 64 heyday. He contributed to classics such as the 1998 platformer Banjo-Kazooie, which sold over 3.6 million copies worldwide and spawned sequels like Banjo-Tooie in 2000. He also contributed to many other beloved titles, including the 1994 beat ‘em up Battletoads, the Donkey Kong series starting with Donkey Kong Country in 1994, the 2003 Xbox horror-comedy Grabbed by the Ghoulies, the 2006 life sim Viva Pinata, and most recently, directed the live-service hit pirate adventure multiplayer game, Sea of Thieves, which launched in 2018 and has since amassed more than 40 million players across all platforms. This announcement comes amid a turbulent and dark period for Rare, following Microsoft’s acquisition of the studio in 2002 for $375 million, after which it shifted focus from Nintendo to Xbox. While Sea of Thieves stands as Rare’s most successful release, the studio had nonetheless faced many hiccups throughout the years, like 2013's Kinect Sports. Notable here is ambitious open-world adventure Everwild, whose development was being overseen by Gregg Mayles himself. The game was announced in 2019 and had been in development for over five years. However, Microsoft canceled Everwild in July 2025 as part of broader layoffs, affecting up to 9000 employees company-wide. This also included cuts at Rare and the scrapping of The Initiative's Perfect Dark Reboot, another project tied to Rare’s legacy. Sources report that the cancellation of Everwild, after nearly a decade of troubled development and multiple reboots, likely influenced Mayles' decision to leave Rare. However, he didn’t specify the reason in his post on X. Gregg Mayles - X

Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google. Amazon-owned home security company Ring has partnered with Flock Safety, a company whose network of AI-assisted cameras is used by thousands of law enforcement agencies across the US—just weeks after announcing a similar tie-up with security firm Axon Enterprise. The partnerships will allow police to send requests to Ring camera owners when they're trying to track down footage that could help in an ongoing investigation. The requests must include a specific location and timeframe, as well as details about what is being investigated. This Community Requests feature is optional; agencies can’t see who received a notification or who chose not to respond. You can also turn off Community Request notifications altogether.

Amazon-owned home security company Ring has partnered with Flock Safety, a company whose network of AI-assisted cameras is used by thousands of law enforcement agencies across the US—just weeks after announcing a similar tie-up with security firm Axon Enterprise. The partnerships will allow police to send requests to Ring camera owners when they're trying to track down footage that could help in an ongoing investigation. The requests must include a specific location and timeframe, as well as details about what is being investigated. This Community Requests feature is optional; agencies can’t see who received a notification or who chose not to respond. You can also turn off Community Request notifications altogether.

Title: 'Deploying More Capital — Steady Lads': Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggle to Halt Plunge
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/18/deploying-more-capital-steady-lads-bitcoin-treasury-companies-struggle-to-halt-crash
Time Published: 2025-10-18T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
Is crypto winter coming? It's already more than set in for bitcoin treasury companies (BTCTC). Aiming to replicate the once-in-a-generation success of Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) and perhaps taking advantage of a U.S. regulatory regime that is willing to look the other way at questionable public offerings, a wave of crypto asset treasury companies have gone public in 2025. The result has been massive investor losses nearly across the board. And while the plunge in the price of bitcoin BTC$110,627.52 over the past 11 days (yes, it was only Monday, Oct. 3 when BTC peaked above $126,000) can be blamed for some of the carnage, BTCTC share prices were tumbling well prior to that. Checking a small group of BTCTCs, losses over the past three months range from "just" 38% in the case of Strategy to 94% for KindlyMD (NAKA). As his TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin began de-pegging from the dollar in May 2022, Do Kwon famously tweeted, "Deploying more capital — steady lads." Within days, TerraUSD, which had previously commanded a market cap of about $50 billion, was worthless. That social media post has gone on to become a meme for the crypto community whenever things start to look questionable for the markets or any companies. This isn't to suggest any level of comparable shiftiness or criminality, or to predict the future BTCTCs, but some of the executive teams at these firms have recently been uber-busy on social networks in defense of their business models. Simon Gerovich, CEO of Japan's Metaplanet (MTPLF) — which remains higher since it adopted the BTCTC strategy in 2024, but has had a 70% share price decline over the past three months — on Friday attempted to make the case for why a shift to preferred stock issuance will deliver strong returns to shareholders. "When bitcoin appreciates faster than the cost of capital, that difference compounds into greater bitcoin per share and the benefit accrues to the common shareholders," he said in a post on X. The tl;dr: Metaplanet investors will benefit if "number go up." KindlyMD CEO David Bailey — whose 94% share plunge over the past three months has left the stock price below $1 and in danger of being delisted by the Nasdaq — on Thursday found it necessary to deny the claims of an X poster that his company had "FTX vibes." "In no way is there any similarity to FTX," said Bailey. "We’re a regulated, registered security that buys and holds bitcoin." When the CEO of publicly traded company has to respond to a random s--tposter to say "we're not FTX," it's safe to say the plot may have been lost. Then there was Strive (ASST) CIO Ben Werkman — whose share price plunge has nearly matched that of NAKA and also faces delisting danger — attempting to explain the difficulties and a way forward. "Now the exuberance is gone, and many companies are now in position with their balance sheets intact to be able to move to the second phase of the journey," said Werkman in an extremely long post to X. "Achieving scale is difficult, but now many companies have it," he continued. "Valuations are reaching what I would consider deep value territory (just based on balance sheets alone), and these are the valuations where many investors will place their bets for the long term." Werkman went on to remind that many assumed Saylor's Strategy (then MicroStrategy) was going to zero in 2022's crypto winter. Those who faded that assumption were rewarded with mind-boggling returns. MSTR was trading at about $30 when Do Kwon made his "steady lads" post. Even after their recent decline, the shares are still at $290 — or nearly a 10-bagger over the last three and a half years. Whatever the future may hold for the BTCTCs, one thing is for sure: the vibes are anything but positive at the moment. If any of the latecomers are going to mirror the massive success of first mover Strategy, it could require a lot more than just a rising bitcoin price.

Title: Ready To Retire? These 8%+ CEFs Show The Way

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I’m regularly struck by something American investors always seem to take for granted: The many choices we have available to gain financial independence. And investors in closed-end funds (CEFs) make the most of these choices. These high-yielding funds kick out 8%+ dividends on average, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service, which helps investors make the most of CEFs, pays even more, with its 18 holdings paying a rich average yield of 9.4%. Plus, these funds offer stock-like upside, which makes them pretty much tailor-made for delivering financial freedom. We’ll sketch out how two specific CEFs can help you find your way to an earlier, richer retirement in a bit. But first, back to that embarrassment of choices I mentioned a second ago. Back in my 20s, when I was studying to get my PhD in Europe, I was told I had to pay into the national pension fund, and I would get that money back when I qualified for it. At that time, I qualified at 62, which seemed absurd—nearly 40 years for me (a severely underpaid academic!) to get back money I desperately needed today. But as it turns out, I was lucky. Europe’s mandatory retirement age is rising. Denmark, which currently has the oldest retirement age in Europe at 67, is raising that to 70. Germany, where a normal retirement age is currently 66, is discussing raising that to 73. Whether you like the life of a worker or not, I’m almost certain that you like having the ability to choose that life without having to worry about governments changing the rules on you mid-game. This lack of choice pushed me away from Europe in my 20s and led me back to America. Here’s what I found when I returned. This chart shows that the average American household has gone from $200k in savings in the 1980s to $1.2 million now—and, no, that isn’t due to inflation. That $200k in savings would be $535k in 2025 dollars, so more than half of the jump to $1.2 million is due to actual value being created. Of course, that wealth isn’t going everywhere. While all households have gotten richer on average, the top 0.1% of the population is attracting a greater proportion of overall wealth in the US, now near 14%. The ethics of this aside, it’s clear that the households that have more wealth now have more choices—about when to retire, where to live, what lifestyle to adopt and so on. In a way, it seems like Europeans have too little choice and Americans have so much that retirement investing can be tough for individual investors to navigate without either taking undue risks or locking themselves into weak returns. This is where CEFs come in, with their focus on assets from well-established companies. Plus their high yields almost act like a “mini-pension,” boosting your income without leaving you at the whim of the government. This is the way I viewed CEFs in my late 20s, when I began using their high dividends to get the income I needed to make the choices I wanted. I still view them this way. And in addition to their big dividends, these funds often chalk up strong returns, too, thanks in large part to their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). As these discounts—which only apply to CEFs, by the way—shrink, they put upward pressure on the fund’s price. And the best part is that CEFs are easy to buy, trading on public markets just like stocks. Consider the first CEF we’re looking at today, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). It’s one of the oldest funds in the world, tracing its history back to the 19th century (and is a current CEF Insider holding, too). This one is about as blue chip as it gets, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) among its top holdings. What’s more—and this is the key part—ADX trades at an 8.3% discount to NAV as I write this, and that discount is in the sweet spot, cheaper than it was a few months ago but carrying momentum as it steams toward par. ADX has been paying dividends since before the Great Depression, and its 8.3% dividend yield is fully covered by the 13.3% total NAV return (or the return on its underlying portfolio) it’s enjoyed over the last decade. Moreover, ADX has delivered a 5,340% return to its shareholders, with dividends reinvested, since the late 1980s, when US household wealth just started to meaningfully tick higher. That kind of performance—coming our way at a discount and with an 8.3% dividend—is exactly what we want from our “mini-pension,” and ADX delivers. But, as I said, we do have choices here. And ADX isn’t the only US-stock-focused CEF that delivers a large income stream and has withstood the test of time. Another is the General American Investors Company (GAM), which was launched in 1927 and yielded an impressive 9.4% to investors in 2024. GAM also holds large caps, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. And, like ADX, this fund’s market price–based return has been strong over the last decade—though not quite as strong as ADX—with a 14.4% annualized return. Moreover, GAM’s 9.3% discount sounds like a good deal, but that’s near its smallest-ever level, so we’re not rushing out to buy the fund today. But it is worth watching, and gets tempting when that discount drops to double digits. But the larger point remains: With high-yielding CEFs like these, we can start generating a meaningful income stream we can choose to use however we like.
