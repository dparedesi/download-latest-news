Nearly 400 people who say they are "a person of wealth" signed an open letter calling for global leaders to increase taxes on the superrich. Signatories of the letter, which was addressed to leaders at the World Economic Forum's Davos conference this week, include actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno. The letter said that a few ultrawealthy people are negatively influencing nearly every aspect of society. "A handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth have bought up our democracies; taken over our governments; gagged the freedom of our media; placed a stranglehold on technology and innovation; deepened poverty and social exclusion; and accelerated the breakdown of our planet," the letter read. They said that higher taxes, on people — including themselves — was the solution. "As our elected representatives—whether it's those of you at Davos, local councillors, city mayors, or regional leaders—it's your duty to deliver it," it said. "So tax us. Tax the super rich." The annual WEF conference has gathered some of the world's richest and most powerful people in the Swiss mountain town. Business Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near Davos, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. They included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Jets from companies like Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma also arrived in the area. In April, President Donald Trump said he wouldn't mind paying more in taxes himself, but he's not convinced that he should raise taxes on millionaires. "I think it would be very disruptive, because a lot of the millionaires would leave the country," Trump said. "The old days, they left states. They go from one state to the other. Now with transportation so quick and so easy, they leave countries." Trump said the US would "lose a lot of money" if the country raised taxes on millionaires. Oxfam reported this week that a record number of billionaires were created last year, bringing the global total to more than 3,000 for the first time. Billionaire wealth has increased by 81% since 2020, the study found. The tax petition was organized by the nonprofits Patriotic Millionaires, Millionaires for Humanity, and development charity Oxfam. The letter is published on a website that allows more people who identify as "a person of wealth" to also sign their names. Jump to

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto’s BTC stash – 17 years later, how much is it worth?

Seventeen years of untouched Bitcoin outweighs any single week of tariffs, sell-offs, or headline-driven volatility. The cryptocurrency market is currently caught between short-term global shocks and the long-term confidence of Bitcoin’s earliest holders. At the time of writing, Bitcoin [BTC] was trading at $89,490, down over 3% in the last 24 hours. Its latest drop was triggered by rising global trade concerns after U.S President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on eight European countries. While short-term traders moved money into safer assets like gold, blockchain data revealed that long-term Bitcoin holders remain confident. According to Arkham Intelligence, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has now held their original Bitcoin holdings for 17 years without moving them. What started at $0 in 2009 grew to $4,500 in 2010, $317,000 in 2011, $5.5 million in 2012, $14.5 million in 2013, and $827 million in 2014. Through every boom, crash, and headline since, all that Bitcoin has remained untouched. Today, 17 years later, Satoshi’s holdings are worth around $100 billion. This contrast highlights the current mood in the market. Even though retail investors might be nervous, exchange data seemed to suggest that the latest sell-off was not random. In fact, it looked more like a planned move by large players. Over the last 24 hours alone, some of the biggest players in the crypto industry moved large amounts of Bitcoin to exchanges at the same time. Source: X In total, more than 64,000 BTC was added to the sell side. This sudden hike in supply made it harder for Bitcoin’s price to move higher. When large institutions and market makers sell at the same time, it often points to a planned move rather than panic. These actions are usually meant to push the price lower, while also triggering stop-loss orders and forcing highly leveraged retail traders out of the market. And yet, despite short-term price swings, Bitcoin’s ownership remains heavily concentrated among long-term holders. According to Arkham Intelligence’s latest blog post, while the list of Bitcoin’s largest holders has been changing, the top spot remains the same. Satoshi Nakamoto is still the largest holder, with 1,096,358 BTC, or about 5.5% of the total supply. Following Satoshi’s lead is Coinbase, which holds 884,675 BTC, worth about $82 billion, or 4.4% of the total supply. BlackRock is third, with its holdings valued at $72 billion or 3.9% of supply. Strategy and the U.S government come in at 4th and 5th, with their holdings amounting to $38 billion and $30 billion, respectively. For its part, Tether has 96,369 BTC, representing approximately 0.48% of Bitcoin’s total supply. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s Dominance was strong with a reading of 59.76%. However, other on-chain datasets suggested that retail investors may be becoming less active. In fact, the 7-day average of active Bitcoin addresses has been declining since October 2025’s price peak. Source: The Block In the past, this has usually meant that smaller investors were reducing activity due to fear or uncertainty. However, this trend often happens just before institutions take a bigger role. Finally, while the number of active users has been falling, total on-chain transaction volume climbed on the charts again. Source: The Block Such a pattern usually means that large holders are quietly buying while the prices are lower. To put it simply, Bitcoin has evolved from being worth nothing in 2009 to creating a $100 billion fortune for its creator. This is evidence of the fact that its long-term value is not shaped by a few days of negative headlines.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans China trip amid push to reopen key market — Check out his itinerary

Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang is planning to travel to China in late January as he works to reopen a crucial market for his company’s artificial intelligence chips. Huang will be in the country to attend company parties ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, according to a person familiar with the matter. The executive is also expected to visit Beijing, though it’s unclear whether he will meet with senior Chinese officials, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Huang’s itinerary could still change, depending on whether prospective meetings come through. The China visit — a trip that Huang regularly takes at this time of year — comes at a pivotal moment for the world’s most valuable company. The US is loosening export restrictions on AI processors, letting Nvidia sell its H200 model in the Asian nation. But on the Chinese side, government officials are deciding how many of the chips to let in. Beijing plans to approve imports of the products as soon as this quarter for certain uses, Bloomberg News has reported. A representative for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia declined to comment. China, the largest market for semiconductors, is looking to build up its homegrown chip industry and decrease reliance on US products. For now, though, local producers can’t match the capabilities of Nvidia’s processors, which are used to develop and run AI models. Though the H200 is a generation behind the Nvidia chips available in the US, it’s still seen as more powerful than Chinese offerings. Due to security concerns, Beijing will bar the H200 chip from the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure and state-owned enterprises, people familiar with the matter have said. That mirrors similar measures that the Chinese government adopted for foreign products such as Apple Inc. devices and Micron Technology Inc. chips. During a China trip in July, Huang managed to secure meetings with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. He also celebrated the Lunar New Year holidays with his employees in China in January 2025, opting to skip US President Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony. On Wednesday, Huang is scheduled to appear at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he’ll be interviewed by BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink. Meanwhile, the US is imposing a 25% tariff on certain advanced semiconductors ahead of their shipment to China, a move aimed at fulfilling Trump’s desire for a surcharge on the sales. Washington has also stipulated additional requirements for H200 licensing applications. Exporters have to certify that approved China shipments won’t create a shortage in the US market. And companies must ensure that production for Chinese customers won’t displace manufacturing capacity that could be used to make chips for American buyers. Even with those restrictions, letting China buy Nvidia AI chips remains controversial among US lawmakers. In a hearing last week, US Representative Brian Mast said that China “would likely overtake us in the AI arms race” if the country had free access to Nvidia processors. The Florida Republican, who chairs the House panel on foreign affairs, added that Nvidia chips are far better than anything China can make domestically. Mast went further on social media over the weekend, accusing Huang and his “paid minions” of “fighting to sell millions of advanced AI chips to Chinese military companies like Alibaba and Tencent.” In the same post on X, Mast challenged Huang to debate him on Fox News. The lawmaker is working to advance a draft bill that would introduce arms-style congressional oversight over the sale of advanced AI chips and give the legislative branch the ability to block H200 sales through a joint resolution. Huang has said that such power should remain with Trump and the Department of Commerce. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Time Published: 2026-01-21T02:10:29Z
Full Content:
Microsoft CEO and Chairman Satya Nadella on Tuesday issued a rare warning about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), saying that if it stays limited to big tech companies and wealthy economies, and does not spread to other areas, the ongoing AI boom may turn into a bubble. Speaking with BlackRock Chair and CEO Laurence D. Fink, at a session during the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella said that the long-term success of AI would depend on the fast-advancing technology being deployed across a broad range of industries, as well as through adoption by countries outside the developed world. “For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” Nadella said at the forum. It will be a "tell-tale" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focuses only on the supply side or on technology companies, rather than on adoption across sectors and the industry as a whole, he warned. Nadella stressed that he was confident AI would become more transformative across industries. “I am much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he said. He said the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate their trials. He said that an increasing amount of data from big tech companies, including Microsoft, has shown an unequal adoption rate of AI, implying that productivity benefits and work applications are restricted to wealthier countries and companies. Nadella called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. He noted how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and reshaping the way we work. “We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,” the Microsoft CEO said. Nadella added that the strongest challenge with AI is ensuring its rapid and equitable diffusion across the world. “I think when it comes to AI, the real question in front of all of us is how do you ensure that the diffusion of AI happens, and happens fast,” he said. Nadella also discussed the need for public-private cooperation to ensure that the AI revolution is supported by adequate energy infrastructure and examined data sovereignty and the risk of a so-called AI bubble.

Title: BlackRock partners with Delaware Life to bring Bitcoin into fixed index annuities

This partnership signifies a shift in retirement planning, integrating cryptocurrency exposure into traditional financial products, potentially broadening market appeal. Powered by Gloria Delaware Life Insurance Company, which provides annuity-based retirement solutions through a nationwide network of financial advisors, is partnering with BlackRock to bring Bitcoin into its fixed indexed annuities via the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index. A fixed indexed annuity is a contract with an insurance company designed to offer growth potential tied to a market index while protecting the principal from losses. The annuity credits interest based on the performance of a specific index, with gains limited by caps or participation rates. The account grows tax-deferred, and many FIAs allow the accumulated balance to be converted into a guaranteed income stream during retirement. Under the partnership, Delaware Life has added the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index to three of its products, including Momentum Growth, Momentum Growth Plus, and DualTrack Income. “We’re proud to partner with BlackRock as the first insurance carrier to offer cryptocurrency exposure through a fixed index annuity,” said Colin Lake, President & CEO of Delaware Life Marketing. “As the retirement-planning landscape evolves, we’re continuously and thoughtfully innovating to meet the needs of financial professionals and their clients.” BlackRock’s benchmark blends US stocks and Bitcoin exposure into a single benchmark, using dynamic cash allocations to maintain a 12% volatility target. Bitcoin exposure is delivered through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management and liquidity. According to Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, the launch responds to growing demand for IBIT and enables insurance clients to integrate Bitcoin exposure into a diversified annuity strategy. The index is designed to offer measured participation in digital assets while preserving the principal protection annuities provide, he stated.

Title: Palantir CEO says AI will eliminate the need for mass immigration
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/20/palantir-ceo-says-ai-will-eliminate-need-mass-immigration/

UPDATED 20:39 EST / JANUARY 20 2026 by James Farrell Palantir Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp said he believes that when the world hits peak artificial intelligence, there will be so many jobs on offer that mass immigration will be obsolete. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp (pictured) said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill.” Karp, who Forbes says has a net worth of around $14.3 billion, used himself as an example of job displacement when he talked about his Ph.D. in philosophy. “Elite” white-collar workers like him, he said, will be the first to be affected by the great job disruption. Vocational workers, he believes, will hold on for longer. His 30-minute conversation with BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink has already drawn criticism from the media, which was quick to point out that these titans of the military-industrial complex and surveillance industry may not have their feet firmly on the ground. Karp often has called himself as a “card-carrying progressive,” and not too long ago said his company’s surveillance technology would not be used to track immigrants in the U.S., according to a recent article in The Washington Post. Nonetheless, Palantir’s software has played a major role in helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement unearth undocumented immigrants and deport them in line with the current administration’s mass deportation campaign. Karp was once a critic of mass deportations, but he has more recently aligned himself with President Trump, describing his company’s technology as “anti-woke” and praising the immigration crackdowns. If his predictions hold, it won’t be long until crackdowns on undocumented workers become a thing of the past, along with liberal arts degrees, because, according to Karp, AI “will destroy humanities jobs.” Some executives attending the conference told Business Insider that they believe critical thinking skills will actually become a much sought-after commodity. Anthropic PBC Chief Executive Dario Amodei said the technicians that Karp values so highly are not in demand at his company, as software and coding roles decline.

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios discusses the Trump administration’s push on AI, data center expansion and innovation on ‘Mornings with Maria.’ Palantir CEO Alex Karp suggested Tuesday that usage of artificial intelligence "bolsters civil liberties," while also warning Europe that its adoption of technology is falling behind the U.S. and China. In a wide-ranging conversation with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Karp said his company powers "tons and tons of hospitals," but that they all have an "intake problem" and a "shortage of doctors and nurses." "They are working in a low-margin environment, but every single one has a different way of processing their patients, according to what their specialty is and the kind of patients they don't do well with, and how do you manage that? And so the intake flow and into your enterprise in a way that you can actually process these things 10, 15 times faster than you could before," Karp said. "It saves a lot of lives." "Despite what people may want to believe, it also bolsters civil liberties, because now you can see, well, I mean, just simple questions — Was someone processed based on economic considerations, or were they processed based on their background? Like those things are impossible to see, unless you have, like, there's a huge civil liberties betterment side of this that typically people don't believe we care about or, but it's actually exactly the opposite," he continued.

It's like we can granularly show why someone came in, why they were taken, why they were rejected, and we can do it in a way that makes business sense for the business itself," Karp said. When asked by Fink if AI is going to create a greater imbalance in the world in terms of growth, Karp said, "Well, I think the obvious first imbalance is, it seems like America and China understand versions of making this work, and they're different, but they both work, and they work at scale, and I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible." "Like the discount rate, I think, not in the short term, but in the long term is way too high on what will be done and how this will impact every aspect of our society," Karp added. He also said: "The tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very, very structural problem, and what scares me the most is, I haven't seen any political leader just stand up and say we have a serious and structural problem that we are going to fix."

(Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via / Getty Images) When asked if he thought AI was going to create or destroy jobs overall, Karp said, "I think one of the unfortunate things of the narrative in the West is, it will destroy humanities jobs." "But like technicians. If you are a vocational technician. Or, like, we're building batteries for a battery company and the people who are doing it in America are doing roughly the same job that Japanese engineers are doing, and they went to high school," he continued. "And now, they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were, very rapidly. And those jobs are going to become more valuable."

Title: Nvidia Vs. Dogecoin: A Historic Ratio Suggests A Possible Rotation, Says Trader
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/nvidia-vs-dogecoin-historic-ratio-rotation/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T01:00:31Z
Full Content:
Trader Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) is arguing that an old relative-value signal is “back” in crypto markets, pointing to the DOGE/NVIDIA ratio and an unusually depressed Dogecoin RSI reading as evidence that capital could rotate from AI-linked equities into high-beta meme coins. In a post on X, Cryptollica said the DOGE/NVIDIA chart has returned to a long-term support zone that previously preceded outsized Dogecoin outperformance versus Nvidia in prior cycles. “THE SIGNAL IS BACK. IT’S HAPPENING AGAIN (2017… 2021… NOW),” the trader wrote. “The last two times this specific signal flashed on the DOGE/NVIDIA chart, we saw the biggest wealth transfer in history. The crowd is chasing the AI top. The algorithm is loading the Meme bottom. (Altcoin bottom).” The core claim is less about Dogecoin in isolation and more about positioning on a ratio between what Cryptollica framed as two cultural extremes: “You are watching the wrong chart. This is the ratio of ‘The World’s Most Valuable Company’ (AI) vs. ‘The World’s Most Famous Meme’.” From that framing, the trader leans into a cycle-rhymes narrative, asserting that the ratio has repeatedly found channel support before a DOGE-led surge. “Structure is repeating history,” Cryptollica wrote, attaching specific historical comparisons. “2017: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 100x. 2021: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 50x. NOW: We are back at the exact same support line.” The posts also attach a broader liquidity-rotation story that has circulated in various forms across risk markets: when one trade stops working, capital seeks the next high-beta outlet: “When the AI Bubble exhales, that liquidity doesn’t vanish. It rotates into High-Beta Speculation,” the trader wrote. “The crowd is buying NVDA at the top. The algorithm is positioning for the DOGE reversal.” In another post, Cryptollica shifted from the ratio to Dogecoin’s weekly momentum indicator, sharing a second chart highlighting RSI levels and labeling prior cycle lows. “Here you are witnessing an opportunity that only comes around once every 12 years,” the trader wrote. “Over the past 12 years (2014–2026), Dogecoin’s RSI has dropped this low only 4 times. Every single one was an epic buying opportunity.” The post describes those four moments as a sequence of cycle bottoms, including an “all-time low” first cycle bottom, a “cycle bottom + COVID crash,” a “last cycle bottom,” and “RIGHT NOW!” Cryptollica concluded with a blunt decision frame: “Math or emotions — which one decides for you?” While neither post includes an explicit price target, the analyst said in early December that he expects Dogecoin to reach $1.30 over the medium term, citing a parallel channel top on the 3-day DOGE/USD chart. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12581. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Bitcoin pulls back to $91K – Spot buyers quietly take control

Bitcoin demand continues to build, supported by clear signs of underlying momentum rather than speculative excess. Bitcoin [BTC] has slipped back to the $91,000 zone after failing to sustain a move above the $95,000 level it defended for most of the previous week. While the pullback reflects short-term exhaustion, it has not meaningfully weakened broader market participation. Activity among Spot buyers and institutions suggests demand remains intact, providing a potential base for recovery as macro and crypto-specific developments unfold. Spot market sentiment has turned constructive for the first time in several weeks, with the Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Difference) flipping decisively positive. This metric tracks whether aggressive market activity over a defined period—typically 90 days—is dominated by buyers or sellers. A positive reading indicates that buyers are once again setting the tone. Source: CryptoQuant The shift signals a transfer of control from sellers to buyers, a development that often precedes more durable price action. Importantly, Spot-led demand points to organic accumulation rather than leverage-driven momentum, strengthening the case for medium-term upside. Exchange data reinforces this narrative. Spot exchange Netflow shows that $171.83 million worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from exchanges, reflecting sustained buying pressure. This marks a sharp reversal from the $203 million in net selling recorded in the week ending January 12. If this pace of accumulation holds, shrinking exchange balances could begin to tighten supply and support a price rebound. Institutional investors appear unfazed by recent volatility. CryptoQuant data tracking U.S.-based wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC shows steady accumulation over the past year. Over this period, institutions have absorbed approximately $53 billion worth of Bitcoin, equivalent to around 577,000 BTC. On a monthly basis, this translates to average purchases of $4.4 billion. Source: CryproQuant These inflows are largely driven by U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, backed by major asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity. AMBCrypto’s review of ETF flows shows that $1.21 billion worth of Bitcoin has already been purchased in January. Based on historical averages, additional inflows of up to $3.19 billion remain possible before month-end. That said, these figures remain conditional. Institutional positioning will continue to hinge on broader risk sentiment and macroeconomic signals. Bitcoin’s long-term relationship with global liquidity continues to favor higher prices. Historically, Bitcoin has topped out when global M2 money supply growth exceeds 14.4 percent. At present, global M2 growth sits near 11 percent, suggesting liquidity conditions remain supportive and have not yet reached levels typically associated with cycle peaks. Source: Alphractal Still, macro risks remain in focus. Farzam Ehsani, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange VALR, warned that renewed U.S.-EU tariff tensions could pressure risk assets, including Bitcoin. Ehsani said in an email to AMBCrypto. “President Trump’s aggressive trade rhetoric is pushing markets back into a full de-risking phase.” He added that the tariff dispute has weighed on cryptocurrencies primarily because they are treated as risk assets rather than due to market-specific weakness. “While U.S.-EU trade concerns have weighed most heavily on sentiment, other risk assets such as the KOSPI are trading flat or higher. This points to crypto-specific caution, with capital rotating toward alternative risk markets,” he noted. For now, institutional accumulation and Spot demand provide constructive signals, but tariff developments remain a key variable that could shape near-term market direction.

Title: Apple set to sell millions of $2,000 foldable iPhones in 2026, Citi says

Update font size. Reset Apple could be on the verge of its most transformative iPhone release in years. According to a new note from Citi analyst Atif Malik, the tech giant is poised to launch its first foldable iPhone later in 2026 — likely debuting alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max models at Apple’s annual fall event — with shipments ramping up quickly thereafter. Priced at a premium of around $2,000, the device is expected to see limited initial volume of approximately 8 million units in 2026 (roughly 3% of total iPhone shipments), before accelerating to 20 million units in 2027. Brian Sozzi for Yahoo Finance: ‎ The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on Apple — about 50% of Wall Street analysts rate Apple a Buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. He did cut his price target to $315 from $330, citing margin risk from the surge in memory chip prices. Shares of Apple have lagged the S&P 500 over the past year, gaining 11% compared to a 15% advance for the S&P 500. The stock isn’t faring any better to kick off 2026, either — shares are down 6%, tying with Meta (META) for the worst-performing member of the Magnificent Seven. But Apple may be poised to improve the narrative on the stock. For one, Apple just inked an important deal with Google, where Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology will power the next generation of the smartphone maker’s AI for Siri. While some experts say the deal is an admission that Apple is well behind in the AI race, others would counter at least Apple is now in the game. Secondarily, a long-rumored foldable iPhone would create a fresh reason for people to finally upgrade from prior iPhone iterations. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Apple won’t be able to make enough foldable iPhones to satisfy demand well into 2027. As BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a recent note to clients, “Upcoming catalysts include launch of a foldable iPhone in the fall and the launch of an enhanced Siri with integration with Gemini AI which can drive higher upgrades.” ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Did BlackRock Make A Billion-Dollar XRP Bet? Here’s The Real Tea
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-billion-dollar-xrp-bet/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T23:00:49Z

Rumors of a large-scale XRP purchase by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have captured the attention of the crypto world this week. Screenshots circulating on X suggest that the global investment company had invested over a billion dollars in the altcoin, sparking both bullish excitement and skepticism across the crypto community. The frenzy began when several popular crypto influencers, including The Crypto Bull, shared a post and portfolio screenshot claiming that BlackRock had added $1.85 billion worth of XRP to its already substantial crypto holdings. Given BlackRock’s significant influence in the crypto space, the idea that the asset manager had invested in XRP seemed like a major signal for institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. The rumors triggered a wave of speculation about the token, with some market participants viewing the alleged purchase as extremely bullish. A closer examination of BlackRock’s actual portfolio, however, shows that the reports were unfounded and lacked any evidence to support them. Data from Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company, revealed that, contrary to expectations, BlackRock holds just 5.267 XRP, valued at just $10.32—a far cry from the acclaimed $1.85 billion in holdings. The data also showed that the asset manager held the majority of its holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock’s total crypto portfolio is estimated at $82.1 billion, including 784,424 BTC valued at $71.31 billion, 3.494 million ETH worth approximately $10.8 billion, and other assets. Investigations also revealed that the original screenshots, which showed BlackRock owning 911.76 million XRP, had been edited to exaggerate the asset manager’s holdings. This misrepresentation created a temporary buzz, but did not reflect any real investment in the altcoin by the firm. Despite the false alarm, the incident highlights how quickly misinformation can spread in the crypto space, especially when shared by crypto influencers with thousands of followers. The Crypto Bull’s post drew a variety of reactions from the community. Some questioned why XRP’s price had not moved if the reports were accurate, while others remained skeptical, and a few outrightly dismissed the claims. False rumors have become a recurrent theme in the crypto world, and the latest incident with XRP and BlackRock is just one example. This is alson’t the first time false claims have been made about the token. Earlier this month, rumours of a potential Ripple partnership with Amazon spread across the community, sparking speculation about how such a collaboration could positively impact XRP’s price. Similarly, overly optimistic price forecasts can also contribute to misinformation. Some analysts have predicted that XRP could surge to $50,000, fueling unrealistic expectations for investors. In a market predominantly driven by speculation and volatility, it’s important for investors to verify sources and avoid making decisions based on unproven claims.

Some economists and experts say that critical thinking and creativity will be more important than ever in the age of artificial intelligence, when a robot can do much of the heavy lifting in coding or research. Take Benjamin Shiller, the Brandeis economics professor who recently told Fortune that a “weirdness premium” will be valued in the labor market of the future. Alex Karp, the Palantir cofounder and CEO, isn’t one of these voices. “It will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said when asked how AI will affect jobs in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy—I’ll use myself as an example—hopefully, you have some other skill, that one is going to be hard to market.” Karp attended Haverford College, a small, elite liberal arts college outside his hometown of Philadelphia. He earned a JD from Stanford Law School and a PhD in philosophy from Goethe University in Germany. He spoke about his own experience getting his first job. Of his own career, Karp told Fink that he remembered thinking: “I’m not sure who’s going to give me my first job.” The answer echoed past comments Karp has made about certain types of elite college graduates who lack specialized skills. “If you are the kind of person that would’ve gone to Yale, classically high IQ, and you have generalized knowledge but it’s not specific, you’re effed,” Karp said in an interview with Axios in November. Not every CEO agrees with Karp’s assessment that humanities graduates are doomed. BlackRock COO Robert Goldstein told Fortune in 2024 that the company was recruiting graduates who studied “things that have nothing to do with finance or technology.” McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels recently said in an interview with Harvard Business Review that the company is “looking more at liberal arts majors, whom we had deprioritized, as potential sources of creativity,” to break out of AI’s linear problem-solving. Karp has long been an advocate of vocational training over traditional college degrees. Last year, Palantir launched a Meritocracy Fellowship, offering high school students a paid internship with the chance to interview for a full-time position at the end of four months. The company criticized American universities for “indoctrinating” students and having “opaque” admissions that “displaced meritocracy and excellence,” in their announcement of the fellowship. “If you did not go to school, or you went to a school that’s not that great, or you went to Harvard or Princeton or Yale, once you come to Palantir, you’re a Palantirian—no one cares about the other stuff,” Karp said during a Q2 earnings call last year. “I think we need different ways of testing aptitude,” Karp told Fink. He pointed to the former police officer who attended a junior college, who now manages the U.S. Army’s Maven system, a Palantir-made AI tool that processes drone imagery and video. “In the past, the way we tested for aptitude would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person’s talents are,” he said. Karp also gave the example of technicians building batteries at a battery company, saying those workers are “very valuable if not irreplaceable because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly.” He said what he does all day at Palantir is “figuring out what is someone’s outlier aptitude. Then I’m putting them on that thing and trying to get them to stay on that thing and not on the five other things they think they’re great at.” Karp’s comments come as more employers report a gap between the skills applicants are offering and what employers are looking for in a tough labor market. The unemployment rate for young workers ages 16 to 24 hit 10.4% in December and is growing among college graduates. Karp isn’t too worried, though. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” he said.

The company is making that possible by adding the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index as an option in its fixed index annuity, or FIA, portfolio. An FIA is a type of insurance contract designed to provide principal protection with the potential for limited upside growth. The principal is comprised of the payments made to an insurance company. In return, the insurer promises to protect that principal against market declines. And while the gains are linked to an index—usually something like the S&P 500—the policyholder isn't directly invested in the market. So that means returns are typically capped. And if the index goes down, then the policy holder's return for that period would typically be zero instead of negative. This means that the Bitcoin exposure for Delaware Life Insurance Company policyholders will be indirect, since it's access through an ETF inside the index. "As the retirement-planning landscape evolves, we're continuously and thoughtfully innovating to meet the needs of financial professionals and their clients" Colin Lake, president and CEO of Delaware Life marketing, said in a press release. The BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index combines U.S. stocks and Bitcoin and targets 12% volatility. It uses cash adjustments to help offset Bitcoin's price swings. The Bitcoin component comes in with the iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which had amassed $74.5 billion worth of assets under management by the end of last week. The new index option will be available to policyholders for three of Delaware Life's products: Momentum Growth, Momentum Growth Plus, and DualTrack Income. Since Bitcoin ETFs launched in the U.S. two years ago, Wall Street has found lots of ways to incorporate them. Jefferies issued the first U.S. structured note tied to a Bitcoin ETF in July last year, and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan have now sold more than $530 million in structured notes linked to IBIT. Life insurance companies have been slow to embrace Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs because of market volatility. Up until now, the interest has been more in using blockchain to streamline back office functions. For example, the Bank of China put 4 million insurance records on a private blockchain in 2019. But the rate of investment in crypto product from insurers took a while to catch on. By 2021, U.S. insurers had invested only $3 million in Grayscale's Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts—before either had been converted into spot ETFs. Late last year, Morgan Stanley broadened crypto exposure for its wealth clients, including those with retirement accounts.

Title: Palantir CEO Says AI Will Somehow Be So Great That People Will Stop Immigrating

Reading time 3 minutes When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. All Palantir CEO Alex Karp has is AI, and boy, is he ready to nail some things down with it. During an appearance at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Karp sat down with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to create a nightmare blunt rotation: two guys who are heavily invested in the military industrial complex and surveillance industry, talking about how great those things are for society. Karp, as he is wont to do lately, made some outlandish statements throughout the half-hour conversation, but perhaps none more eye-popping than his barely complete thought that AI will create so many jobs that there will basically be no reason for anyone to ever immigrate to another country. Asked if AI will destroy or create jobs, Karp started answering the question in a roundabout ramble about how white-collar jobs will get hit, and vocational jobs will thrive. Then, after stating, “Not to diverge into one of my political screeds,” he proceeded to diverge into one of his political screeds. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training. I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill,” he said. There are, of course, many reasons that people leave their home country to try to start a life somewhere else, other than job seeking; from political instability and war to environmental dangers (*cough AI*). And there are, of course, many reasons that a country might want to accept immigrants other than the fact that they could contribute to the economyâlike, for instance, believing it a moral imperative to accept people fleeing from political persecution, especially when it was American meddling in foreign affairs that greatly contributed to that instability in the first place. Karp, who at least managed to stay in his seat for the majority of the interview this time, had a lot to say about a lot of things, most seemingly unconnected from whatever the original prompt was. In response to a question about whether the future will require fewer white-collar workers, he somehow landed on his engineers recommending that he stop speaking in public. Obviously, he didn’t take that advice. The incoherence was on full display throughout, with strange asides about how, despite his seeming distaste for higher education, he dreams of going back to grad schoolâbut not for the education, just for the “fun.” At one point, he noted that one of the heads of Palantir’s Maven system, an AI tool meant to be used on the battlefield by the US Army, only completed junior college and declared that he probably didn’t even need that. “Would they been as talented if they had not gone to their college? Yes,” he said, as if whatever talent or intelligence the person has is simply inherent. Maybe Karp believes he truly didn’t pick up any skills through university and was not in any way influenced in how to think, communicate, or understand the world, and he would have come out exactly the same as he is now without setting foot in school. Given that he has a PhD in philosophy, it probably says more about him than his education if he went through all of that coursework without ever challenging his own beliefs. Trying to piece together Karp’s ideas and ideology is a fool’s errand. The thing that seems like he most clearly believes is that he should be successful and rich, and the world should go along with what leads to that outcome.

Title: Strategy just crossed 700k BTC but its “circular” Bitcoin funding loop risks a massive high-yield credit disaster

With its Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, Strategy attracts income tourists, including high-profile institutional investors like BlackRock. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired an additional 22,305 Bitcoin for approximately $2.13 billion between Jan. 12 and Jan. 19, continuing an aggressive accumulation campaign that has absorbed 3.38% of the top crypto's total supply. That works out to 3.55% of the circulating supply of 19.97 million coins. The purchases were executed at an average price of $95,284 per bitcoin, according to a Jan. 20 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latest acquisition brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 709,715 BTC, a hoard worth roughly $64 billion. The company’s cost basis for the total stack is approximately $53.92 billion, or an average of $75,979 per bitcoin, implying around $10.5 billion in paper gains at current prices. The strategy that transformed MicroStrategy into a corporate Bitcoin giant appears to be hindering its S&P 500 aspirations as market skepticism fuels stock volatility. While the headline number highlights the company’s relentless buying, the mechanics behind the purchase reveal a significant shift in how Strategy funds its operations. These latest acquisitions were funded using proceeds from the firm's at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock (MSTR), its perpetual Stretch preferred stock (STRC), and the Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK). According to the SEC filing, the Michael Saylor-led Strategy sold 10,399,650 MSTR shares for approximately $1.8 billion last week. It still has about $8.4 billion worth of shares to fund future BTC purchases. However, the preferred channel is seeing increased activity. The filing showed Strategy sold 2,945,371 STRC shares for around $294.3 million (with $3.6 billion shares remaining) and 38,796 STRK shares for $3.4 million (with $20.3 billion shares remaining). This increased bet shows that the company's attempt to turn its bitcoin treasury strategy into a repeatable “yield SKU” that can sit quietly in brokerage accounts and income portfolios is yielding significant interest. Notably, this financial engineering has produced four distinct exposure tiers that trade on the Nasdaq exchange. This means investors do not need any BTC know-how to invest, as they can simply buy them through a regular brokerage account. The product lineup is segmented by risk appetite, offering four distinct ways to play the Strategy trade. The headline act is the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, or STRC. Marketed explicitly as “short duration high yield credit,” this security currently pays an 11.00% annual dividend in monthly cash installments. Strategy expands its Bitcoin-linked securities, offering innovative options for income-seeking investors to potentially outpace inflation. Unlike a standard bond where market forces dictate the yield, STRC is an issuer-managed product. Strategy retains the policy power to adjust the dividend rate to ensure the stock trades near its $100 par value. Data from STRC.live shows that the firm has accumulated 27,000 BTC from the STRC fundraiser. Below STRC sits a tiered structure of fixed-rate perpetuals. For the investor who wants a piece of the equity upside, there is STRK (“Strike”). It pays an 8% annual dividend and is non-cumulative (meaning missed payments are lost forever). However, it functions as a hybrid, offering convertibility to stock that captures about 40% of the gains if Strategy’s common shares rally. For the risk-averse income seeker, the company offers STRF (“Strife”). This 10% perpetual preferred cannot be converted to stock, but it sits higher in the capital structure. It is cumulative, meaning the company must make up any missed dividend payments later. With $1.6 billion remaining in capacity, it represents the most conservative tier. Crypto analysts liken Strategy's risky dividend plan to historical hedge fund calamities, raising alarms. There is also the STRD (“Stride”) instrument, which matches the 10% yield of STRF but removes the safety net. It is non-cumulative and non-convertible. If Strategy skips a payment, the investor has no recourse, giving STRD the sharpest risk-reward profile among the fixed-rate options. It has $1.4 billion remaining. Meanwhile, the company has even opened a European front. Last November, Strategy introduced the Series A Perpetual Stream Preferred (STRE), a euro-denominated security that carries a 10% annual dividend paid quarterly. This instrument carries sharp teeth regarding non-payment. The dividend is cumulative and increases by 100 basis points per missed period, up to a maximum of 18%. Strategy's financial engineering product list has successfully courted a demographic that typically shuns crypto: the income tourist. Data from several institutional filings show that high-income and preferred-focused funds are populating the STRC holders list. The roster includes the Fidelity Capital & Income Fund (FAGIX), Fidelity Advisor Floating Rate High Income (FFRAX), and the Virtus InfraCap U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFFA). Meanwhile, the most striking validation comes from BlackRock. The BlackRock iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) is a massive fund that tracks an index usually dominated by sleepy bank and utility preferreds. As of Jan. 16, the fund held $14.25 billion in net assets. Inside that conservative portfolio, Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked paper has established a beachhead. The ETF disclosed a position of approximately $210 million in Strategy’s STRC. It holds another ~$260 million across STRF, STRK, and STRD. In total, BlackRock’s ETF exposure to Strategy preferreds sits at roughly $470 million (or 3.3% of the total fund). Valentin Kosanovic, a deputy director at Capital B, views this as a watershed moment for digital credit. According to him: “This is another clear, factual, unquestionable demonstration of the materialization of the wave of institutionalized legacy BTC-pegged financial products.” The machinery required to sustain these dividends creates a unique set of risks. Strategy is not paying these yields from operating profits in the traditional sense. It is funding them through the capital markets. The company’s prospectus for STRC states that cash dividends are expected to be funded primarily through additional capital raising, including at-the-market stock offerings. This creates a circular dependency: Strategy sells securities to buy Bitcoin and then pays dividends on those securities. Considering this, Michael Fanelli, a partner at RSM US, highlighted several risks associated with this model, including Bitcoin price crashes, the lack of insurance coverage, and the fact that the products are unproven in recessions. He also noted that the perpetual products have no maturity date. However, Bitcoin analyst Adam Livingston countered that the products are a “mind-bender” for traditional analysts. He argued that “STRC is quietly turning Strategy into a private central bank for the yield-starved world.” According to him: “STRC is a coupon-bearing ‘credit rail’ that can absorb fixed-income demand, convert it into BTC at scale, then feed the equity premium that makes the next raise easier, cheaper, and faster. That is a flywheel with a bid inside it.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. European leaders eye U.S. Treasurys as Greenland leverage, risking a one-month yield shock on Americans. As 40-year yields skyrocket past 4%, the sudden evaporation of cheap yen is forcing a messy global reset. NYSE is moving to "continuous" settlement, leaving traditional banking hours in the dust forever. Bitcoin stability is under threat as a diverging "protein stress ratio" reveals hidden economic risks most experts are missing. Card fees can hit 3.5%, but without smooth on-ramps, off-ramps, and compliance, “cheap settlement” stays theoretical.

Title: Bitcoin enters Delaware Life’s retirement annuity portfolio

The product gives retirement investors indirect Bitcoin exposure through a BlackRock index built on the company's spot Bitcoin ETF. Cointelegraph in your social feed Delaware Life Insurance Company is adding limited Bitcoin-linked exposure to its retirement annuity portfolio through an index developed by BlackRock. The insurer will offer an index that blends US stocks with a small, risk-managed allocation to Bitcoin (BTC). The Bitcoin exposure comes through BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, meaning investors do not hold Bitcoin directly. The index combines US equities with managed BTC exposure and applies volatility controls designed to limit fluctuations to about 12%. Delaware Life said the structure allows policyholders to gain indirect exposure to BTC price movements while still preserving their principal under the annuity’s terms. The index will be available across three of Delaware Life’s fixed indexed annuity products. Fixed indexed annuities are insurance-based retirement products that protect the initial investment and offer tax-deferred growth, with returns tied to the performance of a referenced market index rather than direct asset ownership. Delaware Life Insurance Company is a US life insurance and annuity provider focused on retirement products. The company said it surpassed $40 billion in cumulative annuity sales as of November 2025. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, launched its Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. According to CoinMarketCap data, the fund has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, making it the largest spot Bitcoin fund. In December, BlackRock said the ETF ranked among the company’s three largest investment themes in 2025. Related: Crypto industry, trade unions clash over multi-trillion dollar retirement funds The Delaware Life product is not the only example of insurance companies experimenting with Bitcoin-linked structures. Meanwhile Group, a company that offers Bitcoin life insurance, launched in June 2023 backed by investors including Sam Altman and Gradient Ventures. In October 2025, the company raised $82 million in a funding round, which it said would be used to support growing demand for Bitcoin-denominated retirement and savings products. Tabit, a Barbados-based insurer, has taken a different approach by using Bitcoin to fund its balance sheet rather than offering crypto-linked insurance products. In March, the company raised $40 million in Bitcoin to back traditional US dollar-denominated property and casualty insurance policies, saying its entire regulatory reserve was held in Bitcoin. Beyond insurance products, US policymakers have moved to expand access to crypto exposure through other retirement vehicles. In August, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing US regulators to expand access to cryptocurrency in 401(k) retirement plans.

Title: Billionaires Gather To Tell World No One Likes Them, But To Please Come Back, They Miss Us

Full Content:
It’s that time of year again. All the billionaires, technocrats, and corporate media shills are gathering in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to ask why everyone else in the world despises them. For example, does it ever occur to them that flying private jets into the Swiss ski town, while insisting that the rest of us make consumption changes to fight climate change, is a tremendously stupid display of hypocrisy that will only further erode trust in institutions? (RELATED: Lower-Caste Davos Attendees Left Stranded In Cold During Fyre Fest Of The Alps) Take BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who controls the world’s largest asset management company. Fink is a Davos man, par excellence. He knows why everyone hates the WEF and the 850 CEOs and 65 heads of state who attended, yet still isn’t willing to give it up. France’s President Emmanuel Macron (R) gestures as he speaks next to BlackRock chairman and WEF co-chairman Larry Fink during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 20, 2026. The World Economic Forum takes place in Davos from January 19 to January 23, 2026. (Photo by Ludovic MARIN / AFP via Getty Images) Fink acknowledged the deep distrust surrounding the World Economic Forum (WEF), stating Tuesday that for many the annual Davos meeting “feels out of step with the moment: elites in an age of populism, an established institution in an era of deep institutional distrust.” He admitted there is “truth in that critique,” and that the world now “places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next.” He then insisted he would not lead the WEF if he didn’t believe in its potential, but stressed that for it to be “useful going forward, it has to regain that trust.” He conceded that a major failure of the Davos attendees has been their inability to listen to those left behind by globalization. Adding to this concern, the BlackRock CEO warned that Artificial Intelligence “threatens to replay the same pattern,” potentially putting millions out of work while the gains flow “to the owners of models, data, and infrastructure.” The observation is particularly salient considering BlackRock itself is a significant investor in AI data centers and infrastructure. This photograph taken on January 20, 2026 shows a general view of the town of Davos at nightfall during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos. The World Economic Forum takes place in Davos from January 19 to January 23, 2026. (Photo by INA FASSBENDER / AFP via Getty Images) The decline of public trust stems from fundamental issues that Fink failed to address, such as the total financialization of the economy, the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, forever wars, and corporate bailouts. Rebuilding trust will not be achieved through more WEF gatherings, cheap rhetoric, non-profits, or data sheets. Instead, trust can only be restored when leaders are held accountable for the detrimental policies they impose on the public. It requires high-profile climate activists to stop using private jets and demands that those at the top have skin in the game. If you’re a billionaire who’s worried about carbon emissions, book your next flight on economy with the rest of us proles. Without skin in the game and real consequences for those in power, institutions — including governments, banks, and universities — will continue to exploit the average citizen across the globe, not just in this decade, but in decades to come.

Title: Stewart Brand – Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One
URL: https://press.stripe.com/maintenance-part-one
Time Published: 2026-01-20T19:01:30Z
Full Content:
The first in a multi-volume work, Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One offers a comprehensive overview of the civilizational importance of maintenance. The book explores the insights that can be gleaned from the maintenance of sailboats, vehicles, and weapons, with absorbing detours into the evolution of precision in manufacturing, the enduring importance of manuals, sustainment in the military, and the never-ending battle against corrosion. Maintenance: Of Everything is a wide-ranging and provocative call to expand what we mean by “maintenance.” It invites us to understand not only the profound impact maintenance has on our daily lives but also why taking responsibility for maintaining something—whether a motorcycle, a monument, or our planet—can be a radical act. Stewart Brand is the cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation. He created and edited the National Book Award-winning Whole Earth Catalog from 1968 to 1998. His books include The Media Lab (1987), How Buildings Learn (1994), The Clock of the Long Now (1999), and Whole Earth Discipline (2009). He was the subject of the documentary We Are As Gods (2020). Stewart Brand makes a persuasive case that keeping the human show on the road through well-planned maintenance is as vital and as fascinating a task as innovation and discovery themselves. A deliciously good book. Matt Ridley author of The Rational Optimist Once again, Stewart Brand reframes our worldview with a new perspective. You may not imagine you would be interested in rust, Soviet tanks, or tricked-out Model Ts—that is, until Brand reexamines them through the lens of maintenance. Maintenance: Of Everything is destined to be a classic. Danny Hillis cofounder of Applied Invention Stewart Brand is back with a manifesto on maintenance, the tool that empowers all tools. Preventative maintenance, deferred maintenance, and emergency maintenance: this much-needed, no-nonsense treatise illuminates the difference, and why it counts. George Dyson author of Darwin Among the Machines and Turing’s Cathedral Civilization is maintenance. No one else but Stewart Brand is talking about the art and science of maintenance and how to do it well. This will be an instant classic. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brand masterfully takes us on a journey through the world of the fixers keeping the gears of civilization rolling. If you’re the kind of person who wants to know why things break and how to stop it, you should read this book. Kyle Wiens CEO of iFixit What a splendid book to read while fixing an old house. I stopped moaning and whining and became a quiet hero of relentless “sustainment.” Bruce Sterling author and editor of Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology Maintenance is interesting in more ways than I can count. I felt smarter for having read this book and lucky for being alive at a time when Stewart Brand is writing it. Charles C. Mann author of 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus In his fresh and inimitable prose, Stewart Brand makes a striking case for what he calls maintenance–the upkeep of the things that make modern life possible. Back to the basics of caring and repairing–sailing boats, automobiles, sewing machines, Colt revolvers, bicycles and even tanks in the Yom Kippur war–Brand shows us why know-how and understanding how machines work really matter. New things get our attention but mastering how to take care of things we already have is life work that counts like no other. This book is Stewart Brand at his best. Jerry Brown former Governor of California A new classic — original and fresh, smart, wise, a universal topic, Stewart makes me so happy once again. Edward Tufte statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University Efficiency is the engine of civilization. But where do improvements in production efficiency come from? In The Origins of Efficiency, Brian Potter argues that improving production efficiency—finding ways to produce goods and services in less time, with less labor, using fewer resources—is the force behind some of the most consequential changes in human history. He examines the fundamental characteristics of a production process and how each can be made faster, cheaper, and more reliable, with detailed examples from a range of industries: steel and semiconductors, wind turbines and container shipping, Tesla and the Ford Model T, and more. The Origins of Efficiency is a comprehensive companion for anyone seeking to understand how we arrived at this age of material abundance—and how we can push efficiency improvements into domains like housing, medicine, and education, where much work is left to be done. Brian Potter is the author of the Construction Physics newsletter and a senior infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress. He previously managed an engineering team at Katerra, a SoftBank-backed construction startup, and has 15 years of experience as a structural engineer. Brilliant and comprehensive. Brian Potter is the single best writer in America on how important things get built, and his new book is the single best example of his work. Derek Thompson author of Hit Makers and coauthor of Abundance A whole-systems overview of all known manufacturing processes (past and present), crammed with dense details, stories, anecdotes, and lessons from the front lines… If you have any interest in, or responsibility for, how to make stuff at scale, you need to read this book. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brian Potter does impeccable, detailed research that he turns into clairvoyant insight about civilization’s most arcane processes. Here, he examines the mechanisms that enable spectacular efficiency in the production of goods and services. Stewart Brand cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation America has forgotten how to make things. Brian Potter is here to help us remember. By the time you finish this book, you’ll feel like you’re well on your way to becoming an expert in manufacturing. Noah Smith author of Noahpinion How did we build large language models? How do they think, if they think? What will the world look like if we have billions of AIs that are as smart as humans, or even smarter? In a series of in-depth interviews with leading AI researchers and company founders—including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, DeepMind cofounder Demis Hassabis, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, MIRI cofounder Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—Dwarkesh Patel provides the first comprehensive and contemporary portrait of the technology that is transforming our world. Drawn from his interviews on the Dwarkesh Podcast, these curated excerpts range from the technical details of how LLMs work to the possibility of an AI takeover or explosive economic growth. It also includes 170+ definitions and visualizations, classic essays on the theme, and previously unpublished interviews. The Scaling Era offers readers unprecedented insight into a transformative moment in AI’s development—and a vision of what comes next. Dwarkesh Patel is the host of Dwarkesh Podcast, where he produces deeply researched interviews with both obscure intellectuals and the most influential figures of our time. Gavin Leech is the cofounder of Arb Research, a consultancy that does empirical and conceptual work in various sciences. He has a PhD in AI.

Jeff Dean chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research There’s only one test relevant for an artifact about AI: Would you learn more from reading it than you would from using a newly released LLM for the equivalent amount of time? The Scaling Era handily passes. Patrick McKenzie author of Bits About Money and host of Complex Systems Dwarkesh’s interviews are full of quotes that will be in history books. Byrne Hobart investor, consultant, and author of The Diff and Boom From the Moon landing to the dawning of the atomic age, the decades prior to the 1970s were characterized by the routine invention of transformative technologies at breakneck speed. By comparison, ours is an age of stagnation; of slowing median wage growth, rising inequality, and decelerated scientific discovery. In Boom, Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber take an inductive approach to this problem. They track some of the most significant breakthroughs of the past 100 years—from the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program to Moore’s law and Bitcoin—and reverse-engineer how transformative progress arises from the same dynamics that govern financial bubbles, bringing together small groups with a unified vision, vast funding, and surprisingly poor accountability. Bubbles, they conclude, aren’t all bad—in fact, they create the ideal conditions for transformative innovation. Integrating insights from economics, philosophy, and history, Boom provides a blueprint for accelerating innovation and a path to unleash a new era of global prosperity. Byrne Hobart is an investor, consultant, and writer. He is the author of The Diff, a daily newsletter covering inflection points in finance and technology. He is also a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. Tobias Huber is a writer and investor. He is a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. He has a background in philosophy and holds a doctor of science degree from ETH Zurich. The dot-com bubble looked like the peak of delusion, but the truly deluded were those who wanted to indefinitely defer the future. Everyone knows bubbles can disguise madness as wisdom; read this book for the alternative history of our age. Peter Thiel investor and author of Zero to One Boom makes the case that humanity’s greatest risk is not climate change or misaligned superintelligent Al but not making enough progress. A must-read for those who seek to build the future. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz When is it that temporary bubbles can help drive forward progress? This happened with the railroads, with the internet, and it is likely to happen with AI. Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber have produced some essential reading on a very important and also understudied topic. Tyler Cowen author of The Great Stagnation and professor of economics at George Mason University “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up,” Charlie Munger advises in Poor Charlie’s Almanack. Originally published in 2005, this compilation of 11 talks by the legendary Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman has become a touchstone for a generation of investors and entrepreneurs. Delivered with Munger’s characteristic rhetorical flair, Poor Charlie’s Almanack draws on his encyclopedic knowledge of business, finance, history, philosophy, physics, and ethics to introduce the latticework of mental models that underpin his rational and rigorous approach to life, learning, and decision-making. It is an essential volume for any reader seeking to go to bed a little wiser than when they woke up. This abridged edition features a new foreword by Stripe cofounder and president John Collison. Charles T. Munger (1924–2023) was an investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He was the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett. He was chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 to 2011. He was also chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.Peter D. Kaufman is the chairman and CEO of Glenair, Inc. He was a longtime director of Wesco Financial Corporation and is a former director of Daily Journal Corporation. In 2005, he edited and published Poor Charlie’s Almanack, a compilation of talks given by his longtime friend Charlie Munger. This book is something of a publishing miracle—never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its internet site. Warren Buffett CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger was born before corporate speak, before business leaders minced words to obscure truths. But Charlie Munger’s words have always cut like a knife—and that sharp spirit of truth-seeking built Berkshire into what it is today. We should all aspire to such clarity. Katherine Boyle general partner at a16z Poor Charlie’s Almanack is a timeless classic that will change how you approach life. There is a billion-dollar education inside this book. Shane Parrish founder of Syrus Partners and Farnam Street This book is the best way to learn from Munger and his ideas. It’s a must-read for anyone interested in thinking clearly, rationally, and effectively. Ana Lorena Fabrega author, educator, and chief evangelist at Synthesis Charlie Munger’s insights are timeless. Some of these speeches were delivered over 20 years ago, but they feel like they could have been given yesterday. Tyler Hogge venture partner at Pelion If I could only read one book to help me succeed in life and business, this is the book I’d read. Charlie’s timeless wisdom has inspired millions and will continue to resonate for generations to come.

Jason Citron founder and CEO of Discord In Pieces of the Action, Vannevar Bush—engineer, inventor, educator, and public face of government-funded science—offers an inside account of one of the most innovative research and development ecosystems of the 20th century. As the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II, he was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuze, the mass production of penicillin, and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Pieces of the Action offers his hard-won lessons on how to operate and manage effectively within complex organizations, build bridges between people and disciplines, and drive ambitious, unprecedented programs to fruition. Originally published in 1970, this updated edition includes a foreword from Ben Reinhardt that contextualizes the lessons Pieces of the Action can offer to contemporary readers: that change depends both on heroic individuals and effective organizations; that a leader’s job is one of coordination; and that the path from idea to innovation is a long and winding one, inextricably bound to those involved—those enduring figures who have a piece of the action. Vannevar Bush (1890–1974) was an engineer, inventor, educator, and architect of public-sector funding for scientific research in the United States. During World War II, he oversaw a wide-ranging R&D program that paired government funding with scientific research, resulting in the development of radar and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Outside of government, he conducted foundational research in computer science, including the invention of the differential analyzer. His 1945 essay “As We May Think” is credited with anticipating aspects of personal computing and the internet, while his government report Science, The Endless Frontier laid the groundwork for the founding of the National Science Foundation. Both are considered seminal texts that have inspired successive generations of scientists and engineers. Pieces of the Action is not just about science and innovation, it’s about state capacity. Anyone who longs for renewed, effective institutions will find the wisdom of a kindred spirit reflecting on how to build them. Eli Dourado economist and senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University Pieces of the Action provides a window into the way Bush saw himself: as part of a larger cultural tradition, equipping new generations with knowledge from past ones. I came away encouraged and inspired by the knowledge that great things can be built in spite of stagnation, rigid norms, and conventions, through the determination and foresight of people who work to change institutions—and build new ones, too. Saloni Dattani cofounder and editor of Works in Progress and researcher at Our World in Data Scientific and technological progress depend crucially on leadership. Bush understood this better than anyone, and he had a front-row seat to the most important R&D work of the 20th century. This candid memoir gave me a better understanding of how research leadership works and why it’s desperately needed. Jason Crawford writer at The Roots of Progress It’s hard to deny that Vannevar Bush was at the nexus of an astounding number of people and events that shaped the modern world. In Pieces of the Action, he works hard to give us a window into his thought processes, and from them distill timeless lessons about leadership, research, institution building, and human nature. Ben Reinhardt CEO of PARPA, researcher at the Astera Institute, and host of the Idea Machines podcast Pieces of the Action catalogs the scientists and engineers who were pivotal to an Allied victory in World War II—and how the ad-hoc organizations born out of that crisis ultimately provided the blueprints for our modern scientific institutions. If you want to understand the ‘man in the arena’ at the center of it all, this discursive, blunt, and often funny memoir is the best place to start. Alec Stapp cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress Pieces of the Action is an often-whimsical ride through time and the mind of the man whose insight, strategic instincts, and institutional empire-building formed the basis of the modern scientific state. One comes away with a view of scientific development that is anything but linear: the gravitational weight of historical contingencies, idiosyncratic personnel, and key management decisions described in Pieces of the Action continue to profoundly impact us today. Caleb Watney cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress In Where Is My Flying Car?, engineer and futurist J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer the deceptively simple question posed in the book’s title. What starts as an exploration of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an examination of the global economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion and nanotechnology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. Hall then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress—one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. J. Storrs Hall, Ph.D., is an independent scientist and author. He was the founding chief scientist of Nanorex, Inc. and a president of the Foresight Institute and is currently a research fellow at the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing and an associate editor of the International Journal of Nanotechnology and Molecular Computation. He was also accredited as an expert reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the field of computational climate models. His previous books include Beyond AI: Creating the Conscience of the Machine and Nanofuture: What’s Next for Nanotechnology. Now residing on Chesapeake Bay, he dabbles in aerodynamics design under the auspices of Eastern Shore Flying Cars, LLC. There are many writers with optimistic visions of the future. However, the goals I most often hear are all the negation of negatives: cure cancer, eliminate poverty, stop climate change. . . . This is good, but it is not enough. [These techno-optimists] are content with bringing the whole world up to the current best standard of living, but not increasing it. In this context, I found Where Is My Flying Car? refreshing. Hall unabashedly calls for unlimited progress in every dimension. Jason Crawford founder and CEO of Roots of Progress One of the best and most interesting books on technology. Tyler Cowen professor of economics at George Mason University and cowriter of Marginal Revolution Whether there is ‘tech stagnation’ or a revolution about to swarm the skies, Where Is My Flying Car? offers piercing questions and answers about what it might take to make the dream come true. David Brin author of Existence and The Postman While Silicon Valley is synonymous with software, its beginnings were driven by a need for a better class of hardware. Michael S. Malone’s The Big Score is a panoramic history of Silicon Valley’s founding days—written as they were still playing out in 1985. One of the first reporters on the tech industry beat, Malone recounts the feverish efforts of technologists and entrepreneurs to build something that would change the world. Starting with the birth of the semiconductor in the 1930s, he illustrates how decades of technological innovation laid the foundation for the meteoric rise of the Valley in the 1970s. Malone punctuates this history with profiles of tech’s early builders, capturing the high-agency spirit that shaped the electronics revolution. A decades-long story with individual sacrifice and ingenuity at its core, The Big Score recounts the history of today’s most dynamic sector through its upstart beginnings. Michael S. Malone has covered Silicon Valley and tech for over 30 years. His articles and editorials have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Economist, Fortune, New York Times, and San Jose Mercury-News. He has written or co-authored more than 25 award-winning books, including Bill and Dave and The Intel Trinity, and coproduced The New Heroes, an Emmy-nominated miniseries on social entrepreneurs. He lives in Palo Alto, California. Mike Malone’s epic depiction of Silicon Valley was a calling card for me and countless other young entrepreneurs with a background in tech. Malone’s stories captured the essence of Valley culture and the many outsize personalities who helped create this mecca of tech. Years later, this book is still relevant, and offers insights into the Valley and its ongoing place in the world. Jeff Skoll first president of eBay Mike Malone is the gold standard for telling Silicon Valley’s history. He has witnessed the evolution of the Valley from fruit groves to office parks, and has catalogued the world’s dependency on the Valley’s innovative technology. Experience the growth of Silicon Valley through the eyes of a pioneer, friend, reporter, and mentor to so many of us early Valley entrepreneurs. Sandy Kurtzig founder, CEO, and chairman of ASK Group From the Valley’s deep roots in the semiconductor industry to the rise of startups and venture capital, and the emergence of new models of management, The Big Score documents the beginnings of a technological transformation. When the book was first published, the microprocessor was kick-starting the computer industry. Today, our greatest innovators continue to build on the work of these early pioneers. John Hennessy president emeritus of Stanford University and chairman, Alphabet Inc. So rich was the scientific harvest of the early 20th century that it transformed entire industries and economies. Max Planck laid the foundation for quantum physics, Barbara McClintock for modern genetics, Linus Pauling for chemistry—the list goes on. But in the 1970s, the nature and pace of scientific discovery began to stagnate due to a combination of peer review, mandated justification of spending, and the push for short-term miracles. In Scientific Freedom, first published in 2008, Donald W. Braben presents a framework to find and support transformative scientific innovation. Even in the earliest stages, groundbreaking research can look unrecognizable to those who are accustomed to the patterns established by the past. As Braben argues, support for this research requires rethinking the processes used to discover and sponsor scientists with revolutionary ideas—and then giving them the freedom to explore. Donald W. Braben is a scientist and author. From 1980 to 1990, he led British Petroleum’s Venture Research program, for which he developed a radical, low-cost approach to finding and funding researchers whose work might redefine their fields. He currently holds an honorary position at University College London. A superb book, both inspiring and provocative. Braben strives to ensure that the most creative scientists, if completely free to pursue unorthodox research, will aim to attain the ‘elixir of civilization.’ Dudley Herschbach Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1986 All scientists, granting agencies, and policymakers should read this refreshing book and respond to the need to change current funding paradigms. Sir Richard J. Roberts Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1993 Braben has long held visionary views of how to fund the most innovative and creative science. It cannot be denied that, with the right financial support, his approach can be made to work spectacularly. Sir Martyn Poliakoff University of Nottingham, Michael Faraday Prize 2019 A sobering (but hopeful!) exploration of the stagnation in what I would call ‘paradigm shifting research’ and what to do about it. Ben Reinhardt Braben does an excellent job of highlighting the need to reassess the selection criteria used to decide what scientific projects receive funding. Quarterly Review of Biology Over the last 20 years, open source software has undergone a significant shift—from providing an optimistic model for public collaboration to undergoing constant maintenance by the often unseen solo operators who write and publish the code that millions of users rely on every day. In Working in Public, Nadia Eghbal takes an inside look at modern open source software development, its evolution over the last two decades, and its ramifications for an internet reorienting itself around individual creators. By delineating the structure of open source projects, she explores, for the first time, the maintenance costs of production that software incurs for its developers. Drawing on hundreds of developer interviews and analyses of platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube, Eghbal argues that examining who produces things on the internet, and not just what they produce, helps us understand the value of online content today. Nadia Eghbal is a writer and researcher who explores how the internet enables individual creators. From 2015 to 2019, she worked independently and at GitHub to improve the open source developer experience. She is the author of “Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure,” published by the Ford Foundation. Nadia writes from a unique perspective at the intersection of open source, economics, and poetry. This is the definitive book on the dynamics of online creative communities. Nat Friedman CEO of GitHub Nadia is one of today’s most nuanced thinkers about the depth and potential of online communities. This book could not have come at a better time, as the ways we relate to each other have become more sharply mediated by the internet. Devon Zuegel former director of product for communities at GitHub In the age of information abundance, we’re all maintainers now. Working in Public is an anthropological dive into the stories of real developers, providing us a way to ask new questions through the lens of open source. Nadia presents us with a book that isn’t focused on just money, licenses, or code, but which is for all of us who make, as creators of all kinds. Henry Zhu maintainer of Babel Working in Public [is] a fascinating book . . . . We need to rethink the very idea of what crowdsourcing is capable of—and understand that it is perhaps more limited than promised. The open source revolution has been carried on the backs of some very weary people. Wired Eghbal clearly sees and articulates something important about the way we make things, and how that’s changing. . . .Working in Public opens by challenging a common perception about open source today: the idea that it’s collaborative. Alex Danco What inspires a great idea? Can we train our thinking to develop world-changing understandings and insights? Richard Hamming would say yes. In The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, he elaborates on his seminal essay “You and Your Research,” a provocative challenge to anyone who wants to build something great, and offers a manual of style for how to get there. Playfully framed as a textbook, and rich in its recounting of influential individuals like Albert Einstein and Grace Hopper, this unorthodox memoir by the seminal mathematician and engineer encourages the reader to aspire to, learn from, and surpass the achievements of yesterday’s greatest minds. This edition includes the original 1996 compilation of Hamming’s lectures for the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, along with a new foreword by designer and engineer Bret Victor and more than 70 redrawn graphs and charts. Richard W. Hamming (1915–1998) was a scientist and mathematician who discovered formulas that allow computers to correct their own errors. He provided crucial programming support to the Manhattan Project, and later joined Bell Labs. In 1968, he received the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science. Hamming is here to tell you about excellence. His lessons unfold through personal stories of discovery and failure—life as an extraordinary scientist. But Hamming demands that you do extraordinary work, too, and for that he offers the best advice I know. Andy Matuschak software engineer, designer, and researcher Hamming was always as much a teacher as a scientist, and, having spent a lifetime forming and confirming a theory of great people, he felt he could prepare the next generation for even greater greatness. That’s the premise and promise of this book. Bret Victor founder of Dynamicland Your last chance to read the thinking of one of the major intellects that the U.S.A. has produced. Eugene N. Miya NASA researcher [Hamming] was one of the last geniuses who believed in innovation as a shared public project. New Yorker, which named The Art of Doing Science and Engineering a best book of 2020 Before Prince of Persia was a bestselling video game franchise and a Disney movie, it was an Apple II computer game created and programmed by a lone developer, Jordan Mechner. Mechner’s candid and revealing journals from the time capture the journey from his parents’ basement to the forefront of the fast-growing 1980s video game industry, as a 20-year-old fresh out of college with a liberal arts degree—and the creative, technical, personal, and professional struggles that brought the Prince into the homes of millions of people worldwide. In The Making of Prince of Persia, on the 30th anniversary of the game’s release, Mechner looks back at the journals he kept from 1985 to 1993 and annotates them with insights into the game that established him as a pioneer of cinematic storytelling in the industry. Jordan Mechner is a game designer, screenwriter, and author. His other books include the sketchbook journal Year 2 in France and the Eisner Award-nominated graphic novel Templar, a New York Times bestseller illustrated by LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland. Prince of Persia was the first computer game I ever fell in love with. Mechner’s journey is a universal one for anyone creating something brand-new, and it brought me back to the early, crazy days of building Instagram. Mike Krieger cofounder of Instagram Mechner’s journals are a unique record from the birth of an industry. The Making of Prince of Persia is also an unvarnished window into the creative process, with all its excitement, toil, setbacks, doubts, and triumphs. A fantastic read. D.B. Weiss cocreator of HBO’s Game of Thrones Probably my favorite book on game development. Neil Druckmann writer and director of The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 It’s a genuinely delightful book, even if you don’t care about the history of video games. . . .To read Mechner’s contemporaneous logs of his wrestling with his tools and machines is to take a journey back to a heroic age of games authorship. Cory Doctorow The best biography I’ve ever read. Applied Divinity Studies Although communities feel magical, they don’t come together by magic. Whether starting a run crew, connecting with fans online, or sparking a movement of K-12 teachers, the secret to getting people together is to build your community with people, not for them.

Jeffrey Meyerson host of the Software Engineering Daily podcast Engineering managers can often feel like they are struggling to keep their heads above the water. Our technical training is missing the frameworks and tools needed to build healthy and productive teams. The insights and step-by-step approach covered in An Elegant Puzzle will become your favorite go-to resource. Oren Ellenbogen VP of engineering at Forter An Elegant Puzzle is to date the most hands-on perspective on engineering management within a high-growth, tech-first organization, that I have read. . . .[It] is not just for engineering managers: product managers and engineers working at high-growth companies will find it a good read. Gergely Orosz Larson captures the timeless spirit of creative problem-solving that draws us to software engineering while also providing concrete strategies for modern organizations. Software Engineering Daily When it comes to the flow of information, technology has categorically reversed the balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age—government, political parties, and the media. In The Revolt of the Public, Martin Gurri tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world. Originally published in 2014, The Revolt of the Public now appears in an updated edition, which includes an extensive analysis of Donald Trump’s improbable rise to the presidency and the electoral triumphs of Brexit. Gurri concludes with a look forward, considering whether the current elite class can bring about a reformation of the democratic process, and whether new organizing principles, adapted to a digital world, can arise out of the present political turbulence. Martin Gurri is a geopolitical analyst who specializes in the relationship between politics and global media. He spent 28 years analyzing open media at the CIA. The Revolt of the Public draws from writing on his blog, The Fifth Wave. All over the world, elite institutions, from governments to media to academia, are losing their authority and monopoly control of information to the broader public. This book has been my No. 1 handout to anyone seeking to understand this unfolding shift in power from hierarchies to networks in the age of the internet. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz Martin Gurri saw it coming. When, without fanfare, he self-published the first edition in June of 2014, he did not specifically name Donald Trump or Brexit. But he saw how the internet in general and social media in particular were transforming the political landscape. Arnold Kling economist and writer We are in an open war between publics with passionate and untutored interests and elites who believe they have the right to guide those publics. Gurri asks the essential question: Can liberal representative democracy survive the rise of the publics? Roger Berkowitz founder of the Hannah Arendt Center and professor of politics and human rights at Bard College “The internet has been a marvelous invention in lots of ways, but it has also unleashed a tsunami of misinformation and destabilized political systems across the globe. Martin Gurri . . . was way ahead of the curve on this problem. Vox Mr. Gurri writes that the internet has empowered ordinary citizens by giving them new information and tools, which they then use to discover the flaws in the systems and institutions that govern their lives. New York Times Throughout history, economic growth has alleviated human misery, improved human happiness and opportunity, expanded political rights, and lengthened human lives. If we want to prolong growth trends and the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for societies that come with them, every individual must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us. So how do we enable such altruism? In Stubborn Attachments—a culmination of 20 years of philosophical and economic thinking and research—Tyler Cowen argues that reason and common sense can help free us of the faulty ideas that hold us back as people and as a society, allowing us to set our sights on the long-term struggles that maximize sustainable economic growth while respecting human rights. At its heart, Stubborn Attachments makes the contemporary moral case for economic growth and delivers a dose of inspiration and optimism about the future. Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and director of the Mercatus Center. He was named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the past decade. He is the author of several books, including the New York Times bestseller The Great Stagnation, and is an opinion columnist at Bloomberg. He also cowrites the blog Marginal Revolution and hosts the podcast Conversations with Tyler. Most of Tyler’s books will change how you see the world in a myriad of small ways. Stubborn Attachments might well change the way you see the world in one very big way. Whether you agree or disagree with Tyler’s argument, I think you’ll find that following the logic in Stubborn Attachments is as fun as it is intellectually provocative. Cardiff Garcia cohost of the NPR podcast The Indicator from Planet Money Tyler Cowen is a national treasure, and Stubborn Attachments is brimming with deep insights–about the immense importance of economic growth, moral obligations, rights, and how to think about the future. It’s a book for right now, and a book for all times. A magnificent achievement. Cass R. Sunstein Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard and bestselling author of Nudge Tyler Cowen is one of the most intriguing and eclectic thinkers on the planet—like many people, I read something by him every day. In Stubborn Attachments, he combines economics and philosophy in a truly important achievement. His best, most ambitious, and most personal work. Tim Harford author of The Undercover Economist The thing about economic growth, Cowen tells us, is that it has the potential to advance just about everything that people value. . . .There is considerable evidence supporting the commonsense view that citizens of rich countries are happier than citizens of poor countries, and that, within rich countries, wealthier individuals are happier than poorer ones. New Yorker Stubborn Attachments is a philosophy book. . . .[Tyler] doesn’t try to set out an absolute, formalistic, fully internally consistent system of ethical principles—instead, he embraces an eclectic, often conflicting set of principles. This is refreshing, since rigid systems always prove fragile to intuitive counterexamples. Noah Smith Stubborn Attachments presents a compelling case for redefining our long-term priorities in favor of more sustained economic growth and a greater respect for human rights. Los Angeles Review of Books Behind every great revolution is a vision, and behind one of the greatest revolutions of our time—personal computing—is the vision of J. C. R. Licklider. He wasn’t an engineer and he didn’t start a company or write code; instead, he was a relentless visionary who saw great potential in the way individuals could interact with computers and software. At a time when computers were a short step removed from mechanical data processors, Licklider was an enthusiastic catalyst for the seminal research that ultimately led to the internet. In a simultaneously compelling personal narrative and comprehensive historical exposition, The Dream Machine by M. Mitchell Waldrop tells the story of the birth of the computing revolution through the life of a man who shifted our understanding of what computers were and could be. Originally published in 2001, the book now appears in a new edition, which includes the original texts of Licklider’s three most influential writings. M. Mitchell Waldrop earned a PhD in elementary particle physics and a master’s in journalism at the University of Wisconsin. He has been a writer and editor at Science and Nature. He is the author of Man-Made Minds (1987), a book about artificial intelligence, and Complexity (1992), about the new sciences of complexity. When people ask me about Xerox PARC, I always tell them about J. C. R. Licklider—‘Lick’—and how he started the great research funding for interactive computing and pervasive worldwide networks, which have resulted in most of the technology we use today. The top book I recommend to read about this large process, which stretched over 20 years, is The Dream Machine by Mitchell Waldrop. Alan Kay computer scientist A masterpiece! A mesmerizing but balanced and comprehensive look at the making of the information revolution—the people, the ideas, the tensions, and the hurdles. John Seely Brown former director of Xerox PARC A sprawling history of the ideas, individuals, and groups of people that got us from punch cards to personal computers . . . impressive . . . compelling. New York Times The Dream Machine works admirably as an exploration of the intellectual and political roots of the rise of modern computing. It’s an ambitious and worthwhile addition to the history of science.

Max Levchin cofounder and CEO of Affirm, cofounder and former CTO of PayPal Many founders eventually face a moment in their company’s journey when they’ll need to scale the company and think much longer-term about success. Mr. Gil’s book walks founders through some of the steps and challenges they’ll face, such as the role of a board, mergers and acquisitions and more. Wall Street Journal “We are as gods and might as well get good at it,” wrote Stewart Brand in 1968, as the opening sentence to the now iconic Whole Earth Catalog. For decades, Brand has had an uncanny ability to push “ideas that seem at the edge of believability,” accelerating progress in culture, technology, environmentalism, and more. His approach to work and life influenced many technologists who have gone on to shape our modern world, including Steve Jobs. We Are As Gods, produced by Stripe Press, is the first feature film about Brand’s remarkable life. Marrying never-before-seen footage with contemporary interviews, the film chronicles his journey, from his early days with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters through the birth of the personal computing revolution, to his latest quest to reorient environmentalism. The original score was composed by experimental musician and artist Brian Eno, who’s collaborated with artists such as David Bowie, the Talking Heads, and U2. Along with Brand, Eno is a founding board member of the Long Now Foundation, whose mission is to foster long-term thinking and responsibility. He contributed 24 original tracks, in addition to some classics. Infrastructure is—finally—having its moment. From transit systems to supply chains, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and others are evaluating whether our civic infrastructure is up to the task of supporting a growing—and warming—globe. In each episode of Beneath the Surface, we explore some of the most complicated challenges facing our world, and talk to the people who are rolling up their sleeves to build solutions. The New Atlantis: Charter cities Each year, tens of millions of people migrate from rural areas to cities—mostly in emerging economies, where populations are growing faster than governments can create basic infrastructure. To address the challenges of urbanization without industrialization, development experts, economists, and policymakers have proposed solutions spanning from increased immigration to better family planning. In this episode, we ask: could charter cities—a model inspired by the successes of places like Singapore and Shenzhen—be a path to accelerating growth in emerging economies? Founder and managing partner, Pronomos Capital Founder and former executive director of the Charter Cities Institute Founder and co-managing partner of Thebe Investment Management PhD candidate at McGill University Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto, and author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Juan Du, Dean of the University of Toronto School of Architecture, discuss Du’s book, The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City—and the many myths that surround the city’s origin and development. Salton Sea: White Gold in the California Desert In 1905, an engineering accident created one of the largest lakes in the United States: the Salton Sea. Now, more than 100 years later, the lake is shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the US. But the area is also poised to become the largest lithium mine in the country—to be used by GM, Tesla, and Ford to manufacture their electric vehicles. Still, there’s an inherent tension between mining heavy metals—often a dirty, high-pollution process, for environmentally beneficial purposes. In this episode, we explore the future of energy production, how boom and bust cycles affect cities and communities, and the often overlooked environmental considerations that roil the development of green infrastructure. Author of Queen of the Salton Sea: Helen Burns and Me Journalist at VICE Research Professor at University of California, Riverside Founder of Saving the Salton Sea and director of the Salton Sea Film Festival Audrey Carleton, environmental journalist for VICE, discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea to catalyze the burgeoning electric vehicle industry, the parallels to the oil and gas industries, and what it all means for the area's residents. The Industrial Ballet: An Investigation into Global Supply Chains Thanks to the global supply chain crisis, millions of consumer goods, from computer chips to couches to cell phones are in high demand but short supply. It would be tempting to think that the pandemic is the main culprit for the backup of global trade flows—but COVID merely exposed existing fault lines in our infrastructure. The advent of just-in-time manufacturing and a relentless focus on short-term earnings have left companies with little inventory in case of emergencies, making our supply chains less resilient. Ryan Petersen—CEO of Flexport, which manages global trade and logistics for some of the largest companies in the world—has some thoughts about how we can fix that. You Say You Want to Build More Housing The price of housing in major cities has, over the past few decades, far outpaced the cost of construction. Average New York City metropolitan area house prices are up 706% since 1980 (or 376% more than US consumer prices, and 326% more than US wages). For San Francisco the rise is 932%. In Ireland, prices have risen by about 800% in that period, driven by increases in Dublin in particular. The immediate effects of the housing crunch are generally well-understood: productivity suffers when people aren’t able to live near the jobs they want. But there are other, less-explored effects of the crunch: an increase in obesity (as folks become more sedentary due to longer commutes and a lack of walkable suburbs), a decrease in birth rates (as housing is often the biggest expense for families, making it difficult to realize their ideal family size), climate change, and inequity. Still, there are reasons to be optimistic. Advocates of building more housing are gaining important victories all around the world—but it remains to be seen whether or not these victories will prove to be lasting. Head of the Urbanity Project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University Founder of YIMBY Action Associate Professor of Economics at Trinity College Dublin Community leaders in the North London Haredi community In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Ronan Lyons, Associate Professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin, discuss Ireland’s economic development, the current challenges facing would-be homeowners and renters in Dublin, and the time the biggest concern in the Irish housing market was too much supply. Growing Pains and Bullet Trains: The Art and Science of Moving People In 2016, the much-anticipated Second Avenue Subway line opened in Manhattan, New York. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project… ever—a rare new addition to one of the largest and the oldest subway systems in the world. By contrast, half a world away, Tokyo has a sprawling web of commuter trains—boasting the 50 busiest train stations in the world. Yet today, even the busiest lines in Tokyo only experience a yearly average delay of 20 seconds—and minimal incidents. How did Tokyo manage to avoid the friction common in the transit systems of other megacities? In this episode, we examine how officials in post WWII-Japan created one of the most efficient examples of scaled infrastructure in the modern world—and what cities around the world can learn from them. Author of Pedestrian Observations and the Transit Costs project Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Pioneer Valley Planning Commission, Springfield, Massachusetts Train journalist and writer of How to Enjoy Railroads From Train Schedules. In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Alex Forrest, transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts, discuss the history of transit in the US, the relationship between transit and housing prices, and the formative years Forrest spent in Japan—and how they’ve shaped his current work in Springfield. People and Ideas: Populations as Infrastructure Up to now, we’ve explored physical infrastructure: supply chains, housing, transportation, and more. But the ultimate resource for any country is its people. For most of human history, populations were fairly stable. Then, in the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution precipitated an exponential increase in population, which reached a peak in the mid-20th century. Today, however, the demographic outlook in many developed countries is the opposite: birth rates around the world have fallen below the replacement rate. In this episode, we explore the effects of declining birth rates and what, if anything, could be done to reverse them. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about population growth: what happens when governments try to influence it through policy? Assistant Professor of Quantitative Analysis, Samford University Economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and Fellow at NYU Law Author of Slow Boring and One Billion Americans Retired Teacher, English Language Institute of Singapore Retired Quantity Surveyor In this conversation, Shruti Rajagopalan, Head of India Policy Research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and host Tamara Winter discuss Shruti's research on how population growth can accelerate economic development, the unintended consequences of fertility policy, and why 1991 was a pivotal year for India.

Wooo! Finally we got lights. Tamara Winter: Lagos, Nigeria is one of the largest cities in the world. It’s home to over 14 million people and one of Africa’s main economic hubs. It’s the most populous city in the country with Africa’s largest GDP. However in Lagos, even basic services are unreliable. Archived audio: Everything comes to life when there’s light. When there’s no light you can literally feel handicapped. Tamara Winter: This isn’t a new problem in Lagos. An unstable power grid and political corruption make providing everyday utilities—like electricity—a struggle. In 2016, The Guardian reported on a neighborhood that went without power for five years because its residents refused to pay bribes. These kinds of challenges are not unique to Lagos or even to Nigeria. Across the developing world—from Jakarta to Kinshasa—cities are growing rapidly. New residents are pouring into cities that have neither the infrastructure nor the institutions to adequately serve them. In his 2005 book Planet of Slums urban theorist Mike Davis chronicled the rise of million-person cities in the developing world. He described the lives of the more than one billion people who live in the world’s slums. Booming populations of these fast-growing cities find themselves in harsh living conditions. Flooded streets. Poor ventilation. Little to no waste clearance. And few basic services. The absence of infrastructure makes life dangerous. Lack of access to sanitation and healthcare are directly responsible for high infant and maternal mortality. Communicable diseases—that have become a thing of the past elsewhere—run rampant. Despite these challenges, people across the developing world are seeking out the economic opportunities that cities provide. So, is there another way? Another avenue for people in search of a better life to access not only economic opportunities, but also stable governance and reliable institutions. In this episode, we’ll be looking at one possible solution: charter cities. Built—sometimes almost from scratch—in developing countries. These developments are outside-the-box infrastructure. Rather than reforming or building on existing cities they are new constructions often with their own economic regulations and laws. Privately backed. And focused on bringing economic growth to emerging economies. Supporters see them as a way to theoretically seed the ground for more stable institutions and improved governance. Hello and welcome to the first episode of Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. It’s not an accident that the first episode begins in Nigeria. That’s where I was born. My family moved to the United States when I was just two months old. But growing up in Texas I often wondered: what if instead of being raised in Dallas, I grew up in Lagos, like the majority of my family? That question is part of why I’ve always been so fascinated by questions about development and specifically, about Africa’s trajectory. It’s part of my story. I’m also no stranger to the world of new cities. I used to work at the Charter Cities Institute. We’ll actually hear from the institute’s founder Mark Lutter a little later in this episode. The Institute, based in Washington D.C. is a non-profit that’s working to build the ecosystem for charter cities by developing institutional frameworks that can guide their creation. Now, before we get into the nitty gritty, I want to be really clear about some of the words we’re using in this episode. You’ve already heard me say ‘new cities’ and ‘charter cities.’ There’s a pretty broad ecosystem of new city projects. So when we’re talking about the whole landscape, I’ll use the term ‘new cities’—charter cities are just one part of that world, the part most focused on leveraging the creation of new cities for global development. So, what are charter cities and where did the idea for them come from in the first place? If you spend any amount of time talking to folks about new cities there’s one name that will keep popping up. Person 1: Paul Romer Person 2: Paul Romer Person 3: Professor Paul Romer Tamara Winter: Paul. Romer. He’s not a household name, but he’s been one of the most influential economists in the world for the last 20 years. He’s a former Chief Economist at the World Bank and in 2018 he even won the Nobel Prize. Archived audio: Dear Professor Romer...the tools you have developed broaden the scope of economic analysis...I now ask you to receive your prizes from his Majesty the King. Tamara Winter: He’s a big deal—if you’re an economist. But that’s not why all these people mention his name. In 2009, he gave a TED Talk. Now this might not seem that exciting—an economist giving a 20 minute lecture about his new idea. In fact, if you watch the talk—it’s on YouTube—you might not walk away inspired to start a city of your own. Romer walks on stage his hair more salt than pepper and close-cropped, wearing blue jeans and a dark suit jacket over a button down shirt. He paces back and forth while he talks, a clicker in his right hand occasionally changing slides behind him. His voice is steady, not monotonous, but not an orator’s. The talk has been posted on YouTube for just over 12 years and has only a little more than 150,000 views. However, for many who saw this talk back in 2009, who were captivated by Romer’s ideas, it was an a-ha moment. Like when the Beatles first went on the Ed Sullivan show. Back in 1964 a generation of young music lovers saw four guys from Liverpool playing music on their TV and thought to themselves: maybe my friends and I can do that. Inspired by Romer’s talk, many entrepreneurs began wondering the same kind of thing—what if they could build charter cities too. So—Romer’s idea. Charter cities. New cosmopolitan growth centers that would promote economic development and connect developing countries to the rest of the global economy. Romer’s proposed cities would be more than special economic zones—areas with different economic regulations—they would also be special governance zones. Places where different laws would allow for faster economic growth thanks to better institutions. Romer imagined cities located in developing countries administered by the governments of developed countries. Now, more than 12 years after Romer’s talk, if you ask some of the people most involved with the movement what charter cities are, and what purposes they serve, you’ll get pretty different answers. Patri Friedman: I think of a charter city as a special jurisdiction that is a geographic area that has different laws and institutions from the rest of the country. And the amount of difference has to be more than a special economic zone which typically just has some tax breaks, tariff breaks, a small number of legal changes. Tamara Winter: That was Patri Friedman. He runs Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm which invests in new city projects. Their slogan: Better laws. Better lives. Oh, and if you caught that his last name is Friedman. Yeah, he’s the grandson of legendary economist Milton Friedman. He got his start in the world of new cities when he founded the Seasteading Institute. A non-profit that worked to establish autonomous communities on free-floating platforms stationed in international waters. Friedman’s interest in new cities came from his analysis of governance as a kind of product that should be subject to updates. Patri Friedman: Why do our cellphones get better every year and our governments maybe occasionally get better, maybe sometimes degrade and what I realized is that if you throw away all the morality and philosophy and say, “Okay this is an industry”, what characteristics does it have? Tamara Winter: Mark Lutter, the founder and executive director of the Charter Cities Institute has a slightly more technical definition of what constitutes a charter city. Mark Lutter: So a charter city is a new city development: a new city with better laws. Paul Romer, for example, was advocating that high-income countries such as Canada act as a guarantor in a low-income country such as Honduras. And the Charter Cities Institute moved away from this, I guess, this idea, this definition, arguing for a public-private partnership. Tamara Winter: Lutter founded the Charter Cities Institute just one year after finishing his PhD in economics. In his view, charter city developments, if and when successful, will have long term positive impacts beyond the cities themselves. Mark Lutter: Charter cities have primarily been focused on emerging markets, creating a space with new institutions. So this would be going to places like Nigeria, Zambia, Honduras and creating new city developments that allowed for people to be able to hire more easily to, resolve disputes more easily to pay taxes, to register a business, having a government that’s effective at providing public goods, and this would allow for sustained economic development over time. Tamara Winter: The Institute’s website lists some of the existing cities that they see as examples of this model—jurisdictions that improved their governance and, as a result, their economic output. Dubai. Singapore. Shenzhen. Hong Kong. These cities have all experienced astronomical growth in relatively short periods of time. The Charter Cities Institute’s website has a slideshow with before and after images of each city and information about their growth. The images that accompany these numbers are just as striking. Shenzhen in 1980 is a pastoral scene of green fields, rolling hills, and distant mountains—home to about 300,000 people. But by 2017, it is all sleek skyscrapers and glowing lights—a metropolis with a population to rival New York City. Oh, and the average yearly income increased over 10,000 percent, too. Browsing these figures. Listening to Friedman and Lutter. And hearing Romer’s optimism echoing from 2009, it’s easy to understand why so many people are so dedicated to promoting the idea of new cities. But what do these numbers really mean? Who are these cities being built by? And maybe more importantly, who are they being built for? I first met Mwiya Musokotwane on a trip to a remote island in Zambia. I was there as part of my work for the Charter Cities Institute. Mwiya’s a stoic, physically imposing guy, well over six feet tall. I’ve known him for a while now and he’s basically got two speeds: full suit and sweatsuit. He’s either in board rooms, meeting with elected officials, and giving presentations, or he’s at home being a doting dad, the kind who keeps a lot of pictures of his daughter in his pocket—and on his Instagram. He’s the co-managing partner, along with his father, of Thebe Investment Management and the founder of Nkwashi, a new charter city project in Zambia. Mwiya Musokotwane: Zambia, it’s kind of like the junction point between Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa, and like South Western Africa also. Lake Tanganyika which is the world’s second longest and second largest lake by volume is partly in Zambia. The source of the largest river in southern Africa is in Zambia so it’s at the confluence of these interesting things. Tamara Winter: Zambia’s natural resources, especially copper, made it a target for colonization. But Zambia had a distinctly different experience than its neighbors. Mwiya Musokotwane: You didn’t have very militarized colonial experience as was the case elsewhere in Kenya or in South Africa. So the British were very white glove here. I think part of that is Zambia was never really seen as a place where they were going to settle…it was seen as a resource country. Tamara Winter: The British occupied what they called “Northern Rhodesia” from the late 19th century all the way until 1964. After gaining freedom Zambia began to function as a democracy. However, within a decade of independence the country was under one-party rule. Mwiya Musokotwane: Seven years later became a single party socialist state, as was the fashion in Africa those days, and you know that was basically the beginning of a long and steady decline for the country. Tamara Winter: The economy was soon in crisis and actually contracted for decades. Mwiya Musokotwane: We ended up losing three to four times our GDP per capita over the 20 years of socialism that we experienced. And then people basically got to a point where they had enough and demanded liberal democracy again. Tamara Winter: After a series of coup attempts… Archived audio: Where the rebel officers had attempted to announce they had attempted to overthrow the government because it was corrupt. Tamara Winter: …and internal struggles in the 90s, that saw former leaders imprisoned… Archived audio Kenneth Kaunda: Today, God is great indeed. I am out, but I’ve not been told why I was in the prison for five months and seven days. Tamara Winter: Zambia has once again begun the move towards a multi-party democracy. Just last fall, Hakainde Hichilema, who ran for president six times in the last 15 years, was finally elected. As recently as 2017, he too spent time in prison, accused of treason for his role in anti-corruption protests against the former president. Now, Hichilema is committed to an ambitious agenda and has already begun traveling, connecting with other world leaders… Archived audio Kamala Harris: Well it is my honor and pleasure to welcome you, Mr. President, to the White House. Tamara Winter: …working to ensure that democracy in Zambia will be bolstered by strong national institutions and a renewed commitment to economic development. Archived audio Hakainde Hichilema: For us to be able to run our countries in a manner that would deliver what we may call democratic dividends. Kamala Harris: That’s right. Hakainde Hichilema: Delivering accelerated economic growth development to offer opportunities to our people. I think, Vice President, that’s what will sustain democracy. That’s what will make democracy attractive. Tamara Winter: Hichilema grew up in a farming family and spent years in international business. His presidency promises a new era for Zambia, one focused on economic growth and greater stability in the government. Mwiya, who was born in the late 80s, grew up watching Zambia’s economic and governance struggles first hand. Now in his early 30s he wants his investment firm to be an engine of development not just for Zambia, but for all of Africa. This vision drives Mwiya’s interest in Nkwashi. You can hear the same far-reaching desire when he explains why he wanted to build a city in the first place. Mwiya Musokotwane: I was asking myself, “how can I apply this to fix these problems as opposed to being a bystander?” I started thinking about the resources I had available to me. It just so happened that my family owned a ranch about a half-hour drive out of Lusaka and it was large enough that something meaningful could be done there. Tamara Winter: Mwiya mentioned Lusaka. That’s the capital city of Zambia and the largest city in the country with between two and three million residents. It’s a bit larger than Chicago and slightly smaller than Berlin. And the problems he’s talking about? Well, the city is growing fast—faster than many of its institutions can cope with. As recently as October of last year there were major blackouts across Zambia. Power isn’t the only element of infrastructure under strain in Lusaka. It’s estimated that by 2030, the city will have a shortage of three million homes. Part of Mwiya’s drive to build a new city nearby was to add another living and working hub: one that could be a home to professionals and those who want to connect more directly with the rest of the world. Mwiya Musokotwane: Nkwashi is a satellite town to Lusaka. We like to call it a knowledge city. We’re anchoring the city on institutions of learning and it’s been designed to be able to be a home to up to 100,000 people. Tamara Winter: Those learning institutions include a 130 acre university campus and the Explorer School which provides entirely online education for primary and secondary school. Archived audio: Imagine a school without borders. A school where students and teachers come from places all around the world from Bahrain to France, from Australia to Zambia. Tamara Winter: In Zambia it is common for the children of wealthier families to be educated outside of the country, in Johannesburg or even London, where Mwiya went to school. The Explorer School also reaches across borders with students in Nigeria, India and beyond but is anchored in Nkwashi. By creating learning institutions in Zambia that are internationally connected, Mwiya hopes there will be even more reason for those seeking economic and educational advancement to stay. Mwiya Musokotwane: We’re creating these institutions that hopefully can be the engines of initial economic growth. If Explorer School and Explorer Academy are fantastically successful that then creates the natural impetus to create city number two and three and four and five. Tamara Winter: Large scale new city projects like Nkwashi sit squarely at the intersection of public and private institutions. They are often so significant in scope that they require cooperation from local and national governments, in addition to willing investors. Luckily, Mwiya was prepared to navigate both of those worlds from an early age, whether or not he was fully aware of it. Mwiya Musokotwane: I didn’t really grow up with a very boxed-in view of the world. Tamara Winter: His parents made sure of that. His father is actually one of the architects of Zambia’s financial system. Mwiya Musokotwane: He’s like a super disciplined academic type person and he’s also been a central banker and economist and policy maker. A lot of the conversations he would have would be around things to do with how to develop Zambia. How to develop Africa at large. Tamara Winter: His mother was an entrepreneur. Mwiya Musokotwane: She had her own ways of conveying similar values to us. But most of hers were more practical so I think everything I learned about business as an example, I learned from her. Tamara Winter: Growing up in a household with international business interests meant an early window into the wider world. Mwiya Musokotwane: I would go with my parents on their trips to figure out different commercial undertakings they might want to get involved in like acquiring land and stuff like that at a super young age. It created this very like, explorer type mindset in me. I think that’s stuck with me into adulthood. Tamara Winter: But Mwiya was also an introverted kid who preferred his own company. Luckily at home he was in an environment that filled him with a fierce curiosity. His parents nurtured his development—each in their own way. For example, when he was 13 his father gave him a biography of Albert Einstein. His mother? Well, she gave him The Power of Positive Thinking. Mwiya Musokotwane: You know, where my dad is taciturn, she’s more expressive. Where his interests lie in more technical facts hers are much more to do with human wellbeing. He’s taught me how to build systems and she’s taught me how to lead those systems. Tamara Winter: And now, with a project like Nkwashi, Mwiya is combining lessons from both parents. Mwiya Musokotwane: Building cities and building institutions of learning...it sits right smack on the intersection between public sector and private sector work. Tamara Winter: These projects also take a hefty dose of confidence and that ‘explorer mindset’ that Mwiya described. Like Patri Friedman and Mark Lutter, Mwiya’s interest in new cities came from his dissatisfaction with the status-quo solutions he saw being offered to the structural problems in Zambia. Without Mwiya’s imagination, the land that is now becoming Nkwashi could have been put to more mundane use. Mwiya Musokotwane: There was the possibility of just subdividing allotments and then selling those, but that also felt very boring and like, low-impact. And the possibility of building something more meaningful seemed more interesting. So we’re like, “Okay we’re going to build a city.” Tamara Winter: In the red dirt and scrub brush, Mwiya saw something possibly transformational that could reach far beyond 3,000 acres outside of Lusaka. Mwiya Musokotwane: Right now what we have is a situation where Africans regardless of where they live in the world are treated as nominal equals. It’s one thing to be equal in the law, it’s another to be equal in the way someone regards you in their hearts. And I think that’s what places like Nkwashi represent for me. Tamara Winter: Mwyia’s clear sense of purpose in building Nkwashi is not always as easy to detect in the world of new cities. Nor is the seamless mix of public and private. That intersection can sometimes be an uncomfortable one. Remember, when Paul Romer proposed the notion of charter cities, he was clear: they would be special opportunity zones run by other governments. That idea met with almost instant backlash. Isabelle Simpson: The argument is that Paul Romer’s model was too neocolonial because he would have these foreign countries come and intervene, but that when it’s private entrepreneurs because they are not bound to a particular country that it’s not neocolonial. Tamara Winter: Isabelle Simpson is a PhD candidate at McGill University studying new cities and startup societies. Isabelle Simpson: But obviously from the perspective of the local people it is very much neocolonialism. Tamara Winter: Discomfort over foreign governments running cities in other countries is part of what spurred changes in how new cities are discussed and planned. Patri Friedman of Pronomos Capital—who we heard from earlier—is especially interested in thinking of new models for charter city development. Patri Friedman: That idea that a charter city is operated by a foreign power that just didn’t fly at all. So today’s charter cities are overseen by the host country and often are public private partnerships with companies that will build and operate the city. Tamara Winter: But this model presents challenges of its own. Patri Friedman: The gold standard right now is the Honduran ZEDE system. Tamara Winter: In Honduras, laws were passed to seed the ground for new city developments. Archived audio: Honduras has began to create two of the twelve regions of development and employment also known as charter cities. Tamara Winter: Called the ZEDE laws, they were so controversial they created a constitutional crisis, and inspired multiple protest movements. Local suspicion towards new city projects has been common in Honduras. One project, Prospera, has had ongoing tensions with the population that lives near its borders. Prospera has also been criticized for its legal system. A board of seven arbiters, many of them not native to Honduras, oversee private disputes in the city. They are asked to make rulings over residents who may or may not speak English and who are governed by a code that has borrowed liberally from different existing sets of laws. That’s a pretty extreme example. Mark Lutter, the director of the Charter Cities Institute, who you heard from at the beginning of the podcast, has been critical of this particular aspect of Prospera. Champions of new cities do, however, speak glowingly about the possibilities of these kinds of mix-and-match legal systems, ones that allow laws to be switched out and updated like software. From Patri Friedman. Patri Friedman: What’s interesting to me from an infrastructure perspective is that modifying other kinds of infrastructure—power systems or sewer systems of a city—is very, very difficult but law is a virtual layer so it can be modified the same way you deploy new software builds. Tamara Winter: And the sources for these new software builds? They can come from almost anywhere. Patri Friedman: It’s a really, really interesting point of leverage to say can we essentially write better operating systems or copy the existing operating systems, that is, copy functional sets of laws and administrative procedures from countries that work well and bring them to other countries. Tamara Winter: To critics of the new city movement this description of governance sounds too straightforward. It is emblematic of the tendency of charter city advocates to oversimplify complex issues. Isabelle Simpson goes all the way back to the first moments of Paul Romer’s original TED talk as an example. Isabelle Simpson: He begins this talk by showing an Associated Press photo of African students who are sitting under streetlights at an airport and they’re sort of bent over their textbooks. Archived audio Paul Romer: Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. Isabelle Simpson: So already I find this sort of annoying because people have this really bad habit when they want to illustrate dysfunction or chaos they use Africa. Archived audio Paul Romer: These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don’t have any electricity at home. Isabelle Simpson: And Romer does not mention that the students are from the Republic of Guinea and the airport is the international airport there. And the year is 2007. Archived audio Paul Romer: Let’s just pick one, for example the one in the green shirt. Isabelle Simpson: Romer then gives one of the students a fictive name, “We’re going to name him Nelson.” Archived audio Paul Romer: Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: I bet Nelson has a cellphone. Archived audio Paul Romer: I’ll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here’s the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology like the cell phone, but doesn’t have access to a 100 year old technology for generating electric light in the home? Now in a word the answer is rules. Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that’s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: Actually the causes of electricity blackouts here are complex and a comprehensive explanation would have required Romer to address in addition to the poor tariff structures—what he says are the ‘bad rules’—he would have had to talk about the country’s weak infrastructure, issues of transmission and distribution losses, supply shortages and lack of diversity in the electricity generation mix, corruption distorting contract negotiation, and the neocolonial economic situation that thrives on extraction by foreign companies which are the ones grabbing the most electricity at the lowest price. All these complex elements, they don’t fit into Romer’s narrative about bad rules. Tamara Winter: The reason scholars like Simpson fear this simplification is because simple-sounding problems invite simple solutions that overlook necessary complexities. Isabelle Simpson: If you say that you want to build a new city what is it exactly that you mean by city? Isn’t a city a political space where people with different opinions and different ambitions will come and debate and sort of try to create this better society all the time? Or are you trying to create this community of like-minded people which ultimately is just sort of a gated community? Tamara Winter: In addition to political questions about new cities, there are also cultural and historical ones. Juan Du is the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. She’s also… Juan Du: …the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto. Tamara Winter: In her book, she pushes back on the popular narrative about Shenzhen: that until 1979 it was a sparsely populated backwater. And after government investment and its designation as a special economic zone only then did its population and economic output explode. Juan Du: I think it’s important to keep in mind what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top-down policy, it was a bottom-up willingness that people wanted to go there. Tamara Winter: In her book, Du unpacks how Shenzhen’s history allowed it to rapidly transform into the megacity it is today. Juan Du: The centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. The incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen was built up on foundations that was already preexisting and those foundations took decades if not millennium to be built. Tamara Winter: Du also takes issue with many of the popular statistics about Shenzhen pre-1979 that feed the city-built-from-scratch narrative. Juan Du: People think that in 1979 it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that have 30,000, especially a sleepy one and a small one at that. Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. Tamara Winter: The population of that 2,000 village conglomerate? Closer to 300,000. And it was this preexisting network that ushered contemporary Shenzhen into being. Juan Du: There are so much local and indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first ten years. Tamara Winter: The willingness in the new city world to downplay this part of Shenzhen’s story in favor of a more a-historical, top-down narrative worries Du. Juan Du: City making is a very, very complex and difficult process. The misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch that it was a blank slate or a tabula rasa is, I think, the most dangerous misconception. That one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. Tamara Winter: But looking at some proposed new city projects it seems like that’s exactly what certain investors hope to do. In 2020, Hong Kong real estate developer Ivan Ko proposed a creatively named new city “Nextpolis” to be located in Ireland and populated by residents of Hong Kong who wanted to escape that city’s increasingly challenging political environment. There was also a proposal in Singapore for a floating city that could house migrant workers and move, when needed, to be near construction projects. These simple-sounding solutions point to other important questions that need to be addressed in the new city ecosystem. Like who has a say in governance. Simpson points out that many of the cities cited as examples of new city developments—Shenzhen, Dubai, Singapore—are also those with restrictive, even authoritarian, national governments. Isabelle Simpson: It’s very bizarre that charter cities entrepreneurs would use this very authoritarian model as their blueprint for this sort of pro-free market, pro-freedom, individual freedom developments that they’re trying to do. Tamara Winter: One of the most high profile new city projects currently under construction— Saudi Arabia’s NEOM—fits this mold. Archived audio: The contemporary city needs a full redesign. What if we removed cars? What if we got rid of streets? What if we innovated in the public space? Tamara Winter: Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars of government money, this ambitious plan includes everything from automated ports, to city modules spread out over hundreds of miles of desert and connected by high-speed rail. Promotional materials make it sound almost irresistible. As one Wall Street Journal article put it: it’s Disneyland meets Dubai. Archived audio: Through advanced manufacturing methods we will create green industries of the future with sustainability and reusability built into their DNA. Because any business destined to change the world, must also protect it. Tamara Winter: NEOM is part of Saudi Vision 2030, the flagship project of the authoritarian Saudi government of Muhammed bin Salman. It has ruthlessly targeted journalists, activists, and critics at home and abroad. Isabelle Simpson: Entrepreneurs who are very insistent on freedom of association, freedom of movement, freedom of speech. Their model for charter cities are authoritarian countries. Tamara Winter: Nkwashi, however, is not this kind of project. It’s being built in Zambia by someone with deep roots in the country. And it is being supported by a new administration that is committed to using economic development to build more democratic institutions. Some form of government support is crucial in creating a new city. The projects that succeed will have both government support and a significant connection to the place where they are being built. Nkwashi has that connection. Even the name of the city speaks to its Zambian roots. Mwiya Musokotwane: It means eagle and so the Zambian national bird is the fish eagle and so we decided to name the city after the national bird and we chose to name it in a language that was indigenous to the area. Tamara Winter: However, these close ties don’t mean the city and the ideas that come along with it will be instantly adopted. Mwiya Musokotwane: I think people think of us as being fairly forward-thinking and maybe a little bit crazy sometimes, but I think in a good way. Tamara Winter: Some might view Nkwashi as ‘crazy’ but that hasn’t really harmed its popularity. Mwiya Musokotwane: And you know we sold out in like three months; that initial batch of I think 80 five-acre plots, it was. Tamara Winter: And Mwiya firmly believes in the mission behind Nkwashi—not just the city, but what it could represent. Mwiya Musokotwane: I see Nkwashi as a beta, as a proof of concept. Speaking as an African, I think one of the challenges Africa has had is we haven’t yet done really big interesting things as a continent—the kind of things where people look at them and say, “Oh wow that’s like super cool that has a lot of positive impact not just for Africa but for the world at large.” Tamara Winter: That drive to change perception is a personal one for Mwiya, shaped by experiences he had during his university years in London. At 17, he left Zambia, hopeful and a bit apprehensive. Tamara Winter: He made friends quickly and found community in the classroom. However, while in London he also experienced everyday racism. This might not sound that revelatory—a young African man encountering racism in early 2000s London. What makes these experiences so important is the way Mwiya talks about them. Mwiya Musokotwane: Running in the train station to catch the train and then policemen in the train station stop you like, “Where are you running to?” I’m in a train station, it’s obvious I’m going to catch a train. You know, it’s interactions like that where I felt like I was nominally equal. Tamara Winter: Did you catch that? Nominally equal. Mwiya uses the same words talking about these incidents as he does when describing the necessity of Nkwashi. If Nkwashi is proof of concept and other similar new cities can be built around Africa, Mwiya hopes that—in time—through the educational and institutional development they bring, the international perception of Africa and Africans can change. In the end, there are as many questions about the future of new cities now as there were twelve years ago when Romer gave his talk. Maybe even more since there are real projects being launched. I was once a die-hard evangelist for new cities, a true believer. I still see the promise in the model, but now I approach the subject with more humility. Basically I’m trying to remember how little I know about what the next decades of new city development will entail. The world of new cities is shifting all the time. There have been some major changes just in the last few weeks. Remember the ZEDE laws in Honduras? They don’t even exist any more! They were unanimously repealed by Honduras’ national congress. I’m still optimistic that some version of new cities will fit into the fabric of solutions to economic challenges. But I also recognize that, in 30 years, the actual model or models that succeed may look very different from many of the projects that have been proposed so far. In the meantime, knowing there are people like Mwiya out there, thoughtful enough to meaningfully consider the big questions facing their societies and daring enough to work on audacious solutions, gives me a lot of hope.

Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the first episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Juan Du. She is the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto and the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. In our conversation she offers insights into Shenzhen’s history, explains the personal connection to the city that inspired her to spend 15 years writing a book about it, and reveals why she thinks the ‘Shenzhen Experiment,’ as she calls it, is far from over. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dean Juan Du. Tamara Winter: So we’ll start with the hardest question first. Tell me your name, your academic affiliations, and why I’m talking to you right now. Juan Du: The why I’m not sure if I can tell you! So, hello, my name is Juan Du, I am the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto in Canada. And I recently relocated in the last six months from Hong Kong to Toronto. So it’s nice to be speaking with you. Tamara Winter: And tell me, so you’re an architect by trade. I would love if you could tell me a little bit about your background. How did you end up writing this book? Because, well you know certainly Shenzhen’s architecture is mentioned, that isn’t really the defining feature of the book. And maybe you could tell folks what the name of your book is as well. Juan Du: Sure. So the book is called The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City and the book as it was published is probably the fifth evolution of it or reincarnation of it. I didn’t start out by writing such a book because I am trained in architecture. And I started out to write a more architectural book about the city and specifically about the urban villages of the city. However, as I started to uncover more and more about the urban villages, I discovered a larger story really at the story of the city and the story of China. It is a story that I think is very misunderstood. It essentially is the story of China in the last 40 years and how that is contextualized within a broader understanding of the history of China, perhaps over a few centuries. So it just became a much bigger book, perhaps not in length, but in scope, the more I researched and worked on that. One of the first reasons why I wanted to write the book is actually based in my first hand experience of planning and design projects in Shenzhen. And I came across this deep history and vibrant, overlooked, urban neighborhoods that is not present in the way that Shenzhen is typically portrayed in either national media in China and especially international media in the world. It’s usually portrayed as the city without history, the city without any important pre-urbanization culture or people of significance. And that was just very much contrary to what my own experiences and later my own research uncovered. So this is why I decided to take on this challenge of writing this book. And it was very difficult for me, precisely because I wasn’t trained particularly to write such an expansive book, but it was very much a learning journey. And with these knowledge and lessons that I’ve uncovered over a decade of research and writing, I think it does contribute back to my own discipline of architecture and urban planning and design, but also I hope it contributes to others who are interested in economics, politics, geography, environmental transformation, whether it is in the Chinese context or anywhere else in the world. Tamara Winter: For anyone who isn’t familiar, what is Shenzhen? Where is it? And maybe you can answer this now, or I can ask it again in just a little bit, why is Shenzhen such a significant city? Juan Du: Sure. I’ll start with the ‘where’ first, maybe. So Shenzhen is located in southern China. It’s at the southern east most tip of China, just north of a river from Hong Kong. And the river is called the Shenzhen River. And this river is the border between the city of Shenzhen and the city of Hong Kong. And it used to also be an international border that you know defined between China and colonial era Hong Kong, which was ruled by the British. So it is a very interesting location. I would also say that what’s a unique geographical feature, in addition to where it’s located, is the people via one fact: it is the only city in China’s southern region where the primary dialogue is not Cantonese, which is the southern dialogue of China. The primary dialogue in Shenzhen is Mandarin, which is a typically northern dialogue that people have used to speak everywhere in China. So this is not to say that Shenzhen is a northern city, but it really testifies to the cosmopolitan nature of the city, that it is located in the southern tip. And it has a very rich southern history of China, but it is a city of migrants from all across China. And it’s really, I would say the most diverse city in China in terms of the backgrounds of people and where they’re from geographically and perhaps also socioeconomically. And I think that for me, is what makes it a significant city. And I would say that it also makes Shenzhen the most dynamic city in China today because of that mixture, because of that diversity. And it has this extreme mixture of low tech and high tech industries, it has this extreme mixture of urban and rural cultures. It has this extreme mixture of kind of the very local regional quality of a southern city with international enterprises and international headquarters via where it is and its unique history. It’s also significant if we want to speak about numbers, it’s also significant in terms of its population number. It is a city of 20 million people, which makes it a rare mega city in the world, 20 million. But what makes it more unique is that in the 1970s, the population in Shenzhen was 300,000. So it went from 300,000 to 10 million in two decades. And then when it was 10 million in the early 2000s, everyone said, “Well, this is it. This must be it. I mean, Shenzhen has reached this potential. It’s no longer unique. It’s no longer special.” Yet, over the following decade and two decades, it continued to grow into where it is today, a city, 20 million people. And that makes it an internationally significant city because that type of population growth, not only is it unprecedented in China, it’s unprecedented in the world, anywhere, at any moment of history, in the world. Tamara Winter: I really appreciate that because you just flagged Shenzhen’s population in the '70s. I’m going to come back and ask you a question about that because when I was working at the Charter Cities Institute, I was under the impression that the population was actually 30,000, but there’s a very particular reason why you used the 300,000 number. Juan Du: Yeah. Tamara Winter: But there were a lot of people who speak as though Shenzhen’s history began in 1979. Why was 1979 such a significant year for China more broadly? Juan Du: Right. So 1979 is a very significant year for both Shenzhen and China. In 1979 was the year, the city of Shenzhen was established, meaning it was formally designated as an urban unit. So prior to 1979, the region was called Bao’an county, which was a rural county in the province of Guangdong. So in 1979, it was designated on this special entity as a city of Shenzhen, but the further significance of 1979 to both Shenzhen and China is because 1979 was the year China, via the central government in Beijing, launched China’s reform and opening. It was basically the beginning of a series of economic and sociopolitical reforms that entirely pivoted China’s economy and culture onto the world stage and into the identity of what China is today, internationally. I think for anyone who perhaps do not have that particular memory or anyone who’s younger than 50, I would imagine that they would be very shocked if they’re shown images or facts about what China was like in the 1960s and '70s, including anyone who’s younger than 50 in China today. The year 1979 to launch, it was a very pivotal moment and pivotal year. It’s not to say everything was instant.1979 launched the reform and opening. 1979 established the city of Shenzhen, but the first decade of that was very rocky. It was very difficult. It was very challenging. Shenzhen was very close to being shut down multiple times, reform opening policies was close to shut down multiple times. It wasn’t until the mid 1990s, right, almost two decades after 1979, did it stabilize and the country and the city had enough confidence that this is definitely the right direction for the city and for the country. Tamara Winter: And for anybody who doesn’t already know, how did allowing Shenzhen, designating it as a special economic zone, change the city? I mean, you’ve alluded now to population growth. I’m also curious about GDP growth and more broadly how Shenzhen’s success really impacted the whole country. Juan Du: In 1979, what was initiated was not only the city of Shenzhen, there also was initiated a policy to create special economic zones. And in 1979, Shenzhen was one of four special economic zones that was created. So what makes Shenzhen’s beginning as a city unique is that within that year, it was both a city and a special economic zone in China. There are many conversations about special economic zones. It continued to be used almost like a miracle growth formula in the world today, especially in developing economies and cities, what it meant for China at that time for Shenzhen, at that time by special economic zone, it simply meant within the designated special economic zone of Shenzhen, which was only actually the southern half of the city of Shenzhen. But within that special economic zone that the zone and the city government had the power to create an experiment with various policies and various mechanisms that was not legal, that was not allowed and not existent outside of the zone. And I also think sociopolitical reforms and policies that were experimented with, that at the time was not possible anywhere else in China. For example, at that time, if you were not born in a particular city and had its local residency status, which is called Hukou in China, you cannot legally work in anywhere but that city. You cannot get a job, you cannot get housing, you cannot get married anywhere else, but that city. It was very much mechanism of economic and population management system in China, let’s say, that it was a planned economy. But because Shenzhen was designated as a special economic zone, in Shenzhen if you were a migrant from somewhere else, from another city, from a rural region, from a village, you could get a job. You could go to school, you could rent a home, you could get married, you could make so many decisions about your own life that at the time in China, you couldn’t. And that’s why it was significant. And I would say, that’s what attracted people to go there. So what makes it unique, it’s not only the number and the population growth. I think the question is that why did all these people go there? That’s one of the biggest, I think overlooked lessons. Shenzhen as is being discussed either as a charter city precedent or model, or as a special economic zone model. I think it’s important to keep in mind, is that what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top down policy. It was a bottom up willingness that people wanted to go there. People were not forced to go there. People were not sent to go there. People left the comfort of their home. People left the comfort of their jobs and their families to go to, at the time, I said the first decade was very difficult for Shenzhen, but people left the comfort of their home. And under a planned economy, if you had a job, you had that job for life. It may not be a job you love, but you had it. You had housing, you had a job, you had your basic social networks. Within those first decade, the type of people that the city attracted were a very unique type of people. It was people who was more adventurous, it was people who is entrepreneurial. It was people who are not satisfied with what life offered them in wherever they were. So what makes Shenzhen a really interesting case study for me is a much more closer understanding of what propels people, what would attract someone to whichever place or whichever socioeconomic costs are coming from. What would attract someone to leave everything they know, and go to this place and believe that it is a land and opportunity. And to the testament of Shenzhen, even though there has been, of course, many people who arrived in Shenzhen and couldn’t make it and left, but many more did stay, right? The fact that it started with the population 300,000, now it’s 20 million. We’re basically talking about 20 million migrants, 20 million people, because it’s only within four decades, right? New population growth. Those were born in Shenzhen is still not the majority of the 20 million. The majority of the 20 million are migrants from everywhere else. They went to Shenzhen and they were able to, despite whatever challenges of a new environment, changing policy, they were able to take root and take advantage of the various unique opportunities that the city have offered and was able to make their homes there. Tamara Winter: You went to Shenzhen, I believe in 2005, I love that the book kind of starts and ends in the same place. Forgive me if I say this wrong, in Baishizhou, what did you see when you first got to Shenzhen and why is that specific village so significant to you? Juan Du: I did use Baishizhou, a particular urban village, as a historical site and device to open the book and end the book. And there are personal reasons. And I think for me also intellectual reasons to want to do that. Personal reasons is that in 2005, I was working in Beijing at the time and I was flying to Shenzhen to work. And I would fly to Shenzhen once every week or every two weeks. I’d fly in in the morning and I’d leave in the last flight out, because why would I want to stay in Shenzhen, it’s a city with no history, no culture. I’m only going there on business. And then one day my meeting ran over, the city official, the urban planner that I became very good friends with decades later was driving a bit too slow, going to the airport. And I missed my flight. So the city put me up in a hotel. It was a place called Overseas Chinese Town, O-C-T, which is the nicest neighborhood in Shenzhen. It has these kind of Italian villas. It has a very famous theme park. It has these tree-lined streets and some business hotels. So I was put there to stay for the night and take my first flight out the next morning. And in the hotel room, I couldn’t sleep. So I thought maybe a walk would do it. So I started walking and got lost and walked into this incredible scene, this was probably past midnight already, of a city square with everyone full of people at midnight, full of people, cooking and eating and this outdoor market, lots of kids running around. And I described it as seeing, I think in my book rather cinematically, but it was a very cinematic experience. It was as if I discovered this new world that no one had told me about, none of the architects and planners and government officials I had met at that time in Shenzhen, because I was just starting to understand the city has ever mentioned such a place of urban villages. None of what I’ve read about the city have talked about it. So it was just this incredible thing. And then later I was to understand that Baishizhou is the city’s largest and most populous urban village. It has this incredible history that I speak about in the book, I think in one of the chapters. And I did decide to end, I believe it was the last chapter on Baishizhou as well to, in some ways to talk about what started out as a very touristic understanding of what the urban village is and what the city is. But after a decade and a half of researching and interacting and learning from the local residents and the local scholars, I start to really have a much deeper understanding. However, by, at the end of the 15 years, Baishizhou was in the process of being cleared out for demolition. So I really wanted to be able to include that part in the book to really put in some ways a sense of urgency to what I wanted to call out to attention of both the people in Shenzhen, people in China, people everywhere else is that very often what’s happening through an urbanization process of so-called urban renewal, what we are demolishing, which on the surface might cosmetically look as if it shouldn’t be there, that in fact is the very heart and engine of what made that city vibrant and important in the first place. And that, for me, I think has a certain degree of urgency and has a degree of importance to be able to share with an international audience. Tamara Winter: Your book does, I think a masterful job of pointing out many misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen, whether it’s that Shenzhen’s success should primarily be attributed to top down government, to the idea that Shenzhen before the city kind of grew to become what we know it to be today, had no one there and it was just kind of this like back woods village and the land was pretty insignificant. So I’m wondering if you could tell me what are maybe some of the sort of most jarring misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen and why was it so important to you to kind of take pains to correct them? Juan Du: The reason why it’s important for me to put that front and center is because I had those very same misperceptions and misconceptions of the city when I started first going there. But what’s different between myself and perhaps the greater media perhaps is that my misconceptions are very quickly dispelled by me understanding the city more, but then is to watch that those misconceptions, not only did it stay throughout the decade and half I was researching and writing the book, they actually grew, it grew in their status. And it grew in the number of people who held them, it was primarily at first just kind of a national discussion. And then it became an international, Shenzhen became an international model city. And with Shenzhen’s reputation rising in the last decade, the misconceptions also arose in their importance and impact. So I thought it was really important to outline that and to say that this is why I’m writing the book, is I wanted people to have an understanding that not only is Shenzhen not the way that is commonly being perceived. In fact, it is the exact opposite. That’s what I think is really intriguing and unfortunate to me about these misconceptions of Shenzhen, and there’s many. But I think for the purpose for the book and for the purpose of me trying to create it more succinctly and communicate them, I had outlined that there was misconceptions of time, misconceptions of people, misconceptions of purpose. So misconceptions of time, we spoke about the fact that Shenzhen was established as a city in 1979. And for the most part, we’ve been speaking about the city’s growth in the past four decades and how that paralleled or instigates, actually, the growth of China in terms of economics in the past four decades. However, if you have read my book, you understand that in the book, I take pains to research and create evidence to show that the centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. And that if we did not understand what had happened in Shenzhen in the region in China prior to 1979, there could be no understanding of why Shenzhen was created. Why there was this special economic zone. Why China launched the reform opening. And most importantly, I think I wanted to evidence and I hope it was compelling to anyone who has read the book that the incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen in the past four decades absolutely was built up on foundations that was already preexistent in the region. And those foundations took decades, if not millennium, to be built. And that if Shenzhen was what people think it was in 1979, and this is where the misconception at place is also one of the misconception is that people think that in 1979, it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that has 30,000, especially a sleepy one and small one at that. But Shenzhen was not a small sleeping fishing village. Even if we don’t look at the population statistics, Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. And this is really important to understand the region and this particular place, the people, the geography, the fact that it was a port, the fact that it had these rivers, the fact that it had all of this land, that was cultivated. So that geographic understanding is really important because the misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch, that it was a blank slate or tabula rasa is I think the most dangerous misconception that one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. So I think that really is the biggest and most dangerous misconception of Shenzhen because that’s not how it happened. And the reason why I say it’s the most dangerous misconception is that Shenzhen now has been used as a model city in the context of charter cities, in the context of new cities, in the context of special economic zones, to demonstrate that not only is it possible to grow a city from blank, to plan a city from nothing. And all you had to do is add foreign direct investment. Not only is it not that, it’s the opposite of that. There was so much local indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first 10 years. And this is really something that I’m very passionate about to advocate because I believe in the importance of cities, I even believe in charter cities as something that’s important to talk about, I believe that we can make new cities and make it livable and attractive, but we also need to understand that it’s not just add money or just add policy, there is no miracle growth in this way that it is city making. It’s a very, very complex and difficult process. And if my study of Shenzhen hopefully can evidence is that it’s really important to understand that preexisting geography of people, history, culture of that place and that we should see those existing geographies, not as something to get rid of, not as a inconvenience, not as a nuisance, but really see them as the key ingredient, the seeds, if you will, that can contribute to the success of the future new city or the future new charter city. Tamara Winter: I think a lesser understood part of Shenzhen’s kind of contribution to the world, its cultural contributions. There’s a music video that you reference. This is around the time that you’re starting to get the first music videos coming out of China and these music videos are being shot literally as the city is being constructed. And one thing you’ve taken quite a lot of care to sort of show, not tell people about, and whether it’s in your book or in your appearances since then, is the real spirit of the people in Shenzhen. Juan Du: Yeah. So, I think in the book, I say one evidence, the first master plan of Shenzhen was based on a anticipation of a population 1 million by 2010. And by all accounts, that was a very ambitious master plan. There are not many cities that was able to go from scratch to 1 million. It was already a very ambitious plan, top down planning, many cities who’s been planned to have city of 1 million do not have any, right. There are many ghost towns, whether in China or elsewhere, more top down planned cities fail than succeed. So the top down planning from policy, from resources, infrastructure, housing, central funding, what have you, anticipated population of 1 million by 2010. The actual population in 2010 in Shenzhen was 10 million, 10 times more than what was planned via policy and the various instruments of that, whether economic or spatial. So 90% was unanticipated bottom up, right? 90% was just, people wanted to go there. And this is where the importance of the urban village I was speaking about earlier because the city was planned with its infrastructure, whether it’s housing, schools, hospitals, restaurants, to serve a particular proportion of the population. Who made up for the 90%? The local communities, the local villages, they turned their own houses into rental housing. And then once they had rental housing, the new migrants opened up restaurants. So what’s interesting of Baishizhou is that you can walk into any street in Baishizhou, and you can, within one hour, sample food from all over China, because they’re all opened by migrants from all over China. So this is what I mean by that I think we have underestimated the powers of bottom up action and bottom up growth. And because the book is intended for a general intellectual audience, I do not put too much academic or theoretical terms in there, but that aligns with my own work, in understanding informal urbanization, informal settlements, and to understand how communities build their own housing, build their own economy, build their own social network and social systems. And I’ve come to really understand that for a city to be a healthy, vibrant, expanding city, you need both formal or top down policy and planning and governance. It’s not just, that’s not important. It’s very important without that 10%, right? Without that top down, there would’ve been no Shenzhen. But this other part, the informal growth, the informal settlements, kind of these informal networks that very much is tied into and contributed to that formal economy, that formal policy, you need that without the informal on the bottom up, there would be no Shenzhen as we understand it today, and we would not be speaking about it and I would not have written a book and it would not be cited in India and Africa, Honduras, Ireland, wherever it is around the world as a model city, right? Because that top down aspect, that kind of planning aspect is actually quite standard, but it’s this kind of how these policies, when emerged with the local population of the preexisting villages and were emerged with all of these people from all around the country, coming into this one city and all collectively believing in the possibility of the new. That is an incredible, I think, a social, psychological experiment. So, I go back to why I called my book The Shenzhen Experiment is because I think that it is very much an experimental city. It was set up as an experiment for China to experiment with, can you have market economy in a communist country? But I think its significance goes way beyond that. It’s an experimental city in understanding human nature. It’s an experimental city in understanding both the incredible opportunities of urbanization and rapid growth, but also the native impacts on the environment on the geography of rapid urbanization. You know, the fact that it’s the state of where it is today, of being say a mega city of between 10 million to 20 million people, it’s only in the last two decades. That makes it one of the world’s youngest cities and newest experiments. I think in the conclusion of my book, I said, “I think the Shenzhen experiment’s far from over.” So I am always very uncomfortable, even myself to make any very declarative or conclusive comments about Shenzhen, because I think we don’t really understand it yet. Despite the fact that I’ve spent these time researching into it and reading everything I can about Shenzhen and southern China, I think there’s still so many more we don’t know about the city. There’s so much more lessons to uncover. So I think this experiment continues and where the city is today and where it’s going to go, it’s an open question. It’s an absolute open question. So for me, is that there’s so much for us to learn about this city and for the knowledge and experience of the city to benefit both cities and governance and also individuals in China, in Asia, but also I think there’s a lot of lessons to offer to people from all around the world, whether they’re decision makers or they’re citizens themselves. In the book, I do highlight a number of individuals I have met. Some of them are historical figures, and some of them are common everyday people and how their own lives were impacted by the urbanization of the city. But also I wanted to show how they, as individuals contributed to the city and ultimately shaped the city. And one thing I always like to remind myself and remind everyone else, that 20 million sounds like a monolith block. It’s very common for when, especially in the American context, when we look at Chinese cities or when we look at China, we see these huge gigantic numbers and that just automatically turns apart your brain into thinking that is monolith. But I do want to highlight that it’s 20 million of individuals and it’s 20 million individuals not unlike you and I. It’s 20 million individuals who have their strengths and weaknesses, who have their own neuroses, who have their emotional baggage. And these individuals, whether they’re mayors or they’re construction workers, they have had and continue to have influences in shaping the city and that’s whether it’s in Shenzhen or elsewhere. And that ultimately is something that I really would like for, especially the English reading audience and especially the North American audience, to have a more humanistic understanding of Shenzhen, to have a more humanistic understanding of China, to have a more humanistic understanding of cities that in one country or in one city, there are so many diverse views and so many different diverse entities and that individuals, nationalities, places of residence should not be grouped in within one overarching understanding about one particular country. Imagine if that be the case in the reverse, right. Do we, as individuals, want to be defined by the overall message that came out of the U.S in the past five years? I would think not. So in the same way, I would also ask everyone to have the curiosity, to try to understand whether it’s China or India or Africa or France, to understand the nuances of these political situations, and to understand the difference between national politics and individual rights and individual dreams.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: Earlier this year I visited California’s Salton Sea for the first time. I went with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s a producer on this podcast, and you’ll hear from him throughout this episode. It was his first trip back in over 20 years. Everett Katigbak: It just surprised me how little has changed. But also seeing the lake itself was kind of surprising. When I was standing there the other day, it’s a no man’s land. It’s literally scenes out of Mad Max. I know we say that kind of jokingly, but you can really envision it. Tamara Winter: Since the waters of the Colorado River rushed into the Salton Basin in 1905, the lake they created has been a source of promise and conflict. Now it’s shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the country. It’s also poised to become one of the largest sources of lithium in the United States. As the world transitions from gas to electric vehicles, demand for lithium is increasing rapidly. And so is interest in the Salton Sea. The potential for investment and industry could be transformational for the area. But what will that transformation look like? What impact will lithium extraction have on local communities? And what can examining the history of the Salton Sea reveal about its present and future? Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter. In the first episode of Beneath the Surface we looked at charter cities. New urban developments built almost from scratch through financial investment and political will. In this episode we’re visiting a very different kind of place. Everett Katigbak: So we’re here in Salton City. This is, I think the largest community out here around the Salton Sea. Tamara Winter: The communities that have grown near the Salton Sea are unincorporated. And include everything from off-the-grid artist communities to half-inhabited suburban developments. The fate of these communities is tied to the sea. When it was a tourist destination they felt the benefits. But that opportunity has long since dried up, along with the sea. Now, the promise of becoming a ‘lithium valley’ is bringing a wave of development that could breathe new life into the area. I mentioned my colleague Everett. Well, when we started talking about doing an episode on the history and future of Salton Sea, we found out that Everett and his family have a stake in the area. At the tail end of the Salton Sea’s resort era, his family bought some land there. Hoping, like many, that it was an up-and-coming oasis. Everett Katigbak: This is the place where when I was young my parents actually bought a plot of land. We’re literally standing on this plot of land. Around it there’s a handful of homes, but for the most part it’s a bunch of empty lots out here. It is a very picturesque view. It’s like a postcard. But I imagine the closer you get to it the less photogenic it gets. Tamara Winter: You have a daughter Drew. How do you hope she experiences the Salton Sea? Do you think in her lifetime it might get, I don’t know, poppin’? Everett Katigbak: I don’t know…I don’t imagine she’ll have any connection to it. I never talked about it growing up. It’s just something I totally forgot about. The more my parents are getting older and thinking they need to let go of this place the more I’m hearing about the lithium stuff. So for me it’s something that I kind of want to hold onto for a little longer and see if something happens. Tamara Winter: In the early 20th century, major construction projects were underway across southern California. Engineers planned irrigation canal networks to bring water to arid corners of the California desert. The dream at the time was to provide water for farming to the scorching hot Imperial Valley where temperatures regularly spike well above 100 degrees. Rain rarely falls. And snow has been recorded only once in the last century. But nature had other plans. For millennia, the Colorado River had occasionally made its way into the Salton Basin, creating lakes. But in the spring and summer of 1905 multiple floods wore down and eventually broke through the canal gates. And water poured into the basin. Initial attempts to close off the flow of water failed miserably. Another flood in November swept away the hastily constructed dams of gravel and brush. For two years the water flowed. And for two years crews worked around the clock. In sweltering temperatures. Under the threat of multi million-gallon flash floods. To redirect the river. When the water was finally stopped, the newly formed Salton Sea covered over 400 square miles. The early years of the Sea were mostly quiet. Naturalists categorized the many species of birds that began to congregate on its shores. The Salton Sea Wildlife Refuge was created. During the Second World War the sea became a source for fish when German u-boats made the ocean too dangerous. The military used the sea for bombing exercises. In fact, the crew that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima flew practice missions over the Salton Sea. The sea, however, was already shrinking and becoming saltier and saltier. But this didn’t stop interest in the sea from growing during the postwar economic boom. One of the people who moved to the Salton Sea after World War II was Helen Burns. She and her family made their home on a small plot of land owned by her father. Her daughter Donna Kennedy—who was barely more than a toddler at the time—remembers those early years well. Donna Kennedy: She moved us down to the Salton Sea into a trailer which had an adjacent outhouse. And we had a standpipe where we could stand and bathe. It didn’t make any difference that we were nude because no one else was there, it was completely deserted, just us. Tamara Winter: Living in the semi-wild meant Donna and her sister had a unique childhood. Donna Kennedy: We did a lot of swimming in the sea, it was very clean then. Sandy beach and very lovely. So my sister and I would just frolic in the water and the sagebrush and try to catch lizards and avoid snakes and scorpions too, we didn’t care for scorpions. Tamara Winter: Helen, however, had big dreams. She set up a makeshift stand built out of a piano box and some palm fronds. Truck drivers. Immigrants trekking up from Mexico. Occasional tourists. They all stopped by Helen’s for soda, coffee, postcards, or tubes of Salton Sea sand. Business grew. And so did the number of tourists. The Salton Sea became a destination, marketed as an inland resort—the next Palm Springs. By the 1950s the Salton Sea was the place to be. And Helen expanded to meet the demand. Donna Kennedy: Basically if you wanted to have some fun you went to Helen’s. At her high point she had a marina, a boat dock, gas tanks. A campground. Besides the bar and restaurant, the motel, but I’d say by 1958 things were really moving. On 4th of July she had hell divers and people water skied across the sea and back and got trophies and wore little horns. On New Years she had icebreakers and people skied across and back. There was the Miss Salton Sea Contest, the Mr. Salton Sea Contest. There were treasure trails where people went across the desert in their dune buggies and they’d try to find all the treasures she had hidden…it was just roaring with activity. Tamara Winter: Helen even earned a new title: Queen of the Salton Sea.Helen wasn’t the only one who saw the promise of the sea in the 50s and 60s. Other entrepreneurs, sensing opportunity, hitched their fortunes to the sea. The newly formed Salton City grew and grew. Promotional videos from the time show a desert oasis, a paradise of crystalline waters and inviting beaches. The future for Salton Sea couldn’t have looked brighter. Archived audio: In an article appearing in the The Los Angeles Times April 17th, 1966, Salton City was chosen by a group of planners, architects, administrative officers, politicians, professors, and associated thinkers as one of the 24 major cities in southern California in the year 2000. Tamara Winter: By the late 1960s and early 1970s however, tourism was drying up. And so was the sea. The water level dropped so significantly and the salt level rose so much, environmental observers worried that the fish and birds that lived in and around the sea would begin to die. The lack of rainfall in the Imperial Valley meant that the sea’s main source of new water was agricultural runoff. Which brought with it pesticides. Soon birds began dying and algae bloomed in the once clear waters. Resorts closed or scraped by with reduced clientele. When powerful tropical storms ripped through the Imperial Valley in the mid-70s many packed up for good. Archived audio: Whacko: It used to be a real nice dinner house owned by Bill and Maxine McClaren. Huell Howser: What happened to it? Whacko: Eh, the floods. Huell Howser: Uh huh. Whacko: They kinda split up, well, actually it’s the floods what did it. Tamara Winter: By 2000, Salton City was far from being one of southern California’s major cities as the LA Times had predicted. In fact, its population shrank to less than 1,000. Most people who have heard of the Salton Sea are probably familiar with this era of its life - from the 70s to the present. In the popular imagination, it has existed for almost 50 years as a polluted, decaying, steadily salinating space populated either by die-hards left over from its boom years, or those looking for off-the-grid living in the surrounding desert. Less than an hour south of the sea, the unincorporated community of Slab City grew on the remains of a defunct military base. Artists, dropouts, and others seeking a life outside of mainstream society congregated in the desert in what is now affectionately referred to as “The Last Free Place in America.” When we visited Salton Sea, Everett made a trip out to The Slab and talked to some of the colorful residents. Wizard: Greetings and welcome to East Jesus! I am your mediocre half-assed tour guide. I don’t give tours. Tamara Winter: That’s Wizard. Wizard: I spend six months here and six months in India or Vietnam. Tamara Winter: If you meet him, his name makes a lot of sense. He’s got this long dusty gray beard that he’s clearly been growing for several decades and he speaks with the confidence of someone who could conjure a rabbit out of a hat. Wizard: This is a sheltered workshop for the work ethic impaired. They’re not lazy. They’re work ethic impaired. Tamara Winter: East Jesus is a massive collaborative art piece. Wizard: It’s a work of over 2,000 artists. And they would come here and they’d be inspired by the art. They would create art. Tamara Winter: It’s about 50 miles from where Everett’s family has their plot of land in Salton City. On the other side of the sea. But the environmental disaster at the sea touches both communities. As the sea evaporates in the baking desert sun, dust rises from the exposed lakebed. Wizard: The wind blows all this toxicity towards San Diego and LA and Imperial County doesn’t have the money to do anything but San Diego and LA does. If it affects them, they’ll do something about it. Archived audio: Sort of fine white powdery dust sits on top of the playa…and a very small wind will blow that and…I’ve been out here at times when it looked like a snow blizzard, you couldn’t see anything. Tamara Winter: Faced with looming environmental and human crises, the state of California has created commissions. Convened taskforces. And made multimillion—even multibillion—dollar promises to restore the sea. But these plans, some of which have been debated for almost two decades, have not changed the day-to-day reality for many who live in the area. Now the Salton Sea is at a crossroads. It is a potentially vast source of lithium - an essential ingredient in the batteries that power the green economy. Audrey Carleton: Lithium, it’s been called “white gold” it’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas. Tamara Winter: That’s Audrey Carleton. Audrey Carleton: I am an environmental journalist for Vice. I wrote this story on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote-un-quote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: Leading car companies are increasing the number of electric vehicles they can produce. Tesla made headlines last fall for having a market valuation greater than Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, Ford, and GM combined. But GM’s stated transformative goals set them apart. Audrey Carleton: General Motors is kind of paving the way. So, they made a first in the nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. Archived audio: Person 1: General Motors plans to stop making gas powered cars by 2035… Person 2: On the assembly line at this GM plant outside Detroit there are two things autoworkers…will never see again internal combustion engines, and gas tanks. Audrey Carleton: Because they are like the American automaker and they’ve made this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. Tamara Winter: Right now it’s estimated that almost 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United states come from transportation. So it’s understandable why GM’s plans are so ambitious. And their dedication to lithium mining is so strong. Audrey Carleton: They’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the EV space in doing so and in order to make that happen they’re going to need a lot of lithium so General Motors struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. Tamara Winter: Enter the Salton Sea. The US Department of Energy estimates that the sea could be the source of up to 600,000 tons of lithium. Per year. In fact, the Salton Sea is… Michael McKibben: …the largest brine source of lithium in the world. Tamara Winter: That’s Dr. Michael McKibben. He’s an Emeritus Professor of Geology at the University of California Riverside. He’s also one of the authors of a recent report on energy resources—including lithium—at the Salton Sea. To understand how lithium will be extracted at Salton Sea, we first need to talk about why it’s there in the first place. That’s a journey that starts millions of years ago, and thousands of miles away. The Colorado River snakes and curves across the southwestern United States passing through parts of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and finally California. The waters of the river have traveled that route for millions of years slowly eating away at sandstone and sediment. It was these waters that carved out the Grand Canyon. Over millennia the river carried all of the rock and mineral it eroded away. Occasionally, when hard rains fell, or there was heavy snowmelt in the Rockies, the river waters rose. And in southern California, the river would burst its banks and the parched Imperial Valley would be filled. Temporarily. The ancient lakes that formed became central to the lives and mythologies of the native peoples who lived in the area. Quechans, Chemehuevis, Cahuillas, and Kumeyaays gathered on the lake’s shores and fished their waters. The presence of these lakes can still be seen. The largest and most recent, called Lake Cahuilla, left what are called ‘bathtub rings’, or marks on the surrounding rockfaces indicating where its waters once stopped. Repeated flooding and evaporation over thousands of years left behind sediment full of minerals and trace metals, picked up as the river rushed from the Rockies to the sea. Among those metals: lithium. A lot of lithium. Dr. Michael McKibben explains just how much. Michael McKibben: Sort of back of the envelope calculation estimates I’ve done are somewhere on the order of two million to six million metric tons of lithium. Tamara Winter: A million, or six million, of anything is a lot, but Dr. McKibben puts those numbers into perspective. Michael McKibben: You know, even if we just produce a faction of it every year we could supply all US needs for lithium and actually have enough left over to export it to other countries. That would totally reverse the situation the U.S. is in where we’re now importing over 95% of the lithium we need. Tamara Winter: Right now, most lithium is mined outside the United States. Australia, Chile, Argentina, and China are all home to robust mining operations. But it’s not just the fact that the Salton Sea is in the United States that makes it such an attractive source of lithium. It’s the way lithium can be extracted. Right now, there are two common ways lithium is mined: open-pit, and evaporation. Open-pit mining is especially common in Australia. Archived audio: It’s vast and remote here in Pilbara and rich in minerals. Tamara Winter: Pilbara: sparsely populated and full of lithium. It’s home to growing mining operations. Archived audio: A new mine has recently opened here with the aim of becoming one of the biggest lithium mines in the world. Tamara Winter: That clip is from 2018. Since then, global demand for lithium has grown. And mining operations have become more and more lucrative. Archived audio: But we do things differently here. Mining hard rock lithium. Tamara Winter: In this type of mining, lithium-rich rocks are blasted apart. Pulverized. And soaked in sulphuric acid. Places like Pilbara are the ideal location for this kind of mining. It’s a region slightly larger than Iraq, but with barely more than 60,000 residents. But the pits still leave deep scars across the land. And acid runoff contaminates water supplies. The other type of mining used to collect lithium is evaporation mining. This practice is most common in South America and involves pumping groundwater from underneath dry lake beds and salt flats into enormous evaporation ponds. For example, the ponds at the Atacama salt flat form a checkerboard that stretches almost 30 square miles. In addition to taking up a lot of land, this type of mining uses large quantities of water in areas where it is already scarce. Indigenous communities near the Atacama salt flats have lost access to water and those opposed to mining fear for the fate of local wildlife if the mining operation continues. Archived audio: Sonya Ramos believes that lithium mining is killing this desert. A growing number of Chilean scientists agree and have come to the Atacama to join her campaign to stop it. Tamara Winter: So, the irony here is clear. Mining lithium—the metal that is crucial to a global transition to clean energy, can create environmental issues of its own. Added to this is another uncomfortable reality: currently the most developed nations in the world have the highest demand for lithium. But it’s sourced from some of the poorest. As Dr. Michael McKibben notes… Michael McKibben: We’re letting all the environmental problems occur in these other countries to satisfy our need for lithium. Tamara Winter: But this is where the Salton Sea comes in. The way that lithium will be gathered from the Imperial Valley is so different from open-pit and evaporation mining that Dr. McKibben hesitates to call it mining at all. Michael McKibben: The thing I worry about most is people understanding direct lithium extraction in the context of how lithium is mined elsewhere in the world. And that’s really our biggest challenge is we shouldn’t call it lithium mining at the Salton Sea—we should call it lithium extraction because it’s not mining in the traditional sense of the word. Tamara Winter: The process called direct lithium extraction involves using some of the green energy infrastructure already at the Salton Sea and repurposing it to collect lithium in addition to creating clean energy. There are already large scale geothermal energy projects at the Salton Sea. Everett and I saw some of them when we visited. Everett Katigbak: Maybe describe we’re seeing, Tammy. Tamara Winter: Okay, well this is a geothermal plant. It’s interesting…everything looks rusted by the way…it’s a lot larger than I thought when we were first driving in. You’ve got these giant, round cylinders with scaffolding at the top I guess. Tamara Winter: They draw hot saline brine, rich in metals and minerals, to the surface. As the brine is brought up, the change in pressure causes it to boil. The steam from the brine turns turbines creating electricity. Usually the brine and the recondensed steam are pumped back into the ground so the process can begin again. Direct lithium extraction basically places a filter on this process. Using other elements to draw the lithium out of the brine after it has already been brought to the surface. Then the brine, minus some lithium, is pumped back into the ground. Geothermal electricity is created. Lithium is extracted. And the only remnants are the brine and water. The potential for geothermal energy and lithium extraction at Salton Sea is especially promising because of California’s green energy goals. Michael McKibben: So California is now legislatively mandated to have its electrical grid be based on all renewables by 2045. And so that means we need more geothermal energy to satisfy that requirement and we need more lithium storage batteries to store electricity. Tamara Winter: This new commitment to renewables means that California is ready to invest in more geothermal energy. The state—famously situated on a fault line—has huge geothermal potential. But geothermal has long played third fiddle to wind and solar because of the high cost of building power plants. Now, as California works to decarbonize, the growth in demand for geothermal energy could provide an influx of well-paying jobs and political attention to the Imperial Valley. Michael McKibben: The state public utilities commission just asked for 1000 megawatts more of geothermal energy and the only place that can be supplied by really is the Salton Sea geothermal field. So they may have to double or triple the number of geothermal powerplants down there over the next decade to satisfy the demand for renewable energy. Tamara Winter: This could be an avenue to even more green industry. More geothermal plants means more potential for lithium extraction. But extraction is only the first step. Currently almost 80% of lithium ion batteries are made in China. If lithium extraction at the Salton Sea is successful, it is entirely possible that the area will become the ideal location for large scale domestic battery production. All of this potential is politically attractive. Presidents from both parties have championed the idea of “energy independence” for decades. Archived audio: Gerald Ford: Good evening. Last January 15th I went before your senators and representatives in congress with a comprehensive plan to make our country independent of foreign sources of energy by 1985… Archived audio: Ronald Reagan: ...technologies and more independence from foreign oil. Archived audio: George H. W. Bush: ...there is no security for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil. [Cheering] Archived audio Bill Clinton: I have repeatedly called in this campaign for more energy independence for America… Archived audio: George W. Bush: One of the greatest results of using hydrogen power of course will be energy independence for this nation. Archived audio: Barack Obama: We are closer to energy independence than we’ve ever been before… Archived audio: Donald Trump: We have energy independence right now… Archived audio: Joe Biden: …quote “energy independent” which is a phrase that’s thrown around… Tamara Winter: Energy independence. A political catch phrase that is so popular because it can mean, well, almost anything. Does it mean opening up protected lands for oil drilling? Expanding fracking operations? Investing in wind power and solar arrays? Well, depending on who is speaking it could be any of those. Or all of them. But the underlying desire for stable, domestic sources of energy makes a lot of sense. And as the globe transitions to green energy, the benefits of significant domestic production of lithium and lithium batteries will only grow. The question remains: will lithium extraction do what no other industry has accomplished and bring political attention and well-paying jobs to the Imperial Valley? Archived audio: Infrastructure turned this desert into productive farmland, but young people…worry that there’s no political will to help this delicate ecosystem and the families who live here. Tamara Winter: For decades the communities near the Salton Sea have heard government promises of investment. And while there is a lot of hope about what lithium extraction could mean, there is also some understandable suspicion. Archived audio: Person 1: Anecdotally after windy days we see a lot more asthma patients coming in. Person 2: Myself and my family developed asthma while living here. Tamara Winter: Childhood asthma rates are more than twice as high in the area around the Salton Sea than in the rest of California. As the sea continues to shrink… Archived audio: This area used to be water…but now obviously it’s dry here and the shoreline is hundreds of yards in this direction. Tamara Winter: …more and more fine dust particles are exposed. And risk rises. The hope is that, through lithium extraction, not only will the area receive an economic boost, but that efforts to restore the area will also gain attention and urgency. Roy Durantes: For a very long time the state was the number one entity working to restore the Salton Sea and to be honest with you things were going very slow. Tamara Winter: Roy Durantes is a former news producer and the founder of a group called “Saving the Salton Sea.” He’s also the director of the Salton Sea Film Festival, which gives local youth the opportunity to document their experiences of the area. Roy Durantes: I am not an expert. I am just a concerned resident. I know some people who suffer asthma. And one of my very close friends had some asthma seizures. The playa dries, all these contaminants that have been dormant there for practically 100 years could dry up and become airborne could become dust and go into the region and into people’s lungs. Tamara Winter: Durantes worries that the speed of the state’s response does not match the rate at which the environmental disaster is escalating. Roy Durantes: If you look at the playa exposure. This thing, man, is drying. It’s almost like in a race to dry up and we’re in a race to stop it from drying up because we don’t want to turn this into a ghost town. Tamara Winter: But there are still open questions around what lithium extraction will mean for the Imperial Valley. One thing is certain: lithium operations will grow in coming years. Global demand is expected to rise by over 800% in the next decade. So as this new layer of energy infrastructure is being created, it’s important to ask the right questions. At the Salton Sea, an area that has seen economic and political promise come and go, all these questions are playing out in real time. As Dr. McKibben explains… Michael McKibben: So part of the challenge to the geothermal companies and then those of us who are doing research down there is to educate the public about what’s going on and to help them understand that this is not traditional lithium mining that we’re talking about. Tamara Winter: A little bit like the L.A. Times in 1966 envisioning the area as the next Palm Springs, there is a potentially thrilling future in the making at the Salton Sea. One where lithium extraction is a success, battery factories are built, well-paying jobs flood the Imperial Valley like the Colorado River waters, and the environmental crisis at the Sea is contained. That’s a future Roy Durantes can see. Roy Durantes: What’s important is the thousands of families who are here. The thousands of kids, the thousands of people. My hope for the area is that the Salton Sea is restored so that it becomes a place of business. A place of industry. A place of recreation. A place of economy. A lot of us are very expectant and very hopeful. We want to see something happen. We want people to bring in solutions. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press.

To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and more, visit press.stripe.com That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the second episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Audrey Carleton. She is an environmental journalist and multimedia producer who writes for Motherboard, the science and technology arm of VICE. She covers all aspects of the global transition to green energy. In our conversation she discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea. She also draws on her experience covering the oil and natural gas industries to help explain why local environmental and social justice groups have reservations about the lithium operations. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Audrey Carleton. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, why are we talking today? Audrey Carleton: So we’re talking today because a couple of months ago, General Motors, which is America’s car maker, basically, struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. For context GM made this first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, they’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the, in the EV space in doing so. And in order to make that happen, they’re gonna need a lot of lithium. So they have staked out this area with Controlled Thermal Resources in Southern California called the Salton Sea which is a really interesting place because it’s this very toxic, very salty lake. It’s, it’s just a interesting place. And there’s a lot of kind of sociopolitical dynamics going on here, but essentially the goal is to mine for lithium using existing geothermal power plants and use that lithium to create EV batteries and achieve this goal of, you know, being all electric by 2035. Tamara Winter: So you recently wrote about Salton Sea. Tell me a little bit about that. Audrey Carleton: So back in July, I wrote this story for Motherboard on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote unquote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, what is the Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So the Salton Sea is not actually a sea. It is sort of a lake. And it’s kind of an accidental one. It was created in 1905 as kind of like an offshoot of the Colorado River. So essentially the Colorado River spilled out of its irrigation system into this one kind of reservoir in the very southern tip of California near Baja. It’s also kind of near Joshua Tree, if you’re familiar with that area. It sits around 200 feet below sea level. And it doesn’t have an outlet. So there’s, you know, water kind of flows into it from the Colorado River, but it doesn’t flow out of it. So it just kind of sits there and the way that the water level is managed is water kind of evaporates off of it. And that process leaves behind a lot of salt and a lot of minerals. So it’s become, over the years, incredibly salty, I think somewhere around 50% saltier than the Pacific Ocean. So it’s not the most habitable place for animals or people. It’s in the middle of the desert, but you know, it’s, it’s a really kind of interesting, interesting area from a social kind of demographic standpoint. I believe the last numbers I saw on unemployment in the region were around 20%. So pretty high. So, you know, I think we could call this in, in one future day, if, if this does become a real lithium hub I think it will be a place where environmental justice questions are like really at the forefront of who’s involved in the economic boon that this creates, who kind of benefits from it and who is potentially harmed. I think there are a ton, a ton of interesting questions, all kind of hovering around this area. And after I published this story for VICe, I will admit, this is probably the one story that has gotten me the most, the most response, because this is like an extremely hot button controversial issue. Tamara Winter: I want to get back to some of that after we set some context for folks who may not be familiar with things like what lithium even is and why Salton Sea is, is so toxic. So Audrey, what is lithium? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Great question. It is an element, you might remember it from the periodic table and it is a key ingredient in lithium ion batteries. So specifically, it’s extremely conductive. What that means is it has an extra electron on its outer shell and that electron because it just has the one it wants to be moving around and glamming onto other elements and creating bonds and in bouncing around so much, it creates an electrical current. So it’s highly conductive and when it’s shoved into batteries, it makes, you know, a really strong electrical current. It’s also unbelievably flammable. So these lithium battery fires are kind of a growing issue that we’ve also been working on at VICE. It’s, it’s because it’s so conductive, it’s really hard to put out and fires kind of spread in this crazy way because this one electron just wants to glam onto other things and they can be really hard to control. That’s a little bit tangential, but you know, lithium is, it’s been called white gold. It’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas because we need batteries in order to create electric vehicles and to create battery storage. Batteries will be the key to holding onto the energy that’s generated from wind and solar. In, you know, in kind of building up that infrastructure. It’s super important. I mean, one of the main kind of counterpoints that people always say about wind and solar is, well not everywhere is windy and the sun is only out for half the day, less than that during wintertime. So how are we going to, you know, generate constant energy storage or have sort of a constant, reliable energy source if these things are not around for, if they’re only around for a short amount of time and the answer is, is batteries you generate electrical current and you store it into a battery and then that’s, you know, used for later, but we need to be creating batteries and mining for minerals or elements like lithium in order to do that. And, you know, lithium’s a crucial one and it’s got a, gotten a lot of attention, but there are other elements that have kind of been that are like essential to battery creation too. Like cobalt. But it’s sort of the big one. Tamara Winter: How is lithium mined typically? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Yeah. So Lithium’s kind of an interesting element. It doesn’t exist in a pure state in the earth. That’s usually glommed on with you know, another element. So it’s often mined in this process called open-pit mining, and thisrefers to the kind of technique for mining. And that’s used also in like coal mining and mining for lots of other things, but specifically with lithium, essentially what happens is a few feet of earth is dredged up. Usually open-pit is used and with open-pit mining, this is usually done with whatever the mineral or element that is being mined is pretty close to the surface of the earth. So you just kind of just dig up some earth. A few feet, few hundred feet. And create an open space, and that will make way for the minerals that you’re looking for. This process is done with coal mining for example, this is the same process that leads to mountaintop removal which is extremely controversial and really environmentally destructive. But with lithium mining, it’s, you don’t quite have to go that deep, it often creates these sort of flats. They kinda look like salt flats. You may have seen, you know, like these aerial images of lithium mines, they’re these kind of vast greenish whiteish kind of, honestly like really beautiful looking mines. And what happens is when that earth is dredged up, it gives way for this sort of salty, muddy briney stuff that then the water is evaporated off of it. And that leaves just the minerals behind. And then those are distilled and lithium is taken from it. And this is done typically, I mean, there’s, this is sort of a new thing for the U.S., but there’s this one region in South America called the lithium triangle in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. And there’s these massive lithium mines there. And that’s sort of the process there is open-pit mining and the one consequence to this, the few consequences to this is that it’s very water intensive, it creates a fair amount of mineral waste. And, you know, the health consequences of being around open-pit mines are sort of unknown. There’s this one lithium mine in Nevada, in this region called Thacker Pass that’s gotten a lot of attention and been very, very controversial because it would sort of require doing this same process and dredging into this one mountain. And you know, I think a lot of concern around this process is valid because we just, you know, it’s relatively new, we just don’t know a ton about it. So we, it’s sort of, it’s sort of like a new frontier, like a new unknown, what, what it’s gonna, you know, what kind of consequences it’s gonna hold for the people who work in this industry and the people who live nearby it. Tamara Winter: And I am gonna jump out of order here, but I’m curious how CTR’s process differs from open-pit mining. Audrey Carleton: Yeah, sure. So, Controlled Thermal Resources has proposed a slightly different process from the typical sort of open-pit mining process. The Salton Sea is already home to a number of geothermal plants so those are power plants that take heat and steam from deep beneath the earth. It’s kind of the same heat and steam that you might see in a geyser, and it’s a renewable resource. I mean, we will always have these stores of heat underneath the earth. And you know, these geothermal mines take this up and generate energy from it and then pump that back into the earth. So it’s renewable. What CTR has proposed is taking brine as a byproduct of these power plants and extracting lithium from it, and then sending that same water back into the earth. So it’s essentially taking a byproduct of an existing energy generation process and taking a mineral out of it and then returning what was already going to be going back underground into the earth. The company has been firm that this process is less water intensive and less wasteful. And generally just kind of better for the environment than open-pit mining and requires a lot less in terms of land use. Because that’s another thing with mining is that it uses a ton of land and you know, like maybe years down the line, we’re seeing this with coal mines, at least in the infrastructure package, there’s sort of a push to reforest old coal mines and that’s possible, but it takes a lot of work. And so that’s one, one other consequence of, of traditional mining is just how much it takes in terms of land. And you know, that is land that takes a lot of work to get it back to the way that it was or if you even can get it back to the way that it was. So, you know, this process kind of takes advantage of existing infrastructure. But that said, I mean, they’re still working out the kinks of what exactly this is gonna look like and, and what they need to build and what they need to create in order for, you know, this, this lithium valley or this, they calling it ‘hell’s kitchen’. This region of California to become a real lithium mining area. They’re still kind of working out what that’s gonna look like in terms of infrastructure. So the land use question is kind of still, it’s still there. Tamara Winter: And I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but I’m going to ask it again. What companies right now are really interested in mining lithium in Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So General Motors is kind of the big one that’s staking its claim in this region, but California has created a commission, the Lithium Valley Commission, to kind of oversee the process and turn this area into the home of an industry. I think of it as like a second Silicon Valley, because the names are so similar, but General Motors is kind of paving the way. So they made a first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, because they’re like the American automaker and you know, they’ve made this, this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time, they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. It’s going to say, if this works, it’s going to say to other automakers, look, we can do this, here’s how you can do it as well, we can live in an electric vehicle country, you know, within, within a reasonable amount of time. And it could turn this area into a real hotbed. It could really make this part of California, like an actual lithium valley, you know? So I think it’ll be interesting to see what happens. But we’re still a couple years away from that because the deal, you know, with this one mine is still kind of being figured out. Tamara Winter: Why is it so important to mine more and more lithium? Why is there particularly such interest right now? Audrey Carleton: Yeah. That’s a great question. So lithium is a crucial element in the creation of batteries. And batteries are going to be essential in the transition away from fossil fuels because they hold on to energy that can be, you know, kind of created at any time and they make broadly speaking, they make renewable resources more reliable and more sustainable. Wind and solar are often kind of critiqued as being unreliable resources because the sun only shines for a certain amount of time every day and the wind is not everywhere, not all parts of the world are windy, and the wind doesn’t blow all the time. It doesn’t blow at the same speed. So how can we rely on these resources? Well, the answer is with batteries. By taking that energy and storing it somewhere, we have it to use for later during periods when it’s nighttime or periods, when it’s, there’s not as much of wind as a resource, we have that energy that we can rely on. With electric vehicles specifically, what that means is that each car has a battery and that gets plugged into a charger, but the energy that that charger pulls from the grid can come from any number of resources. So it’s kind of a mix right now. It could come from oil and gas. It could come from renewables, but the goal is to transition the entire energy grid to renewables and be able to pull energy from that and store it in cars with batteries. Batteries are essential for everything for the broader kind of transition to renewables. They’re essential for cars because they eliminate the likelihood that you’re using fossil fuels to power your car, because the energy that you’re pulling and storing in that battery could come from any number of things. As long as it’s energy, it can be stored in a battery, essentially. It’s just electrical current. Tamara Winter: Are there environmental risks to lithium mining? Audrey Carleton: I mean the main things are the land questions, the land use questions and also the water that’s required. And the waste. So those are the three big ones is that it’s this process that just requires a lot of water to generate, you know, to pull minerals out of these briney kind of flats. And it, you know, requires a ton of land. A lot of land has to be staked out to create these mines. And in, you know, like Thacker Pass that’s land that’s on the top of a mountain. It’s also land that is on and near Indigenous communities. So that’s very, you know, valuable, culturally valuable and really, really important land. It’s the water, it’s the land and it’s the waste. There’s a lot of mineral waste that’s generated in this process as well. So, you know, CTR, Controlled Thermal Resources aims to kind of cut those out of the process by just using a byproduct of existing infrastructure. But it’s also kind of a new technology that they have created. Tamara Winter: And who lives in and around Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: The community around the Salton Sea is fairly low income. Historically on average, there are a lot of Latino communities in that region. And this would be, if this goes well, and the jobs were given to people in this community, it would be a real boon. I think from what I gauged when I was reporting on this story there is a fair amount of distrust because there were some solar projects that went up in the region a few years ago that did not end up having the jobs go to the community. That’s sort of historically how these things go. I mean, solar’s a little bit different and renewables we’re still kind of learning, but with oil and gas projects, often what happens is, you know, a pipeline will go up or oil wells will go up, or drill rigs. And the people who work on those rigs are often not people from the community. They are people who work for the company and travel around and go from region to region. And so that’s how you sort of hear about these like abandoned or these sort of ghost oil towns in, you know, in the Permian Basin in Texas is, the industry will kind of move into a region. It will be a huge boon that helps all sectors of life. I mean, the value of everything goes up when there’s a resource like this that’s so valuable and, and becomes such a part of the economy. Everything from like haircuts to like how much your coffee costs, everybody’s just making more money for that short amount of time. But then once that resource dries up, those workers move away, they go onto a new place. That’s also how you hear about these, these sort of man camps of workers who kind of move into this region and work for a period of time and then move to the next one with their company. That’s sort of the trajectory that we’ve seen with fossil fuels. I think there’s still a lot that we’re seeing around the construction of all renewable infrastructure, including mines for elements like lithium. But I think the number one concern that anybody has when something like this pops up in their region is who’s going to be benefiting from it. And if this doesn’t become something that could lift up the community around the Salton Sea and flow cash into it and really become an economic boon for that region and the people that have lived there for decades then it’s kind of like, who’s it for? What are the consequences, what are the trade offs, what’s being sacrificed in order to make this happen? And, you know, if this mining typically is not great, I mean, mining is like kind of a dangerous, dangerous process. Coal mining we have seen comes with like countless health consequences and lithium mining is still kind of being studied, but you know, if there are harms and those harms are kind of inflicted on the people who live in that region, but at the same time, they’re not really given, you know, the local jobs then that’s like a really unfortunate trade off. That’s a really, really unfortunate situation. And it would be kind of an injustice for that to happen. Fortunately, it’s looking like that’s not going to be the process, but I think that is the fear. And so, you know, the folks that I talked to when I was reporting this story out said that people in the community hadn’t really been informed of the mines going up, but were open to being part of that. If it was something that was, that proved to be kind of a financial boon for the region. But you know, they just kind of want to have a stake in the process. And that’s why this Lithium Valley Commission is so important. It’s kind of a multi-stakeholder body. It’s got you know, folks from the company. It’s got folks from the local government in Imperial County in California. It’s got a couple of members from like local community development organizations and nonprofits on it. So it really does have a lot of different voices at the table. And you know, I think if this mine comes also with something like training programs for folks who live in the region and you know, kind of job development programs, then we could see this be something that really does benefit the whole community. But you know, that’s, I think the nuances of that are still are still being worked out. And the one government official who I spoke to in Imperial County when I was reporting this story out, said that so far, you know, I asked him like, does it seem like, you know, the voices of people who live in this region are really gonna be heard, like who has more say, you know, on this, on this panel. And he was like, well, everybody’s getting along for now, so… which is good looking out in the future, but we’ll see. I mean, there’s just any number of directions this could go. Tamara Winter: Wow. Audrey Carleton: I think a lot about the term like ‘sacrifice zone’ which is one that’s commonly used to talk about oil and gas projects. And even in Brooklyn, there was this pipeline that went up, has gone up over the last couple of years. And that term was kind of used a lot, was like you know, this region is a ‘sacrifice zone’ for this infrastructure. With pipelines it’s a little bit different because it’s kind of like, you know this infrastructure just runs through your area, but it doesn’t really create any jobs other than the jobs that are required to build it in the first place. But then once it’s built, it’s kind of built. With a mine it’s a little different because I think you know there’s a more steady kind of flow of work involved in that process. But yeah, I mean, nothing is really guaranteed and we see this all the time with fossil fuel projects where, you know, there’s been some semblance of input from a local community that for example, like really needs funding for education or really needs funding for a certain, you know, social good. And so when they get the chance to kind of tap into something like, you know, some sort of resource that’s really, really lucrative then they’ll often, you know, leaders will ultimately decide to say yes to it, but it’s a trade off. Because it does come with health consequences and then often that, that doesn’t end up panning out the jobs.There’s no commitments or no contracts that say the jobs have to go to people who live in that region. So these are kind of promises that are often made in the first kind of planning stages of a project, but aren’t ever really kept. That’s not to say that’s always what happens, but it is a very distinct possibility with any project that you know, it’s not that this trade off ends up being like the people who live here and have lived here forever, and for whom this is really their home and their community, they don’t get any of the benefits of this. In fact, they just get an influx of people from outside who come and that can lead to all kinds of things. It can lead to displacement/ I mean if we compare this to the Silicon Valley and look at the displacement that happened in Northern California as a result of that. You know, that’s a distinct possibility here. But mostly, I mean, when I think about these things, I think about the health impacts cause there’s pretty much no form of resource extraction that comes without any kind of health consequence for the people who live near it, whether that’s like air pollution in particulate matter and asthma or you know, ingesting like runoff and toxins that have leached into your waterways. Like all of these things come with consequences. And so if it were to be that the community and the Salton Sea only kind of gets those negative consequences and none of the benefits, none of the economic benefits that they’re saying, you know, they’re expressing interest in, that they’re saying that they want, then, that would be like a huge injustice. But I mean, if I’m being frank, I think it’s one that like a company like General Motors would be able to get away with because oil and gas companies have been doing this kind of thing for years. And there’s only recent attention to environmental justice as a concept. But you know, there’s nothing that would, I don’t know, I guess I’m just cynical. I think that the company would probably be able to get away with it. Tamara Winter: I don’t know if I totally disagree, you know, I hope that people will keep writing about it and talking about it. And I do wonder if the tide is turning a little bit. But yeah, I don’t, I don’t know if we have like full, like a hundred percent reason to be optimistic. I know, I’m going to wind get this down and basically just ask you one, is there anything that I, that you think is really important that I, or listeners of the podcast should know that we haven’t talked about? Audrey Carleton: I feel like we’ve covered a lot of stuff. We’ve covered a fair amount of ground. I would say, I just think this is going to be a new, massive frontier in kind of the energy transition. There are probably going to be mines popping up all over the place and other mines. I mean, this one is not as controversial, but the Thacker Pass Mine in Nevada has become like wildly controversial and sort of represents this new intense kind of question of like, what are we willing to sacrifice in order to get to a renewable economy and whether we can kind of maintain the scale of consumption that we’re at and still, you know, avert the climate crisis. Like I think that this question around lithium is so interesting from an environmental perspective, but also weirdly like a philosophical one because you know, we have certain needs that we, as a species have gotten used to having like heat and electricity and cars and the ability to travel and the ability to shop and go places and mail people things. And if we want to maintain that, we’re gonna need an energy source, but no energy source comes without consequences. So it’s kind of just about minimizing those things. And I think this is a really interesting time to be looking at this right now because it’s so new, but I think that we are only going to continue to see more mines and more protests and more lawsuits against companies that are aiming to mine. And I also really staunchly believe that if we want to see a just transition, that means that we cannot treat people and the earth in the way that the fossil fuel and the coal industry has treated people and the earth. And, you know, those processes of permitting plants and permitting drill rigs and stuff and oil wells historically have been rife with violations and like, you know, like bad things happen in oil fields every day. There is illegal dumping all the time, you know, like this is a really, really difficult space to regulate. And I think if we want, you know, our new renewable economy to not come with some of those negative things, we need to hold these companies that are leading it to account. And so I think this is gonna be just like a really interesting sign of where we’re at in terms of that to see, how the creation of these minds play, plays out. And I think it’s like a really interesting, the Lithium Valley Commission and this one community and, you know, the kind of dynamics, the political dynamics at play here are really kind of interesting litmus test of that. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. Audrey, thank you so much for this. I learned a ton. I read your article, which is fantastic, but I learned a ton in just talking with you. So I’m so grateful that you took time to chat with me. I really appreciate it. Audrey Carleton: Yeah. Thank you so much. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our associate producer and editor was Astrid Landon. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and a whole lot more, visit press.stripe.com. Alright, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: The global supply chain is like an industrial ballet. An intricately choreographed dance of manufacturers, distributors, and transportation infrastructure that physically moves materials and products across the globe. However just like a ballet, when one dancer stumbles - the whole production can go sideways very quickly. Archived audio: This is what the traffic bottleneck looks like at the ports of LA and Long Beach. Tamara Winter: In the fall of 2021, with holidays fast approaching, a record number of ships sat waiting just off of the Port of Long Beach, California, unable to unload billions worth of cargo. Fifty miles north in Malibu, the pristine coastline looked more like the area’s notoriously congested freeways. Cargo ships also stretched south, some 100 miles or so towards San Diego, not too far from the border of Mexico. Archived audio: The backup is mostly due to a surge in imports because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tamara Winter: Online sales increased more than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic, and continued to rise throughout 2021. Local lockdowns, and physical constraints on workforces, compounded the problem until, in the lead up to the holidays, it reached a breaking point. Archived audio: The complex delays at the nation’s busiest ports, accounting for 40% of the country’s container traffic, affects consumers from coast to coast. Tamara Winter: One person monitoring the situation closely was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a technology platform for global logistics. When he heard the news stories about the backlogs at California ports, he took action. He hired a boat, toured the ports, and then he took to Twitter. In 30 tweets he laid out his five-point plan to ease the bottleneck. Soon he was on the phone with California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia was implementing some of his recommendations. So how does someone end up writing what came to be known as “the tweetstorm that saved Christmas”? Welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press all about big ideas in infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter and today we are sitting down with Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen to understand how he thinks about trade, the way he understands the intersection of government and technology, and why he founded Flexport in the first place. We cover a lot of ground talking about everything from ancient trade routes to what Flexport is doing to help during the present crisis in Ukraine. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Ryan Petersen. Tamara Winter: This is a really long time coming. I almost feel like the hipsters, like I knew you before, my dad was reading like cover stories about you. People now know you for donating lots of money to Ukraine or saving Christmas, but some of us, some of us have been here before that. Maybe we’ll start with what is Flexport? Ryan Petersen: Well, Flexport is a technology platform for global logistics. We make it possible for companies of any size to ship anything anywhere. And simply that process try to bring kind of utility grade infrastructure to an industry that’s kind of taped together by duct tape and emailed Excel files and PDF attachments and stuff. And we can make this seamless, our mission is to make global trade easy for everyone, but we want to make trade so easy there will be more trade as a result of when we’re finished. 20 years ago, I ran a small business buying products and China and selling them on the internet and was very frustrated by my experience, dealing with logistics and felt just like…George Bernard Shaw says every profession is a conspiracy against the laity. And it felt like that, like anytime I dealt with these companies, it just seemed like there was, nobody could tell me where my stuff was, how much it was gonna cost, whatever they told me, ended up costing more, a lot of really confusing paperwork, regulations, documents that were needed, data that needed to be collected and shared with the governments and stuff. And it just, nobody was there to hold my hand and make this easy for me. And it’s an industry full of code words, acronyms and Viking English, weird language is used all the time. And kind of like an all boys club, literally an all boys club, there’s lot of men working in this industry. And like, it’s very hard to parse as an outsider. When you’d ask someone to explain it to you—my working model now that I’ve kind of been on the other side is that I think that the industry treats these words, these acronyms, this lingo, as kind of a rookie detector. And it’s kind of icky. Like I want to work with companies that just want help people. And it should be a really fun industry. You get to help entrepreneurs, you get to help businesses achieve their goals, right? But it’s so important. Like we probably lifted a billion people outta poverty in the last 50 years through free market economics and adoption of global, free trading type policies around the world. And yeah, it’s like, here’s something that’s really important, interesting in my view, fun and really broken. It’s like, it’s a good heat map for where you should go work and what you could, what, where you could like build a career and do something interesting. Tamara Winter: In a word, the thing that you’re fixing is transaction costs, it’s funny. I was born in Nigeria and every time I go back, my mom’s like, “Look, if we’re at the market, don’t say anything”, because as soon as I do, it’s like, you sound like an NPR host, I’m immediately gonna charge you, you know, 40% more or whatever. Ryan Petersen: This is when you go back now? Tamara Winter: Yeah, exactly. Right. Ryan Petersen: How old were you when you left Nigeria? Tamara Winter: Two months. I just want to get into, you know, you live and breathe logistics so much so that, tell me about your daughter’s Halloween costume last year. Ryan Petersen: Well, my wife gets all my credit for this. We dressed my daughter, she made a wagon into a container ship, like a little radio flyer wagon, and made it into the Evergiven container ship. And we dressed my daughter like a sailor and had her drive, you know, ride around and pulled her around in that thing. And we even at some point blocked traffic with it. Tamara Winter: [laughs] But I’m sure nobody minded because it’s like this beautiful little girl just being driven around. Ryan Petersen: It was super fun. Tamara Winter: Tell me about, so we talked about, why you started, how you got to starting Flexport, but I wanna go back even earlier. What was your upbringing like? How does somebody raise a child that goes on to, you know, I don’t know, save Christmas? Ryan Petersen: [laughs] Saving Christmas. So my mom is an entrepreneur actually. And she’s an expert on food safety and like regulations, the intersection of food safety and government regulations. So helping companies to comply with food safety regs and, and build healthier food supply chains. I do kind of think she raised my brother and I to be entrepreneurs. We used to get our allowance by delivering sodas to her office. And like we had to sell them, we would buy the sodas at Safeway or something, sell them to her office and make, you know, make a spread. Tamara Winter: [laughs] And then that was your allowance? Ryan Petersen: Yeah, that was how we got allowance. It was good money. She allowed us to overcharge her for the sodas. We’d go to Costco and buy, blow pops in bulk. And I’d sell them to all the other kids in my middle school. I don’t think at the time I was thinking about entrepreneurship, obviously, she never talked to me about that, but both my brother and I became entrepreneurs. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting how many parallels there are to different parts of the series, but the very first episode with Mwiya who is building a city in Zambia, his father was like one of the chief architects of Zambia’s finance ecosystem, but his mother was an entrepreneur. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, my mom’s a huge influence on me. My brother’s probably even more so. My brother’s a born entrepreneur too. And, when I graduated from college, I didn’t have a lot of prospects for gainful employment. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: I don’t know, I went to UC Berkeley. I was really interested in international development. The question of like, why are some countries poor and some countries rich? Tamara Winter: You didn’t want to become an economist? Ryan Petersen: I didn’t have the skillset for that. And then no, I didn’t wanna do like a PhD in economics. Honestly, I’m very skeptical of it all. So my brother hired me working for this trading company. Tamara Winter: Is he older or younger? Ryan Petersen: My older brother, yeah. And he was a computer programmer at Intel and he was taking his salary and using it to buy stuff in China and sell it on the internet. Just like very entrepreneurial. This is, late nineties, early 2000. So there was a tech startup scene, but we weren’t part of that. It was like just a couple kids trying to make some money. Tamara Winter: And are you from Berkeley? Ryan Petersen: Bethesda, Maryland. Washington DC. Tamara Winter: So this is interesting because you are sort of like right in the heart of government. And you’re in Bethesda. And for anyone who’s listening, who doesn’t know about Bethesda, Bethesda is where sort of the children of bureaucrats grow up. Ryan Petersen: Well, my dad worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. My dad’s a computer programmer actually, wrote his first code that was like in production, in use in the seventies when he was working, it was actually evaluating Soviet defense. Eventually my mom started this business that does food safety and she needed software to evaluate risk of pesticides and applying like, okay, if we use this pesticide, what will happen based on the dietary data of the whole United States population? What’s the safety implications of various pesticides? And so he wrote that software. And that’s still the software that the U.S. government uses to evaluate pesticide risk assessment in the United States, is written by my father. Tamara Winter: So in some ways the marriage of government and technology or commerce is just like a very natural one for you. I’m curious about your philosophical influences. I mean, I’m hearing some like Hayek in what you’re saying. I was looking at some of the books that you recommended and I mean, they’re everywhere from The Goal to just like interesting philosophical read. So tell me, who are the sort of intellectual influences on how you think? Ryan Petersen: The thing I love about reading is like, if, if you’re reading good books, every good book you read should point you to like two or three more. I don’t think I ever really read a book by the way, cover to cover on my own until I was about 25 years old. I’m serious. I like hacked my way through college and like, you know, found the Cliff Notes or whatever. When I was 25, I was living in China and running this sort of business that would export products from China, studying Chinese in the morning and exporting products to sell in the United States. I was living there and all of a sudden books became incredibly scarce and I was kind of bored. I didn’t have that many friends. And so when, you know, there’s not a lot of English bookstores at that time. In the part of China I was living. So I would go to Hong Kong and buy like a backpack full of books and bring ’em back. And so that’s when I really became a reader. I think I read over, over like 75 books in one year that year. And it’s become a real passion of mine. The biggest influences, I think that the aha moments where I was like, whoa, this changed my worldview, probably like Richard Dawkins and reading The Selfish Gene and understanding something about evolution and genetics. And then building from that is a book that really changed my worldview is called Complexity, Waldrop is the guy’s name. And it’s about complex adaptive systems. And this idea of feedback thresholds of complexity, when a system has enough interacting parts that at some point there’s this threshold of complexity it reaches, and it has emergent properties and it changes. So take hydrogen and oxygen. It’s pretty simple, but if you put them together, at some point you get enough of these molecules together and you got the emergent property of wetness of water, but there’s nothing about hydrogen or oxygen that if you looked at them, you would say, oh, this will—there’s wetness here. Like, no, it happens at some level of complexity when you put enough of these together. And so that was the first book that set me on that. And the one that I found that I really recommend to people, it’s not a book, it’s an Audible course called Big History. And it’s the application of complexity theory to the history of the world starting at the Big Bang all the way to the present. And then when you start to see that you can apply that in business is when it gets really fun. And that many, you know, it’s many of these things are just fascinating to watch, be able to apply an idea from one discipline to another. I think that’s where you get the most innovation is taking an idea from biology and applying it to business. Society tends to create specialists. And I really like being a generalist, understanding a little bit about everything and then you get creativity because you’re putting ideas from different disciplines that no one ever thought to combine. And my most recent inspiration has been a guy named John Boyd who’s a military strategist and talks about, how do you manage volatility and chaos, which is something that the military has to be really good at. And what is, what are the attributes of an organization that in the middle of complete chaos fog of war, what’s going on here can still take decisive action and not be caught like in survival mode and fail. And I think that’s something I’ve been trying to apply a lot at Flexport because we’re in a lot of chaos all the time. And if we can make sure we’re still playing offense, like understanding what’s happening around us and taking decisive action and then learning based on our actions. Tamara Winter: Okay. Tell me about trade routes. Maybe you can paint a picture for me sort of about the evolution of modern logistics. Ryan Petersen: Oh wow. Oh, well trade is something there’s, there’s evidence of long distance trade between human beings that far predates even things like art. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Possibly predates language like 10, 50,000 or more years ago, you can, you can find evidence that humans were transporting things over a long distance. It goes for a really long time, even like the invention of the boat. The invention of the boat happened in like Mesopotamia, where what they were actually doing is transporting goods down river. And what they would do is build these wooden boats, cover them with animal skins so they could float down river and then scrap the boat, but keep the animal skins and hike back and do that over and over again. That was tens of thousands of years ago, like before agriculture, even. So this is an ancient, really ancient industry. I think you could probably date the more modern form with the age of exploration and sort of like Prince Henry, the navigator in Portugal. And actually you really wanna tie that to the Mongol invasions. So the Islamic empire kind of separated Europe from the east and they traded a lot, but the Islamic empires were in between and they were the middle man and they marked everything up like 10x and made a lot of money became rich doing that. And during the Mongol invasion, the Mongols came and defeated the caliphate in Baghdad and opened it up. And that’s where you get like Marco Polo, right, traveling to the east and kind of saw the riches of Asia and Europe for the first time was trading. And that was about a hundred year window when it was open. And then it came kind of crashing back down. The iron curtain of the Islamic empire came back and Europe was like, wait a minute. We, like, we just saw, all those riches we wanna get in on these like cheap spices and all the other stuff, the silks and everything. And so it started with the Portuguese trying to find a way around Africa and they started, this is like the original kind of like technology industry. They had to build all kinds of astronomic instruments to be able to tell where you are. It was about, I want to say 1350 is when they really started that program. And 1498 is when they rounded the horn of Africa and made it into India. Now, it’s not all beautiful. Like obviously there’s terrible things that happen. Like the first thing they did was kill a whole bunch of people who were on their way to the Hajj Islamic pilgrimage. It’s easy to kind of see yourself in these people. Especially as like a European descent person like myself, I’m like, oh yeah, I came from these people, but they were like really superstitious, very different types of people. They saw themselves in a holy war against Islam it was really, like reverse jihad crusade from the beginning. But very quickly they set up trading centers and the spices were like 1/1000th of price or something like that. Maybe, maybe that’s a bit, but it was so much cheaper if you could go to the source and not just in India, but all the way to the Spice Islands, which is, I think, modern day, the Malukus or Indonesia. And so it suddenly became very, very rich. It was kind of the original venture capital that if you sent a ship to the Malukus and it made it back, you made like eight extra money and yeah, only half the people made it back, but you still got four extra money. You know, only half the ships made it back. So that’s kind of the origin. And I think where it really comes to the next level is in the, I want to say like one of the Dutch East India Companies, the first joint stock companies, or the first public company you could buy shares in was a shipping company, the Crown of the Netherlands and later England and France to the certain extent gave monopolies on trade and in exchange for, the crown would take 20%, but then if you wanted a trade with the east, only this one company could trade. And so that was like 1700s, 1800s the East India Company, but there’s terrible things, of course: trading slaves, trading opium was big, we don’t want to pretend like all of the trade was always great and you do need regulations and there’s good reasons to have like all the rules that we have around trade today, but yeah, it’s a fascinating industry and it’s like really cool to be part of that today. Probably the most important thing, I would argue that the most important technology of the last 50 years is the shipping container. At least in terms of like lifting people out of poverty and unifying the world, creating globalization and yet, it hasn’t really changed. We still unload these ships one container at a time. It’s just like, there’s not a lot of innovation and it makes sense because it’s hard to change an organization, an institution, a way of doing things. Tamara Winter: That actually sort of beautifully dovetails into what I wanted to ask you next. You know, most people tend to think of supply chains from a consumer point of view, right? So you know, earlier this week I ordered my favorite version of Clif Bars, this is a peanut butter banana one, and you know, I press some buttons on Amazon and it comes to me. So that’s the typical way people think about supply chains, but can you talk about how the supply chain affects the economy more broadly? Ryan Petersen: Well, it’s the circulatory system for the economy. The supply chain can be a lot of things. It’s also the manufacturing and things, the raw materials, there’s a great paper called I, Pencil. You know what I’m talking about? I, Pencil? Tamara Winter: I love I, Pencil. For anyone who’s not listening, the founder of FEE, the Foundation for Economic Education. It’s a great essay about trade, about how a pencil gets made called I, Pencil. Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, yeah. And it’s basically the idea that like, there’s no human being that understands how you make a pencil and you couldn’t possibly make something simple as a pencil because you have to understand, okay, what is it made of? It’s got wood. It’s got like maybe rubber, some graphite in the middle and some kind of aluminum rapper. It’s like, okay, to make that, you need to understand how to cut down trees. Okay. How do you cut down a tree? You need a saw, okay, now I need to know metallurgy. It’s like right away, you give up. There’s no one, you know, of course there’s some people who know metallurgy, but now to make rubber, okay. I need to know how to grow rubber trees, do the little thing where they cut the slit in it, you know, capture the rubber, process it. The same for aluminum, same for graphite. And then create, I have no idea how they put the graphite inside the wood, but they have to do that too. It’s like, there’s no one who could do all of that. And then imagine that on an insane complexity of the modern economy, where everything is connected to everything else, and we all take it for granted. And that fundamentally it’s the supply chain. How does this connect to one another? How do we connect companies, people and the ideas that go into those products, right? Adam Smith has a great quote, he’s like, “I never saw a dog exchange a bone with another dog.” It’s something that only humans do. And we depend on it to an insane degree. It’s what advances civilization and progress because every time two people trade with one another, there’s a mutually beneficial exchange. And so value is created from that process. I give you something that you value more than what you gave me, I think it’s a foundational aspect of like, how we rise up as a human civilization, as a, human you know, species. I think it’s actually one of the dangerous things in globalization, is you lose kind of some of the uniqueness of different cultures and different civilizations and being uniquely good at something. Probably the most important economist, if not the most famous, is David Ricardo explained how this value creation takes place when two people trade. But if everybody has the same ideas, then all you get is like, oh, we have slightly different geographic attributes, geologic attributes, you have coal and we have timber or something. It’s not, not that interesting when all the ideas are the same. And you lose some of that if there’s cultural monotone, like all the civilizations have the same ideas. It’s not very interesting. I love to travel and I think I used to like to travel even more because the internet has kind of created a lot of monoculture. You can get avocado toast anywhere you want on planet Earth now, it’s like a sign elites are traveling in the neighborhood. I hate seeing avocado toast when I’m in some foreign country. And you know, you want to live in a world where there’s like more cultural diversity and I think it can lead to more interesting exchange of ideas and exchange of products and things. Tamara Winter: There’s a great Verge article that I think about constantly called Welcome to Airspace. And it’s all about the Airbnbification of everything. The last time I was in Zambia, I just tweeted pictures. Like, where do you think I am right now? And I got like, oh, Miami, San Francisco. And I was like, nope, I am in Lusaka, Zambia. And it looks like I’m in Miami. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. I bet you can get avocado toast there. Tamara Winter: You actually can. And you know what? The avocado toast was some of the best avocado toast I’ve ever had, I’m still thinking about that avocado toast. Alright, I’m ready to talk about Flexport. What is the problem that Flexport was created to solve? Ryan Petersen: It’s fundamentally that it’s too hard to buy products in another country and import them into a different country, ship them around the world, clear them through customs, get them delivered, where they need to go. And this is for businesses, like helping a company solve this problem that they shouldn’t honestly have to have this big bureaucratic department pushing paper to do the things, it should be automatic like, companies need to be really good at two things: make an awesome product that’s high quality at scale that people want—very, very hard, almost a nightmare to do that in this world—and then even harder in my view is be differentiated, like build a brand, a customer connection, sell the product. So supply and demand, right? It’s like the core attributes of a business. And if they’re doing all this other stuff like compliance and spending time on paperwork and shipping and routing containers and tracking things like, it’s not really value added work. It should be an automatic kind of utility scale, just reliable thing that’s out there. And that’s what we, that’s what we’re building. Very, very hard problem, because if you wanna ship a single, let’s call it a pallet of goods. Tamara Winter: Yeah, I actually would love you to walk me through, you know, if I’m, if I’m the, you know, the Clif company, what actually does it take to ship this from wherever it was made now I’m kind of scared, to me in, in New York. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and so if you’re, if you’re making well, let’s say—I don’t know enough about Clif Bars, so I don’t wanna speak to, that specific company, but let’s say you’re making a pallet of some new, like cool hardware company, maybe these headphones right here. And you’re trying, they’re probably made in Shenzhen or thereabouts, in Southern China. And if you were to try to get those products made and shipped in a smaller batch, let’s take, because I want to show you it’s very normal to ship like a pallet of stuff. It should be even more normal than it is, except it’s really hard. But let’s say we’re shipping a pallet. So we’re talking about like one meter cubed of stuff that needs to ship around the world and it’s going to be—okay, how many companies are gonna be involved in this transaction? I’m shipping this from, let’s say Shenzhen to St. Louis. Alright, I’ve got a pallet of stuff and it’s going to go by ocean freight to save money—air freight’s pretty expensive. I’ve got the factory that’s gonna pick these up. So I’ve got to send a truck to pick it up, bring it to a warehouse where it’s gonna be consolidated with other customers’ cargo, put into a container. I’ve got to find a container somewhere. I’ve got to then get another truck that takes that container to the port. A customs brokerage needs to clear it out of the port, out of the country. I’m now at seven companies involved in this transaction and I haven’t left the home country yet. Seven different companies. Put it on a ship is eight, clear it through customs on the other side of the world, bring it to the port, 10 companies, another truck picks it up, brings it to a warehouse. That’s 12 companies. Another truck brings it to your final warehouse for wherever it’s destined. I’m not even like in the store yet. Oh. And by the way, there’s a bank that’s providing a payment on this transaction, maybe it’s Stripe. There’s a insurance company that’s going to underwrite in case something gets lost or damaged in the way. So I’ve got like 13, 15 companies, very normal thing to have that. Tamara Winter: And I don’t even have my headphones yet. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Your headphones haven’t got to the consumer, right. And so warehouse pick, pack and delivery. Fundamentally the problems come about because everybody in this chain is operating off of like a very local set of data of what can they see about the transaction. And yet they’re dependent on each other in a chain. Humans have to be involved in some of it. Compliance is at stake. You can’t just ship anything across international borders for good reasons. Counterfeit, drugs, arms, people, who knows what can be shipped, right? So you need these regulations. And so that’s the fundamental problem is how do we get data to the company that needs to do something, connect with that asset, with that truck, with that ship, if there’s an asset involved, show them what to do. They need data to do their job. And then they have to tell us what they’ve done and share data back. And that’s, that’s fundamentally, what’s different. We call this business a freight forwarder. That’s what we call this industry that solves this problem. Because if you’re a startup making headphones, you definitely don’t wanna be dealing with 15 companies every time you ship your pallet of headphones. So you call a freight forwarder and then a freight forwarder deals with the complexity. I often joke it should called freight email forwarding because they basically just like email everybody and make it happen. And you don’t have to deal with that. What Flexport does differently is build interfaces, web interface, mobile interface, increasingly it’s about APIs and connectivity to software talking to software so that, that data can flow to and from these parties and get visibility at what’s happening, control over what’s happening, to help smooth that transaction, make it cheaper, make it faster. Hopefully we can route around disruptions in supply chain. We can find you better routings and cheaper, faster, more options and make that process better. Tamara Winter: You have had an inside look, more so than most, into what part of the supply chain has broken down in the past couple of years, you know, there’s the like sort of evergreen headline in this, in these unprecedented times. What in the supply chain broke down? Can you just help me understand that? Ryan Petersen: A lot of things, I mean, I think fundamentally what’s happened is that consumers really shifted their buying patterns rapidly overnight. When we all locked down and stop going to restaurants, hotels, bars, travel, all these things that are in the, what we call services, massages, like stuff that you just stop doing, tended to be services and we all shifted our spend onto goods. Income didn’t fall that much. A lot of people were out of work, especially if you worked in the services businesses, but the government really printed a lot of money and did a lot of stimulus. So people had money, money burns a hole in your pocket, you’ve got to spend it you know, you’ve got to get your dopamine somewhere. So people just kept buying stuff on Amazon and elsewhere, e-commerce went crazy. So you had this big shift from services onto goods and with all those goods purchases that just put incredible stress on our supply chain, manufacturing companies and couldn’t keep up. And so a lot of things kept breaking down. On logistics, it’s a simpler story. We just didn’t have enough infrastructure, not enough containers, not enough chassis—these are the trailers that haul containers—not enough drivers for the trucks, not enough container ships, the ports that we have didn’t have enough throughput to keep up with all the excess volume. So like volume of containers is up 20% over pre-pandemic levels. Things started to break down just by just not being able to keep up with the demand. Tamara Winter: I’m thinking back to when my poor dad had to sit through me and Swan Lake. I mean, if one thing goes wrong, if the Nutcracker, you know, falls, everybody falls. And, and it sounds like that is kind of a, there’s a similar level of fragility in our supply chain, which I don’t know that most people appreciated, because again, there’s a pencil right here. All you can see is, you know, the pencil that gets to you. And a lot of that complexity is just kind of hidden. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. And markets work like for the most part and the price mechanisms respond. And you gotta be careful what if the price goes way up for ocean freight, which it has, it’s like up five x or so over pre pandemic levels, and there’s a lot of push right now, Congress is trying to bring it back down through regulations. We’ve got more talk about price controls than we’ve had, like in my lifetime right now. And it’s pretty dangerous because that high price is a signal to market participants. Hey, there’s money to be made. If you can bring a ship to market, if you can build a ship and that’s how markets are supposed to function. So you take out the price mechanism and you will not get more goods in response to the demand. And like, what we need is more supply, and that’s what prices are for. So when prices go up, I know a lot of government politicians, or it’s popular to say, oh, corporations are greedy, but like, maybe so, but the mechanism is price is high. Oh, wait, there’s opportunity here. And people surge onto that. And that’s, it’s amazing. It is a ballet like that. It all works. And it works because of the price mechanism basically. But it’s also amazing that it works given how screwed up humans are, like human nature is pretty screwed up. And like the fact that it all works is kind of a miracle. Like people have all, we’re kind of like beasts inside and have all these crazy emotions and terrible things, yet the economy mostly works and it’s, we can call it fragile, but it’s been relatively resilient. Tamara Winter: Tell me about some of the misconceptions that people have about global trade. You’ve become kind of a go-to expert, like what are the sort of things people just get wrong over and over again? Ryan Petersen: The idea that trade is exploitative, I think is a really interesting one. Like you have this whole fair trade movement, which I don’t quite get because trade is like mutually beneficial exchange or the idea that someone’s being exploited here, doesn’t really add up to me. I think you do need really good regulations on like externalities, like environmental damage and there’s great reason to have rules, like to protect environment, and labor safety standards and things like this, child labor and all that. But like, that’s not a trade. That’s just like good governance. The trade aspect of like one company exchanging something for money on the other side of the world, that’s like, that is the heartbeat of wealth creation, value creation, the engine of prosperity. And so to take it away, I’ve found to be really dangerous. That’s like one criticism. I think the valid criticisms that I’m very much like really interested in or the stuff I was getting to earlier on like global monoculture. Like if it’s the same product sold everywhere on planet Earth, the Earth becomes less interesting. And it’s maybe that’s like a privileged white guy thing to say, because like, I want to go to Zambia and experience like Zambian culture and like, show me what Zambia is like and make it different. Whereas Zambian people are like, look, we’re trying to be less poor. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: We want to have a life like you have. And who am I to say like, oh, you can’t, I don’t want you to benefit from like Western nice things. I want you to live with the way Zambains always lived in my mind. Tamara Winter: Look, I didn’t wanna say it, but I, you know, I was thinking it, but I’ll tell you what, next time I go back to Nkwashi, I’ll take you with me. You’ve touched on this a lot, but I wanna ask you explicitly, you know, there’s an inverse relationship between trade and poverty. And I’m hoping you can offer some sort of like more examples of this and expand on that point a little bit, because it’s one that I believe really strongly. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and well, we’ve seen it over the last 50 years. I think China’s probably the best place we can point to where we lifted 600 million people or so from below the poverty line, it’s really an economic miracle. But it’s not unique to China. Korea’s a great example. Export led growth in Korea. Dubai is a more modern example where liberalization and opening things up and allowing trade to take place. I think it’s well rounded in economic theory, which I’m skeptical of, but in empirical data, you can just look and see that the countries that trade more, become more prosperous. And it’s a little dangerous in my view, there is nothing that says that all progress is up and to the right, Like we kind of think so, because we feel like we’re in a golden age and the world’s never been richer. And the graph of GDP is just like this amazing exponential curve. Four percent annual growth, but if you do it for 500 years, you get like an insane exponential curve. But that does not have to be the case. And if you look across 10,000 years of human civilization, there are these waves of progress and then collapse. And we’re right now at a crossroads where trade has not been so unpopular in a long time, you’ve got trade wars between China and the United States. You’ve got pretty much both parties in the United States, no longer supporting a free trading agenda. You’ve got war as we speak unfolding in Ukraine, which has made trade and economic sanctions into a weapon. I’m not necessarily arguing you shouldn’t do this, but we should talk about the consequences. Russia and Ukraine combined are number one and number five in grain exports. And Belarus is I think number one in fertilizer exports in potash. Take Africa over the last 40 years, Africa’s made huge amounts of progress at five x the output of food in the continent per capita over the last 40-50 years. But a lot of that’s dependent on fertilizer imports. And so if you suddenly remove all these fertilizer imports and that’s going to be even for the food sufficient nations, all of a sudden they might not be. And a lot of countries take Egypt or many Middle Eastern countries are net food importers and they buy a lot of grain from Russia and Ukraine. And if that’s removed from the market, food insecurity is what leads to civil war, famine, anarchy, right. And we’re on some level, we’re going to find out just how important globalization and trade is because we’ve taken it for granted. We’ve become incredibly dependent on it. And if you suddenly rip that carpet out, it’s almost, it’s a pretty unfair to these countries who were sold a bag like, hey, you’ll be able to get goods from anywhere. It’s very scary. I’m very worried about it. Tamara Winter: It’s really interesting because there are, you know, the first order effects that I think even those, I don’t know that they’re very well understood. But the second order effects I think are really poorly understood. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and the second order effects, third order effects. I mean, it’s really anyone who thinks they could predict all of this. I have no idea, but very few people predicted, like realized that actually the governments really aren’t nearly as important as the people in the west and in the social media world, just reacting. And then every company feeling like, oh, we can’t do business in Russia anymore. Tamara Winter: Right? Like Coca-Cola. Ryan Petersen: Even if we’re allowed to legally, we just can’t, and backing off. And that probably was not part of the calculus of like, you know, we’re not, McDonald’s is not required to shut down all their stories, but they just did. Tamara Winter: It’s like interesting, you know, 30 years ago or whatever you see, like those incredible images of the first McDonald’s opening post-Iron Curtain falling. And now, you know, McDonald’s is like pulling out. It’s just, it’s really interesting and visceral. You talk often about cargo as capital. What does that mean when you talk about cargo as capital? Ryan Petersen: Well, just inventories is another form of dollars, the money has taken a different form for a period of time. I mean, that’s trade fundamentally is you’ve exchanged dollars for this other thing, which is a form of capital, working capital, inventory. I think many logistics companies and logistics companies that are buying logistics services, brands, the logistics department is not really thinking in these terms. This is classic, like finance teams think about this. Like they see it on the inventory and on the balance sheet, as you know, working capital, inventory is another line item there. But the logistics teams of the world have been trained, just like buy cheap freight as cheap as they can get the service to buy freight. They’re not really doing the math, which is not that sophisticated, but it takes one degree of sophistication more to realize that, hey, you know what, if you can ship that container 30% faster, then that’s 30% less inventory at any given moment sitting on the water, being unproductive, doing nothing useful. And so you should be willing. Now you can do the math. Are you willing to pay a premium for faster freight in order to get that cash back and reinvest it in your business in more interesting ways and put it to work? This is why, that’s one of the reasons why very high value products will ship by air. You don’t want something really, really valuable sitting on the ocean for a month. One, it might get damaged, but no, it’s more, it’s not valuable have a container load of iPhones. I’ve not done the math. Well, we could probably do the math pretty quickly. There would be probably 50,000 iPhones in a container, times a thousand bucks, each 50 million in an iPhone. I made this up. I have no idea, but I’m just doing it in my head, 50 million dollars. There’s better things Apple can do with 50 million bucks, like run some more ads and pay for air freight, which isn’t that expensive given the value of those products. So those will ship by air. There’s some degree of that, but the typical logistics team doesn’t think that way. And at Flexport, we try to get to, hey, can we help you be heroes, help you represent this data to your CFO so they can see the option like, oh, wow. I could, if I ship, if I pay a little bit more to ship it faster, I get the money back and improve my working capital situation. Tamara Winter: I want to talk about containerization, because I’ve asked you very little about that. You know, shipping containers are kind of, the heart of global trade and of the basic unit for measuring global trade. I want to know, is more generally better when it comes to containerization? Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well I think containers revolutionized trade. We probably reduced the cost of shipping things by like 95 to 99%, depending on the commodity. You see these old photographs, we have some in the Flexport office, like there’s this photographer who worked at the port of Oakland as a longshoreman and was also a photographer. And he took these beautiful pictures right at the dawn of the container era. So they have some containerization, but they also had these guys doing backbreaking work, like hauling sacks on their bag, loading the ships. And the way the ships were loaded was like, literally like tying rope to tie it all down and unbelievably laborious. And it would take a week or more to load a ship, which is not a good use of an asset. Like you’ve got to get this thing moving. It makes money when it sails. So containerization revolutionized the world and made trade possible, made it possible to buy things from around the world and find, you know, allow economic opportunity, jobs to be created and us to have cheap stuff as well. However, there’s been very little progress in that since the seventies when this took place. I don’t think the container itself needs to change form factor. It seems like basically correct. But the process by which they get loaded, unloaded from the ships, seems like there’s a lot of opportunity besides just like, pluck one container at a time off the ship. Like it would be fun to do a design contest where there’s some really creative types. Tamara Winter: Maybe you should. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, conveyor belt, like PEZ dispenser out the front. I don’t know. There’s got to be some better way to do that. Tamara Winter: There’s so much talk right now about the next World’s Fair. Like bringing or World’s Fair, reviving it. I don’t know. I would love to go and see container ships. I was eating at Mission Rock and we were just watching the container ships, just one by one come through and I, it would be really cool to see like a giant robot crane. Ryan Petersen: Well, the thing to watch is, is the crane up or down? Tamara Winter: What does it mean? Ryan Petersen: Well, if it’s up, it’s not working and just watch they’re, they’re not down that often. Tamara Winter: Tell me, speaking of throughput is the health of global trade, is it primarily about throughput? Ryan Petersen: Well from a logistics standpoint, yeah. It’s all about throughput, efficiency costs, you know, transaction costs. How do we lower the transaction costs to reduce the amount of error? Like most actual transaction costs, some of it comes from humans doing work, but I think at least within Flexport, most of the problems come about through bad quality, bad data rework, like having to redo the thing, getting the, when the data’s wrong, it can lead to, you know, a hundred x more cost. Like if you take a customs clearance, if you file with the right data, it might take you a minute to get the data organized correctly, like a minute of human labor and review the documents, we use machine learning to ingest the data off of, if it is a PDF or Excel file or something, but you still need a human to review it and validate it like for compliance reasons. So it might take you a minute. If the data’s wrong, it might take you two weeks of dealing with customs to sort it out and what went wrong. Tamara Winter: I guess I want to know and this might be intuitive to most people, but why is it so important to have uniform standards across countries on things like shipping container dimensions? I didn’t realize that that actually wasn’t standardized until very recently. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well, standards are crucially important for, I mean, the container’s an obvious one because if the container’s a different size, then you can’t have a standard size ship, crane, etcetera. If every container’s different, it just leads to chaos. And so that was actually created by the Federal Maritime Commission, which is a U.S. agency, created that standard. And then used that funding mechanism where if you wanted to build a ship, you basically got super cheap capital. As long as you adhered to the standard. You could build another kind of container ship, but why would you do that when like, this is the standard everyone’s using and it’s like free money if you build a ship like that. So that was one way to get a standard. It’s notoriously how hard to get everyone to agree on standards. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: Well, everyone has their own opinions and you have these very boring consortiums, like I’ve never been involved in the, what do you call the web? The, HTML standard setting body that sets CSS and all these things, I would go crazy. I might have an opinion, but I can’t sit through those meetings, which is dangerous because then the standards get set by like the most boring people possible who are willing to sit through such meetings, and actually it’s a very good example is that the, the 40 foot container was not the right standard necessarily. The companies that invented the shipping container where one was using a 24 foot container and one was using a 26 foot container and for their businesses, that was like more optimal for the size and volume of the stuff that they were shipping. And there’s nothing to say that 40 foot is the right amount. In fact, I would argue it’s definitely the wrong standard because for trucks in the United States, domestic trucks, 53 foot is the length of a standard semi truck, which is really silly because we should have 53 foot ocean containers because then on every single shipment you’d have about 30% more cargo per driver per asset move. Tamara Winter: Why is it 40? Ryan Petersen: It was just set that way. Tamara Winter: It was just arbitrary? Ryan Petersen: By the Federal Maritime Commission. I mean, I don’t know, I wasn’t in, in the meetings standard setting body. Tamara Winter: So maybe it’s your fault because you weren’t in the meetings. Ryan Petersen: Or like take the QWERTY keyboard. I mean, it’s notorious like not, it was set to slow you down rather than type fast. So that’s a bad standard, and yet standards are super valuable. If every keyboard was different, you could only use your own computer. I think optimizations are really important here. So for example, all the containers that we ship on average are only 70% full. Like we use, we digitize these packing lists and do the geometry of the cardboard boxes inside and see that they’re only 70% full, there’s 30% extra space right here. Okay, cool. Like you got 30% savings on carbon just by filling the container correctly. That’s not hard. So there are some easy, low hanging fruit, but fundamentally, how do you replace this? And it might be that this is one of the last holdouts where you continue to use fossil fuels, even as we go to electric fleets on cars or nuclear, hopefully nuclear power for the grid. Like you’re probably not gonna get people comfortable. There has been one nuclear power cargo ship in the history of the world, back in the sixties. I don’t think we’re ever going to go back there. Tamara Winter: What happened to it? Ryan Petersen: It got decommissioned. It went for a couple of years. It was like a super fast boat. But it pre-container era. And so when the containers came along, it was retired and I think it was also pre-Chernobyl when people freaked out about nuclear. Tamara Winter: It is so interesting to me, you know, my background, I went from Bethesda to San Francisco too, then to New York. But it was always really interesting to me to observe the way that technologists interact with government. There’s your sort of Stewart Brand style person who is sort of both very interested in government and very interested in technology, but there is, I think a perception that technologists today sort of hate the government and I wonder why it is so important to you and why you have sort of gone out of your way, really to work with governments basically at this point on every level. Ryan Petersen: Well it’s, our business is in clearing goods through U.S. customs. So we, you know, Flexport couldn’t exist until we got a license from the government to be able to do customs clearance and I had to go through FBI background checks, Department of Homeland Security, every customs broker does. So you know, that is our business is complying with government regulations and we don’t have a problem with the government regulations actually. I think there’s good reasons. Of course I can object to certain things. I think tariffs should be lower or have nuance and stuff like that. But like fundamentally governments have every right to control what goods flow into their country and there’s reasons, very good reasons to prevent drugs and certain kinds of weapons and yeah, illicit activity, counterfeits and stuff from crossing border. So the government plays an appropriate role and we’re happy to work with them constructively on that stuff. As a citizen, I am kind of like confused in San Francisco, why the tech community has been so disengaged with the government. I mean, like we have the board of supervisors is our version of the city council here in San Francisco. And it’s like really antagonistic to technology and to business. They just keep passing rules that are like really anti-business, new taxes, things that are just like, oh, they clearly don’t want us here. We should leave. And yet there’s 11 people on that board. I think probably seven of them are really anti-business and four more moderate and reasonably pro-business appreciate that we employ lots of people in the city and, and pay lots of taxes. So there’s seven seats and, you only need a majority or some form of majority, seven elections, each of which is decided by a couple hundred votes, We are home to some of the greatest technology platforms in the world with literally billions of users. Like we’ve managed to sign up a billion users from your website and you can’t get a hundred people to vote in an election. Like what is going on? Why are we so disengaged? I don’t have a good answer for it, I think you’ll probably start to see people wake up take action and like, look it’s, I believe deeply in democracy, but part of the democratic process is people like taking action and getting people getting out to vote. Tamara Winter: And, you know, as you look across whether it’s shipping, Flexport, what are you optimistic about? Ryan Petersen: Well, you know, it’s, you have to stay optimistic about the ability for individuals to make a difference. I found over and over again in life that if you just take some action, it has a quality of its own that, can pick up the phone and call someone and make something happen, send emails, make stuff happen, and the world just kind of responds. Most recently, like we had this concept on our executive team meetings. Tuesday after the war started, we’re like, hey, we should activate flexport.org on Ukrainian relief. Tamara Winter: For people who don’t know what is flexport.org? Ryan Petersen: Oh, that’s the impact arm of Flexport. We do logistics for humanitarian relief, disaster relief. It has two missions, one is carbon measurement and offsetting and mitigation and two is humanitarian relief. So this is our impact arm. Of course the executive team level we thought of, hey, let’s get flexport.org working on this. flexport.org had already been working on it for like three days. They had already lined up nonprofits and aid agencies and would take action. But we, what we said was, hey, let’s help them raise some money. I mean, there’s only so much that Flexport can do as one company to pay for very expensive humanitarian relief operations. So let’s reach out, texted a couple of people. Next thing I know Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis run this like GoFundMe campaign that’s as of this moment has raised 20 million bucks for us and for airbnb.org to house refugees, us to do logistics for refugee sites. It’s like four days, we did that. And not everyone has our brand and our resources and knows how to text Ashton Kutcher or whatever, but like, you can start on a smaller level and just take some action and help somebody. And especially when you try to help someone else is when the world tries to help you, help you help them. But next thing you know, it’s a virtuous cycle and we’ve seen that with flexport.org. In fact, that was part of the reason that we set it up in a way that we can take donations is it allows us to go out and ask people to get involved, like our customers. We get them to donate products. If we can find a product that our customers make that a refugee camp needs, that’s like, what we do is we match them and we pay for the logistics, or we’ll get a donor to pay for the logistics. But like, by getting that sense of community engagement, everybody’s asked to help. People love to help. Like they want give back, they want to find these opportunities. And so I’m so very optimistic of the power of kind of, I might call it naive optimism that like, believing that you can do something, even if it’s tiny and it has a power of its own to inspire other people to do that. We live in a messed up world, but I don’t think it’s more messed up than it’s been in the past. Like there’s always been wars, since the dawn of humanity, go read the books, like there’s been much worse wars as bad as it is to say, because we’ve never had an iPhone to watch this stuff firsthand the way we do right now. But wars have gone on since the dawn of men and that is not going to change because human nature is not going to change. There’s gonna be wars in the future. And yet humans also, I think if you were to go over right now to Poland, you would see people taking care of each other people housing refugees, people looking after families. And so the bright spot of humanity is not going to change either. And there’s a lot to be optimistic about for sure. It’s like kind of crazy to recognize we all do kind of have these superpowers. It takes a long time to compound so that the world’s given me more resources and connectivity and network to get stuff done, but I think we all have that superpower a bit. And the more you use it, the more it compounds, and becomes more powerful. Like I have a couple of friends who are I might call them like obsessive phone users on like the old school, like call people. And these people have superpowers that would, you would not believe. Like the willingness, I don’t have this, but if you had it, the willingness to make 20 to a hundred phone calls per day, if you make a hundred phone calls per day in 10 years, you’ll be a billionaire. I’m certain of it. One of them called me last night. We’re flying all these goods over to Ukraine and he’s trying to get me to fill the planes full of refugees coming back. And I’m like, that’s a great idea. They’re passenger planes. So there’s empty seats. We could do that, but they need visas to come into the United States. He’s like, yeah, you’re right. Okay. And he like patches me through and calls this like world famous venture capitalist while I’m on the line, gets him on the phone, is like, “Hey, can you help us get visas for refugees coming to the country?” He’s like, “I don’t know why you would think that I could help you with that. But like, let me see, I’ll email the government,” and like next thing, you know, like emailing senators and like I have no idea if that’ll happen or not, probably not, but like I’ve seen crazier plans work and it’s just like the willingness, energy to go try stuff, like make it work. And then you keep trying it and it compounds so, a bit like that. With my kind of port tour tweet or, you know, I’ve just been trying stuff like this for a long time and finding out like, oh wow. It can, like, you can actually have a big impact out there if you, if you’re willing to look stupid sometimes and just go for it. Tamara Winter: So that was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport. I don’t think there’s a lot more to say after that other than maybe we should all be making a few more phone calls? In the meantime, I hope you will join us for the next episode of Beneath the Surface. We’ll be looking at a type of infrastructure that has acutely felt the impacts of COVID-era supply chain disruptions: housing. We’ll travel to London and visit with a Haredi Jewish community that has fought to upzone their houses so they can have room for their large families. Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager extraordinaire. Our associate producer and editor for this episode was Astrid Landon. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, films, and more visit press.stripe.com. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Ben Southwood: It’s March the 15th. Half past one in the afternoon and I’m standing on a residential street in South Tottenham, which is in Haringey, a borough of North London. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood. He’s out on the streets of London to look at houses. Ben Southwood: So the buildings we have here are two-story terraced Victorian and Edwardian homes. I can see many of them have cornices under their eaves or bay windows, gables… Tamara Winter: And he’s looking at these houses here because many of them are beginning to change. Ben Southwood: This residential street’s not quite like every residential street in the country because in addition to its normal two-story Victorian terraced homes, there are additional extensions that have been put on many of these houses. They have been built directly upwards, completely in keeping with the existing Victorian facade. In fact, I’m standing directly opposite an extension going on right now. Tamara Winter: Victorian houses in the UK were built during the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901. People from across the country flocked to London just as the industrial revolution was picking up speed. From 1811 to 1851, the population of Greater London doubled, half of the country’s population called the city home. A lot of new housing was needed and fast. And today, many of these Victorian houses are still in use. But now, London faces a new housing crisis: unaffordable rents, overcrowded conditions, and the dream of home ownership drifting further away from the city’s young people. London isn’t alone here. A similar story is happening around the world in cities large and small. However, on that quiet residential street in South Tottenham, the story behind those extensions offers a lesson for those tackling the global housing crisis. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our previous episode, we looked at supply chains: the movement of materials and products from country to country and a delicate dance that makes up the global economy. Today, we’re looking at a component of infrastructure that by its very nature doesn’t move: housing. The issues around housing are diverse and wide ranging. Whether the locality in question is a small town or global metropolis, every place has its own unique challenges. Still, once you dig a little deeper, you start to see some common threads. In this episode, we’ll explore why housing prices have risen dramatically in so many places and how individual neighborhoods, like South Tottenham in London, can address these challenges. For most of human history, people lived in rural areas. But over the last two centuries, cities around the world have seen explosive growth. The UN estimates that 2007 was the first year that most people lived in urban areas and the urban population is expected to double by 2050. This means that cities are having to adapt in unprecedented ways. How do we deliver food and other goods? How do we move through and between cities? And where are all of these new urban dwellers going to live? Because right now, the increase in population is leading to a housing shortage. The supply of homes in most cities has not kept up with the demand, unless supply means prices naturally go up. Archived audio: Housing prices are continuing to surge across… Archived audio: We’ve seen house prices go up steadily by several thousand… Archived audio: Housing prices in Ireland rising by a hundred euro a day. Archived audio: Housing costs taking a bigger bite out of your paycheck and it doesn’t seem to be any relief in sight. Emily Hamilton: I would say that affordability in US cities is the biggest challenge right now. Tamara Winter: This is Emily Hamilton. She was at the top of my list of people I wanted to talk to for this episode on housing. Emily Hamilton: I’m a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Tamara Winter: She says the most relevant housing challenge across the country and really across the world is affordability. Emily Hamilton: Several decades ago, urban policy makers were much more concerned about having too many residents leaving cities and issues like vacancy and crime were much more relevant than affordability. But today, as cities have become job centers once again and are generally the location where the highest paying jobs in the US are located, it’s become much more of a question of how to make space for everyone who would like to live in cities and be able to access those job markets at prices that are affordable to them. And in many parts of the world, that holds true as well, particularly English speaking parts of the world, like the UK and Canada, are facing very similar affordability challenges to the US. Tamara Winter: I’ll admit that I’m a statistic on this trend as well. Since graduating from college in 2017, I’ve lived in some of the most expensive cities in the US: Washington DC, San Francisco, and now, New York. From 1980 to 2020, housing prices in the New York metropolitan area have gone up 700%, more than double wage growth during that same period. In other words, an apartment that sold for $200,000 in 1980 would’ve sold for $1.4 million in 2020. In San Francisco, house prices went up over 900%, and cities outside the US have seen equally dramatic numbers. Ireland saw prices rise by about 800% driven primarily by Dublin. Prices in Sydney, Australia were up almost 1,500%. And in London, the average home price in 1980 was about 25,000 pounds. In 2020, the average price was about 490,000 pounds, a nearly 2,000% increase. Ben Southwood: Well, the UK, and the UK isn’t alone here, has a shortage of housing around its most successful, big cities. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood, again. He’s currently an editor for the online magazine, Works in Progress, but he’s been studying housing for a long time. Ben Southwood: I worked in housing policy for much of the last five years, including at Create Streets, Policy Exchange, and the Adam Smith Institute. I’m obsessed with housing. In the morning, I wake up thinking, "How are we going to solve the housing problems in the UK today?" And I go to bed in the evening, also, still thinking about how are we going to solve the problems in the UK has with housing. And this shortage of housing has led to massive increases in the price of that housing either to buy or to rent and also big shortages and long waiting lists for government-provided housing. Tamara Winter: Ben is always thinking about unique solutions to the housing crisis. So when he came across a series of interesting building renovations happening in North London, he had to investigate. Ben Southwood: Most of the time in England, when you do upwards extensions on homes, those extensions look very different to the house underneath and often are very ugly. And often, therefore, neighbors oppose them very vociferously. However, this extension, interestingly, was identical to the building underneath. In fact, it looked as if they had cut off the roof, added an identical story, and then plopped the roof back on top again. Tamara Winter: So Ben did what any good researcher would do these days: he took the question to Twitter. Ben Southwood: A councilor from North London, that is someone who had been elected by the local residents to be on the council—council is just the standard form of local government in the UK—replied to our Twitter threads, telling us what happened. Tamara Winter: The councilor revealed that the people of this community had a particular need for these housing extensions because they were Haredi Jews. Archived audio: Two hundred boys and girls waved a greeting to England, land of the free, the advanced guard of the first 5,000 Jewish and non-Aryan child refugees from Germany will be provided with a temporary home here while arrangements are made for them to immigrate. Tamara Winter: Haredi Jews first established themselves in London in the 1920s. However, it was after the second World War that the area really started to take off as Jewish refugees fled the Holocaust. Haredi Jews tend to be stricter in their practice of Orthodox Judaism than their peers. They adhere to kosher diets, go to synagogue several times a day, and send their children to religious schools. They also observe Shabbat on Saturdays, meaning, they don’t drive or use electricity. All of these cultural factors mean that Haredi Jewish people tend to live in tight knit and compact communities. One area they settled in was Stamford Hill. It’s in a borough of Hackney in North London. Today, it is the largest strictly Orthodox Jewish community in all of Europe. Add to that, the large size of Haredi families and the result has been overcrowded housing conditions. So yet another neighborhood in North London sprung up as a hub for the Haredi community, South Tottenham in the borough of Haringey. By one estimate, the number of Haredi families has increased fivefold in the last several decades. That’s where Ben found himself, investigating housing extensions. Ben Southwood: Hi there. I’m standing in South Tottenham, which is a neighborhood in North London looking around a suburban street. I have two-story Victorian homes. It’s quite quiet. I can see a few people walking down every few minutes. I can see lots of people walking around in Orthodox Jewish clothing. And I’m just about to meet my friend, Mark, at his house. Tamara Winter: I talked with Ben after his trip to hear more about what he learned. Ben Southwood: The local community is Haredi Jewish. Most of them are also Hasidic, which means they have particular ways of dressing, and particular religious rights, and so on. And I met with three leaders in the Haredi community in North London: Mark Groskopf, Shmuel Davidson, and Motty Pinter. Mark Groskopf: My name is Mark Groskopf and I’m from the Jewish Tottenham community. Ben Southwood: Mark is a family man with nine children, one of whom has left the house. Shmuel Davidson: I’m Shmuel Davidson. I’m from the Tottenham Jewish association. I’m also a deputy on the board of deputies and being a community activist here in the area, where I’ve lived all my life. And I thrive to build this area. Ben Southwood: Shmuel is a man who’s very much in demand. During our interview, he had to leave to take phone calls about five times constantly responding to community’s desires and needs. Motty Pinter: My name is Motty Pinter. I work for Chinuch UK, which is the representative body for 80 Haredi schools across the country. I also work for Agudas Israel Housing Association. Ben Southwood: Motty is the extremely energetic leader of the Hackney community. Motty Pinter: We liaise with the council and we do a lot of work with the council. So any issues, they’ll come in to try to understand the Jewish community and see what the needs are. Ben Southwood: This community has lots of kids on average. One of the stats said their average number of children was six. Motty Pinter: In Hackney, 8.1% of the population is Haredi. But when you look at the children population, you have 25.9% of the children population in Hackney is Haredi. When you drill that down to two to five-year-olds, you have over 30% of children, which are Haredi now. So what you figure is how many households. Ben Southwood: So all of these families having six children, the houses just weren’t built for them. Most communities, if they get overcrowded, decide to move out to the suburbs where land is cheaper, rather than staying in central London where land is more expensive. However, the Haredi Jewish community were not willing to do this because all of their cultural amenities are in one place. Shmuel Davidson: I can’t just move randomly to another borough where I don’t have a synagogue, I don’t have a kosher shop, I don’t have schools. My daily life is going synagogue. It’s just part of my daily routine. We pray three times a day. Going to the synagogue is just what we do. We can’t just move random everywhere. We don’t have a synagogue. It’s not, we just don’t have a life. My whole life, my whole family life will just be completely not there. Take for example, weekend Shabbat, I don’t use public transport. We have to walk. So I need a synagogue within walking distance. I need kosher food. I can’t just go to the local grocery store and find food there. There’s no kosher food there. I need to be able to go shopping on a daily basis. I need a bakery. I need a kosher bakery. I need a butcher. I need a kosher butcher. I need a school for my children. My children could go to non-Jewish school, however, culturally inappropriate. Yes, they will be educated nationally, the proper way, as education goes, however, the cultural appropriate education, the religious education, they will not get and they won’t feel comfortable there. I won’t feel comfortable. Shmuel Davidson: This is part of my daily life, my daily infrastructure. So we need to be living in an area where we have the community infrastructure, the synagogues, the shops, the schools, everything we need as a community and live our lives. Ben Southwood: So all of these things make it very difficult for the Haredi community to spread out. They need to be near one another and they have a very vibrant cultural life as well, which is another reason why they would like to be near, with one another as well. All of these things meant they weren’t willing to move out. So instead of moving out, the Haredi Jewish community decided, "Well, should we buy more of the houses in the neighborhood and spread out in each direction?" Well, firstly, it’s very expensive. It might cost them 500,000 pounds to buy the next door neighbor’s house. Secondly, that takes houses off the market and that means other people can’t live there. And finally, there just aren’t enough houses to go round. Tamara Winter: The housing challenges the Haredi community face are just one example. Any neighborhood can grow beyond its limits because of high birth rates, increased immigration, or simply because it’s a newly desirable place to live, but the Haredi community represents this perfect storm of housing crisis. They have on average eight people in their families. They need to be within walking distance of certain shops and community services, making it really hard to relocate. And the area where they live is way too expensive to buy any neighboring homes. If they can work their way through a housing crisis, shouldn’t it be doable anywhere? Stuck in the situation where they needed more space, some Haredi families decided to just start modifying their homes. But because of housing regulations in the UK, that’s easier said than done. Ben explains. Ben Southwood: So in the UK, we have something called planning, which is what Americans call zoning. But the difference between planning and zoning is that zoning is usually rules-based, so there are a bunch of rules that say what you can build and where, and then developers have to follow those rules. Planning in the UK is discretion-based, so every individual house, if you want to extend that house by adding a story or putting a different window on it or something like that, you have to apply to the local government and say, "Please, can I do this?" There are almost no developments that you can do without a specific permit with the council, which is the local government, going through the details of that permit, and councils look through every application bit by bit. And so it makes it very uncertain, very costly to pursue development because it’s uncertain whether you’re going to get permission or not. Some of them were building up in the maximum way they were allowed under the current rules or even pushing the rules to the limit. Building ugly box dormers is what they call them: boxes. And neighbors were objecting to these because they were unsightly and they were ruining the original heritage of the Victorian buildings, but they needed the space. So there was this conundrum where they wanted space, but the existing ways of delivering space were insufficient and ugly. Tamara Winter: Here’s Shmuel Davidson. Shmuel Davidson: There was no basic guidelines on what the rights, what the wrongs were. People were trying all sorts of things and it was just causing all sorts of problems for planning, enforcement, and it was just getting nowhere. And it got to the point where the community and the local authority really became heads up together and the whole thing. Ben Southwood: So they petitioned the council and said, "Look, can we build upwards?" Tamara Winter: Mark Groskopf again. Mark Groskopf: And Shmuel and I was going backwards and forwards saying, "Look, let’s come up with a solution." And it was actually after sitting, going backwards and forward, they turned their around and said, "Look, you know what? These actual lofts are ugly. Let’s come up with a new plan." We want a space, they wanted looks. Ben Southwood: Working with the council, the community came up with the idea of extending the buildings upwards in a way that was consistent with their existing style so that the street looked like it had just been originally built as a Victorian three-story street. Basically, you take off the roof, you add in an extra story that looks just like the one underneath and then you put the roof back on. So it just looks like the original building, but stretched upwards. It can get four or five in some cases, six bedrooms added on top. Tamara Winter: And over the years, the community began to make some progress working with the local council. Here’s Motty Pinter. Motty Pinter: They would put forward the most recent update, people would be able to argue over it or say their opinions. They would put things down on the table and say, "These are ideas that the architects have raised." And then people around the room would be able to say, "Yeah, but this won’t work here or it will work here." Tamara Winter: The council in Haringey was surprisingly open to the Haredi community’s ideas, but there was still some opposition. Motty Pinter: We heard different views from different people. Some of those have been extremely challenging. For some people, they see this as something new and they’re concerned how it’s going to look and how it’s going to end up. Shmuel Davidson: In this area, we had actually people, residents who worked silently against it. However, once we came about the design, with the concept, with the idea, working endlessly with the local authority, with both the politicians and the officers, together with community. And with the product we were going to deliver, I think all around, the opponents, very nice, but they saw the benefits just outweighed the opponents a million times. Ben Southwood: It still took years and years of work from the community to get the design code put through and make it so that if they made a planning application to the council, the council was very likely to say, "Yes, as long as it stayed within the rules they had set out in advance." Motty Pinter: I think once this is actually introduced and it’s introduced more widely, I think a lot of those fears won’t be there anymore. I think it’s just people being concerned about what is going to happen, but when it actually happens, they’re going to see a lot of benefit. Shmuel Davidson: When I grew up here, the concept of building extensions, those days was virtually nonexistent. And I see families today who have built like what we’re standing in front of now, which… Ben Southwood: There’s one going on right now as we speak. Shmuel Davidson: Right. I was going to say that it’s going up right now, which has just made a complete life changer, a life changer to the area, a life changer to the families. The design, it just fits into a beautifully Victorian side of the houses. It doesn’t look odd. It doesn’t stand out. The quality gives to the family, to the people. And if you just go around the area, just see the development, which has gone on here, which has been achieved by this magnificent idea, which I think we’re unique for the country, I think. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Shmuel Davidson: And it’s absolutely amazing. I just hope others will just copy us and do that because as there’s a housing crisis generally across everywhere, and we know there’s just no housing. Our achievement was the product which we have, which we see today. And this is a phenomenal product and it’s a product of community coalition, a product of working with the local politicians, a product working with the local offices, a product working with local residents, consultations, perseverance, nonstop, and knowing where your end goal is going to be and really go for it. Never drop out, never give up. Because eventually, if that’s what you want to get achieved, I want to get there, you’ll get there. Tamara Winter: What Mark, Shmuel, Motty and the rest of the Haredi community were able to make happen in South Tottenham is ultimately a success story. And the numbers would suggest that this success should be replicable. Haredi families have, on average, around six children. The birth rate in England and Wales in 2020 was 1.58 children per woman, a much smaller number. So if the Haredi community can create abundant housing with such a high population growth rate, certainly, it could be done across the larger UK population. But remember that it didn’t just magically happen, it took perseverance and patience, and working within the system to make progress. But why can’t the system be more accommodating to encourage more housing in the first place? Why does it take so much effort to build housing, something that London desperately needs? John Myers: What we see if we look at traditional zoning in places like England is that they were never designed to streamline that sort of process. They were never designed to solve those political challenges. I mean, zoning was essentially designed to stop change in many places. Tamara Winter: This is John Myers. He’s working at the forefront of pushing for housing reform in the UK. John Myers: We shouldn’t be surprised that we’re not getting plentiful housing in areas with zoning, because it was never designed to allow the densification that we used to see historically over centuries in cities, and which led to much loved urbanism that you see in historic housing cities in Europe today. Tamara Winter: His work goes back to 2014. John read an article that made him realize just how upside down the housing market truly was. John Myers: It explained that the total market price of housing in the UK was three times more than what it would cost to rebuild all of that housing at today’s prices from scratch. And so that to me was the biggest distortion I’ve ever seen in any market or industry anywhere. It’s just an eye watering shortage. And it tells you that there’s something really wrong there. It means that the reason why housing is so expensive in London is not because there’s some shortage of land or because we have a brick shortage, it’s because you’re simply not allowed to build more even when it would be enormously economically beneficial to do so. And that was just the most broken thing I’ve ever seen. Tamara Winter: John’s organization is called YIMBY Alliance, which stands for: Yes, in My Backyard. It’s a counter to NIMBY or Not in My Backyard. The NIMBY acronym was born from neighborhoods that didn’t want the downsides of new housing near them. Understandably, there are plenty of reasons to not want certain projects in your neighborhood. After all, who wants to live next to a coal power plant or a garbage dump? But when it comes to building housing, the effects are generally felt very locally: things like construction noise and additional traffic. And so the idea behind John’s YIMBY movement is that the collective economic and social benefits of allowing new developments will outweigh any short-term side effects. And John’s proposal is to leave the decision to build denser housing to the people who live on the street, where the housing will actually be built. It’s a proposal he calls ‘street votes.’ John Myers: If somebody turns a single family home on your street into say townhouses or into low rise, apartment blocks, that mainly only affects the other people on your street, especially if effects on parking and other traffic congestion are controlled carefully. So there’s no real reason why, if the broad majority, the overwhelming majority of people on your street, are happy for those sorts of developments to happen to gracefully allow single family homes to be turned into townhouses or even something a bit more ambitious. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be able to choose to allow that so long as the neighbors on other streets are protected. Tamara Winter: Street votes certainly sounds like a winning scenario for neighborhoods with each individual voter deciding for themselves if they’d like to capture the benefits of new developments. But of course, it’s not always easy for entire neighborhoods to come together. In South Tottenham, for example, the neighbors were opposed to changing the aesthetic of the old homes there. They ultimately found a solution, but surely, looks can’t be the only thing holding back new housing. Is there more behind this resistance to change? Tamara Winter: Thank you. I think we’re good. Yeah? Ronan Lyons: Yep. And my phone has just gone... yeah, no, it’s still working away there. Tamara Winter: Hello! Yes, I’m so excited about this. I got in touch with Ronan Lyons. Ronan Lyons: My name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin. Tamara Winter: Ronan is a bit of a housing guru in Ireland. Ronan Lyons: People in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the daft reports. Daft is like Zillow or the Right Move in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal. Once a quarter or twice a quarter, one for rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: In Ireland, we see the same story playing out as in so many other countries. Ronan Lyons: In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many... especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. Tamara Winter: It turns out, the history of these rules are part of the reason it’s so hard to change housing policy. Ronan Lyons: What had happened between the ’40s and the ’70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate. What it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country, now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. That was kind of a key turning point. Because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever, and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet. Tamara Winter: And so when politicians are trying to appeal to voters, anything that will affect the value of their homes can get politically dicey. Ronan Lyons: When they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get the elected to do so. People who come along, they won’t phrase it like this, "I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes." That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way, you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "And I’m going to price that new households." That’s a vote winner. If you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who are there already and secured their housing, have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: Despite this individual opposition, the benefits of growth and new housing are widespread throughout society. There’s better investment in infrastructure, attracting new businesses, creating more jobs. And of course, keeping house prices affordable. And with John Myers’ street votes plan, he believes that there will be enough people who see through the short-term to the larger upside. And he’s hopeful because he’s seen this localized effort work outside the UK. First, in Israel. John Myers: The most recent example that comes to mind is in Tel Aviv where the government proposed the means for residents to be allowed to decide if they wanted to redevelop their own apartment block, either extend it or to replace it with an entire new block with more apartments in it. That accounted for about 35% of the new homes in Tel Aviv in 2020. It’s an astonishing increase. Tamara Winter: Second, in South Korea in the 1990s. John Myers: The government allowed areas of single story homes to vote collectively if they wanted to give themselves permission to redevelop that whole area. And again, that accounted for the majority, I think, of the new condos built in Seoul for a portion of the 1990s. Tamara Winter: Lastly, a city in my home state: Houston, Texas John Myers: Houston, as you know, doesn’t have zoning in the traditional sense of the term, but it does have what are called minimum lot size requirements. And that says that if you want to build a new home, you have to have a piece of land which is at least a certain size. Those sizes were quite big. And the city of Houston wanted to reduce that size to allow more homes to be built in Houston, to keep Houston affordable for renters. There was a fair amount of political resistance from people living in areas of single family homes with large lot areas. And so in order to overcome that pushback, they decided to allow effectively an opt-out from the change that they were proposing and that let them get that change through, and you see the results in Houston where there’s a lot of new housing being constructed as a result of that. There are a lot of homeowners who are probably better off because their plot can now be used for more housing than it was before. And yet, the people who are most resistant to change have been able to opt out. And so this principle of giving flexibility on a very small level can make it much more politically palatable to engineer change and to get more housing. If you offer families a way to literally change their lives, the way to guarantee housing for their children or their grandchildren, a way to make it much easier to live, and all they have to do is vote for graceful change, which is completely consistent with what we’ve seen in cities over centuries, I have to believe that a small amount of people will do that. And that’s very consistent with what we’ve seen in Tel Aviv. It’s consistent with what happened in Seoul. And it’s also consistent with the fact that most of Houston didn’t opt out of these changes. Tamara Winter: And as John points out, the needle doesn’t have to move that much to see real change. John Myers: We don’t actually need to upzone the entire London or the entire of the Bay Area in order to get vastly amounts, more housing. So in London, if you just took 3, 4, 5% of the lowest density areas, you would engineer a step change. You would more than double the supply of housing in London. Tamara Winter: With all of these examples, John feels optimistic that street votes can gain some real political momentum in the UK. John Myers: We’ve seen quite a fair amount of traction in England with that. We’ve been lucky enough to find an incredible coalition that has supported these sorts of ideas, because it’s ultimately not very controversial. There aren’t really that many people who disagree with the proposition. But if the people on the street want to see more development, they should be allowed to permit it. Motty Pinter: I want to put it on pause for a second? Ben Southwood: That’s okay. But it’s fine to get extra… Motty Pinter: I have a tendency to talk too much. You don’t stop me, then.. Tamara Winter: Finally, back in South Tottenham, Ben wrapped up his interview with Mark, Shmuel, and Motty. By one estimate, the Haredi community has added a thousand extra bedrooms using their method of building extensions. Ben Southwood: Okay. So let’s have a little look around. Tamara Winter: And Mark himself had recently constructed a loft conversion onto his own Victorian house. Mark Groskopf: It was built about six months ago. So I was living in a bedroom, seven kids living in one bedroom, three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. Ben Southwood: Wow. Mark Groskopf: That’s how the family was living. Tamara Winter: So before Ben left, Mark gave him a tour of the house. Mark Groskopf: You’ve come into the hallway, you’ve got a dining room. So it’s quite a big dining room which we’ll extend it slightly. And then… Ben Southwood: Mark has a very large dining room, presumably to fit his nine children, wife, and self in having dinner at the same time. Mark Groskopf: Let’s go upstairs. Ben Southwood: And we go upstairs and Mark shows me what the house originally looked like. There were two bedrooms and two bathrooms. In one of the bedrooms was the master bedroom and the other bedroom was seven of his children. Mark Groskopf: This is where we had three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. We got two bunk beds. Ben Southwood: Now, there’s only two children in that original seven-children bedroom. And the other children are all spread across different bedrooms. Mark Groskopf: And we got another floor. Ben Southwood: And he’s added four bedrooms on the top floor. Mark Groskopf: And then you’ve got a front room over here, as you can see how big it is. Ben Southwood: Wow. Imagine. So you were going from that room where there were six of them in there. Mark Groskopf: Yeah. Ben Southwood: And then now, they’ve got a huge two-bedroom. Mark Groskopf: That’s correct. Ben Southwood: He says that this has made a huge difference to his children’s experience of school, to the togetherness, everyone’s getting along better. It really is striking how one-and-a-half extra stories can make such a large difference to how much space there is to go around when there’s seven children’s crammed into one bedroom, it must be much harder to have lots of the things that you want as a child. Mark Groskopf: And then we go up to the next floor. And what I’ve done is in this area over here, where the front of the house goes alone, we call it the apex. We’ve left over there and it’s a center room. We use it as a center room. Ben Southwood: Ah. Mark Groskopf: So you’ve got the toys down over there. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Mark Groskopf: And then the kids go inside over there and relax and enjoy themselves over there. Ben Southwood: Mark’s family looks after kids with special needs from the community. Mark Groskopf: Every weekend, we bring kids in from the other families to give the parents a rest… Ben Southwood: In the low ceiling part, he put in a sensory room with interesting lights and sounds and so on for kids to go in. And apparently, they really like it. Wow. Well, my mother would love to meet you then because she does a lot of work. It’s amazing how much they’ve managed to add how many... they’ve got extra bedrooms. They make all the space, they’ve got extra bathrooms, and this is all just on the existing plot.

Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to last week’s episode of this podcast, you heard excerpts from my interview with Dr. Ronan Lyons. He’s an associate professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and the director of Trinity Research and Social Sciences, an interdisciplinary research initiative that brings together scholars from across the university. In our conversation, he offers insights into the complexities of housing broadly and explains why the challenges plaguing housing markets are especially acute in Ireland. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dr. Ronan Lyons. Tamara Winter: Hello. Yes, I’m so excited about this. Okay. So the first thing I’m just going to have you do is introduce yourself and your academic affiliations, if you will. Ronan Lyons: Sure. So my name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in economics at Trinity College Dublin, where I’m also the director of a center called Trinity Research and Social Sciences which is like a collection of a few hundred research active social scientists across all disciplines in the social sciences here in Trinity and people in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the Daft Reports. Daft.ie is like the Zillow or the Rightmove in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal and once a quarter or twice a quarter, once for a rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: So Ronan, well, that’s actually really helpful. I’m curious about your journey into housing. How did that become a topic of interest for you? And I’m also curious, if I may, about your personal housing situation, because you have...it’s three children, is that right? Ronan Lyons: That’s right. Three boys, six and under, so a busy household. So I actually studied as an undergrad at Trinity and I did economics and political science. And afterwards, as many people find themselves, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do and I was in the lucky position that I was offered a scholarship to stay at Trinity. And I did some research in economic history, the history of trade and globalization, which I found really interesting, but then you’re like, "Well, I’ve picked one thing and I fall into one thing, what else do I want to do?" So I worked in policy making for a while. I worked for the National Competitiveness Council in Ireland. So Ireland as a small open economy is really dependent on its ability to trade internationally. So the Competitiveness Council advises the prime minister and the cabinet on where Ireland is doing well or badly. So that gave me a, I suppose, a taste of policy analysis, policy advice, and policy making and how policy happens. And at the same time, a friend of mine had set up daft.ie, the Irish property portal when he was in high school. And after I finished my degree, he came to me and he said, "Could we do a report where we look at the...just the rental sector in Ireland and how it’s performing?" Because there weren’t...it wasn’t the same, I suppose, measurement of housing market conditions at the time. So I accidentally ended up in housing but after working in...I was doing this as a side gig and I was working for the Competitiveness Council and I did a bit of work for IBM as part of their policy consulting. And I was moving around. So I had done research, I’d done policy making, I did private sector, but I realized that actually the thing I really enjoyed was research. So I had gone wandering around, but I came full circle. And in some ways you have to do that, right? You have to go and, or somebody like me has to do that. I need to know what I’m not doing to know that I’ve made the right choice, but in 2009, then I started at Oxford, a doctorate there looking at the Irish housing bubble and crash. And I finished 2013 and I was lucky enough that Trinity was hiring at the time. So I started in the department of economics then and I’ve kept those economic history or long run economic development as one hat and housing is another hat. And I see them as related because when you look at housing and you look at real estate, if you think about the immobility of a home or a building, when you buy it, you’re buying the opportunity associated with the location. And unlike a worker can move and financial capital can move and some workers are more or less mobile, that’s certainly true, but a dwelling isn’t. So the idea of using housing and using land to tell us something about what is good or bad about a location or what people are more or less confident about for me, that’s the heart of why real estate and why housing is really interesting in addition to the very obvious thing that we all need somewhere to live, right? And if...as we’ll presumably get onto, if we don’t have enough places to live, then all sorts of problems arise from that. Tamara Winter: That’s actually exactly the next question. It’s so funny as we’ve done some of these interviews, one of the producers are working with was like, "Tammy, I think you take for granted the idea that people just know what’s going on with housing, what the problem even is, if there is one." So I might actually ask you that question as, and maybe you can both couch it in Ireland, this is very much an issue across the world. What is the basic challenge with housing right now? Whether it’s affordability, not having enough homes, et cetera. Can you explain it to me like I’m five? Ronan Lyons: I’ll do my best. And I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many, especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. And some of that is population growth. And Ireland is I think, unusual in Europe in that it will have faster population growth this century than last century. And some of that’s the long shadow of, there was a famine in the 1840s and that’s why there’s such a large Irish-American community and there’s also a large Irish community in Britain as well. And that has those deep historical roots, but since the 1980s and 1990s, Ireland has had a successful business model where it’s a gateway to the single European market. And as a result of that, it has had all sorts of growing pains. As in incomes have gone up, population has gone up, Ireland has gone from net emigration to net immigration and all of those are signs of success, but unless you scale up the infrastructure as well, then you will come up with all sorts of congestion challenges. And the timing was fortuitous for things like road infrastructure, the European Union gave Ireland money to help build a motorway network. It didn’t have any highways 30 years ago, but in relation to housing, that’s a much more local issue and like many places, we have for various reasons, many of which are worthy, made it more difficult to build a home. So in addition to the population angle, we also have something that’s common in other countries as well but I think Ireland is particularly acute in this, changing demographics. So if you think of countries on a journey from having households of four or five persons on average to households having one or two persons on average, and some cases, maybe three, but you see, average household size is going from four to two, even with the same population, you need twice as many homes, but the homes are different. And on top of that, if you go from rural to urban in the same a hundred year transition, you are going from larger rural homes to smaller urban homes. And that’s a challenge of location and it’s a challenge of mix, but it’s also a challenge of viability because not everything scales down, you need plumbing, you need a bathroom and a shower and a toilet and a kitchen, regardless of how many people you have in the home. You need some basic infrastructure in there. So providing a home for one person is not a quarter of the cost of providing one home for four people. And I think that’s a big challenge that Ireland has struggled with and I think other countries struggled with as well, it’s perhaps less obvious than the population increase bit but certainly in Ireland’s case, providing urban housing for smaller households is not something the country is good at and it’s even a struggle to get politicians and policy makers to recognize the scale of that need. Tamara Winter: Could you explain basically what happens when the housing stock doesn’t match population growth or immigration? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So actually part of my doctorate, one of the main chapters was trying to come up with what you might think of as a house price equation. What happens, house prices or housing prices if income goes up, if supply goes up, if credit conditions get tighter or looser, and the credit conditions bit was super important at the time, because Ireland was coming out of a bubble and crash situation. So that was the focus at the time was how much, if nothing else changes and you loosen credit conditions, what happens property prices and sure enough, they go up and tightening them brings them back down again. And a lot of macro credential rules are about trying to level that out, take that channel for amplifying house prices up and down and just really calm it down. So that then leaves you once you at least try and contain those credit conditions, then it leaves you with this battle between supply and fundamental demand rather than credit demand or assets, factors like that. And on the fundamental demand side, you’ve got income per household and you’ve got household size. And those two things in Ireland’s case have been in...household size been going down, right? So you need more households per population or more dwellings per population and incomes have been going up. And this is another tricky bit for policy makers, the richer you get, the more you consume of everything, some things you shift into and some things you shift out of, but you consume on balance more of everything, the richer you get and that includes housing. And going back to that piece of research I did for my thesis, one of the things we were trying to do was take out that bit and say, "Okay, if you hold income constant then you increase supply by 10%, what happens?" And our best estimate was that if you did that exercise, you would lower prices by about 12%. And that’s a fundamental that, again, in many countries, people are questioning, right? Because they see completions going up, more new homes getting built and they see prices of rents going up and they go, "You can’t say to me that if you build more homes, prices will go down because that’s not happening at the moment." And really this gets to the heart of the social science of housing is that that correlation is not about causation, that what’s actually happening here is that homes are getting built because there’s a lot of need. And in Ireland’s case, there’s a need for maybe 40 to 50,000 homes a year and it’s only building 20,000. Now, if you didn’t build those 20,000, rents and sale prices would increase even more. And that’s the tricky bit because it’s very hard to argue with someone who doesn’t, who sees the correlation and doesn’t believe the underlying theory. It’s hard to say to them, "Well, let’s stop building and let’s see how that goes," right? That’s not a viable suggestion because that would make things worse, not better. Tamara Winter: The conversation about housing tends to be so polarized, especially online, but we’re talking about people’s livelihoods, right? I’m Nigerian, my parents immigrated to the US when I was about two months old and thank goodness they found a house in Texas where we grew up but say they had moved to New York, I think the situation would be very different or in Ireland where my grandfather worked for a substantial part of his career. Anyway, I digress. We know that house prices increasing is one of the obvious effects of restricting the supply of housing for whatever reason. But I wonder too, if you could just talk about some of the less well understood effects of restricting the supply of housing. Ronan Lyons: I mean, Ireland’s a good example of...I mean, it’s hidden and people don’t talk about it that much, but I mentioned earlier, Ireland’s really dependent on international investment or at least outwardly focused. Some of it’s indigenous and some of it’s coming from overseas, but it’s about creating economic activity for exports, right? You’re tapping into the European market. But over the last few years, the housing has been so scarce that firms have been holding back on expanding. I mean, think about how wrong that is, right? That you actually could hire an extra 2,000 people and you’re choosing not to, not because you can’t find work for them, but you can’t find housing for them. I’m not saying everywhere suffers from that, but there are, I think lots of places. If you look at New York and Tokyo over the last 50, 60 years, New York and Tokyo are roughly the same size, they have now...since the 60s, they’ve had very different setups in terms of the ability to build new housing. Tokyo is now about twice as big as New York. And people will say, "Well, New York’s big enough already. It doesn’t need to get any bigger," but the point is, and you talk to say the economic geographers, people like Enrico Moretti or whatever, and it’s the geography of where people are productive. And there are certain features about locations that make them productive and that would allow people to choose themselves if they want to move from say one part of the US to another, in order to move into a growing industry. And if housing is stopping that either internally in the US or internationally in the case of Ireland, that’s a real direct cost. I mean, housing is always in everywhere, right? Someone’s shelter, right? It’s their home at nighttime, but housing is seeping into being about livelihoods as well. And whether we are enabling people to have the most fulfilled potential that they can, that if we’re not getting housing, right? That’s for me, one of the...it’s not hidden, but it’s maybe not always highlighted, the cost of not enough housing, but it does seep through everywhere. If you don’t have enough housing... I wow my undergrads with the story that say 20 years ago, I had friends who moved out of their parents’ home in Dublin to rent a property in Dublin while they were in college, because they were just like, "Well, hey, I’m an adult, I’ll go off and I’ll find somewhere to live." That is so far from the possibility now, if you’re a 19 year old student in Dublin, I mean, you just stay at home with your parents. There’s no option. You may even have to commute. If you’re outside Dublin, you may be commuting an hour and a half every way, very early in the morning and very late at night to go to college. And that has a cost too, in terms of all sorts of things that are forgone that I took for granted when I was an undergrad that today’s undergrads can’t do. And I think they’re hidden costs as well in terms of forming people and their opportunities, because those years say between 20 and 25 are so crucial to people who are, say, in the higher education space. They’re so crucial to what happens afterwards. Everything is path dependent. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. I really appreciate that in particular, because I think it’s just poorly understood. Okay. So this is actually not super relevant to the podcast, but I’m personally curious about it. Can you summarize Ireland’s housing bubble and its subsequent crash in 2007? What happened there? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. You will see it given as an example of, well, this is almost like the textbook case of this is what happens when you let markets go wild. And I think that misses a key part of the story. Clearly the global credit gloss in the early 2000s was an important factor, but you have to rewind a little bit. And in the mid, late 1990s policy makers were grappling with this idea that Ireland is growing, Dublin is growing, how are we going to provide new housing? And they came up with this scheme that said, "Let’s regenerate parts of Dublin as Ireland’s biggest city and we’ll allow people to write off construction costs for building new homes." So it started out with this urban renewal thing, and that actually worked quite well. I mean, you had organizations that weren’t particularly familiar with building apartments, they’re used to building houses and then they were building apartments. So there might be other quality issues there that we can come back to. But overall, the goal of getting new housing, where there was long term demand was by and large met and actually rents fell during Ireland’s boom and bubble. So many new rental homes were built that rents were cheaper in 2004, 5, 6 than they were in ’98, ’99, 2000. And that’s fascinating because Irish people forget this because they just remember when the sale prices bit was through the roof. So politicians looked at this and went, "That’s interesting. So if we do this tax relief thing, we get lots of housing. So let’s try it in all the other constituencies where we want to get reelected," right? So they went off and they said, "Rural parts of Ireland, let’s get loads of housing built." And it was a no brainer for a developer because they could...the rental income didn’t have to be from the property they were building somewhere in rural Ireland. It could be from anywhere and it didn’t have to be that year. It could be, at some point over the next number of years. So they could build these properties and either good case scenario, they get someone to live in them, worst case scenario, they don’t, and they still get a lower tax bill and unsurprisingly tens of thousands of homes were built in places where there was no long term need. And at the same time you had this credit bubble, which was pushing up prices in lots of countries, the US, UK, Spain and Ireland was right up there at the fore, incomes were going up, confidence was high, banks were getting into mortgages. We had savings and loans like institutions building societies, but they gave way to the banks and the banks became the main mortgage providers, but they didn’t realize what they were playing with and they were giving people more and more leverage. So you had these two things going on, lots of new homes getting built and prices going up a lot. And then the global gloss stopped. The bubble stopped, the music stopped and then things turned pretty quickly. And the government at the same time decided to end the cost release. They were like, "Hang on, what are we doing here actually? And we should stop these release." So Ireland in around 2007 turned and went from a decade of phenomenal increases in the stock of housing and in prices, and that prices bit that was credit driven, it went the other way and prices fell by about 55% in the space of five years. And that’s like a national average. In some segments, if you’re in one of these places that got lots of extra housing, one of these rural markets, the cost of a smaller home might have fallen by 80%. And even to this day, some of those rural counties that saw the most construction relative to the number of people in those early 2000s years, housing today is still the same cost it was 20 years ago because so much was built. In Dublin, not enough was built even in the bubble years and housing is about a third more expensive now than it was in 2000. It’s certainly, not even 20 years, it went up and down and then up again. But paradoxically for...the narrative in Ireland would be that, "Well supply doesn’t keep prices under control because look what happened in the early 2000s." Paradoxically what happened in the early 2000s, when you take a step back and take out the credit bubble is a stunning endorsement of the idea that more supply makes housing more affordable because if you’re in Leitrim or Longford, which are these rural counties that saw some of the most housing built, housing is really affordable there now compared to Dublin where it’s not. Tamara Winter: And so that’s why in your Works in Progress piece, you talk about the Irish ghost towns that actually aren’t ghost towns or at least weren’t intended to be. It’s so funny because in that answer, you actually answer like the next three questions. Your dissertation at Oxford in it, you detail the various factors that affect home prices in Ireland. Could you share some of those factors? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. What I had in mind here and I guess, I’m slightly different to the standard academic because I had had that experience of seeing how policy makers worked, or at least I’d like to think I’m slightly...everyone does, right? Everyone’s slightly different. But I said, "Okay, there’s a morass of factors that can affect housing prices, but can we distill them down to the three, four, five, six most important ones? And I was lucky that I had a supervisor who sees...I’m in many ways, I’m a product of his way of seeing the world, right? My way of approaching a question like that, I like to think is mine, but really it’s, I’m inheriting a lot of his way of tackling these questions. So you could have 50 factors that drive house prices, but we were trying to come up with this list of the most important, so that we could say to policy makers, "If you’re looking at, if you want to control housing prices, if you want to see what’s going to happen next, these are the most important." And I mentioned household income, right? So if household income goes up or down and that can go up or down for a number of different reasons. One of the reasons household income went up in Ireland, say from the 90s to the 2010s was because more and more women were actively in the labor market. So instead of one income or one and a quarter income, you might have one and a half or two incomes and that will boost household income or unemployment, right? So in aggregate, the higher the unemployment rate, the fewer incomes there are per household, right? On average. So there’s a lot going on in that measure. So household income is one, household size is another. And one of the things that was under the hood at the time, and I’m focusing more on now to try and get the point across to policy makers, is that Ireland going from say a three and a half persons per household to two and three quarters, right? That pushed up prices by between 40 and 50% in the space of three decades or so. And I don’t think that’s appreciated. You’ve the same number of dwellings, but you’ve more and more households even with a similar population. And of course in Ireland’s case population was going up, household size was going down. So there’s an even greater increase in the number of households. And then there’s the supply factor, right? So controlling for all those demand factors, fundamental demand factors, the supply, and there’s the three fundamentals and you’ve got asset factors as well. And one of the asset factors is what’s known in the literature as user cost. So how much does it cost you to hold a property one year to the next? And some of that is they say expected capital gains, right? If you think your property’s going to go up 20% between now and next year, it doesn’t really matter if you have 1% property taxes or your cost of borrowing is 3%, you are going to get...you think you’re going to get this 20% gain. And that was a huge driver of demand. And then the final factor is credit conditions that how much...for a given set of savings, how much is the financial system leveraging you up? And in Ireland, like in many countries, we went from say, 25% deposits in the late 90s to sometimes 5% or 0% deposits in 10 years later. And if you think of that as in and of itself, going from 25% deposit to a 5% deposit, the same savings are going to get stretched at a huge amount more in terms of the mortgage you get given. Now, other factors come in there, but those are the five ones: household income, household size, housing supply, the user cost and credit conditions. And we put numbers beside them and said, "Okay, if you want to think about what drives house prices, an X percent increase in incomes will do this," and so on. Tamara Winter: Was it like multiple regression analysis? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So in terms of the methods, what we were using were...they’re macro econometric methods. So what you’re trying to do is run regressions where you want to maximize the ability of the data to tell you what’s going on. You don’t want to say, "Well, we’re going to assume people are this risk averse or that," whatever it might be, you want to let the data tell you as much as possible. So it makes sense on a first pass theory level, it makes sense that supply is going to be relevant for the cost of housing and incomes and so on. And you can put them in and see what they tell you. And you can also break it down and say earlier or later which factors are most important. And that was one of the punchlines at the time, which was almost 10 years ago, was that ’95 to 2001 prices increased…house prices increased a lot in Ireland, but it was a mix of lots of different things. As Ireland went from being a declining population country to a rising population, rising income country. ’01 to ’07, it was almost entirely credit conditions, right? Basically nothing else changed. Yes, supply went up, but incomes went up almost one to one to match. So that the...of the, I think it was the 8% increase on average per year in inflation adjusted housing prices, seven and a half percent was coming just from credit conditions. Tamara Winter: A comment and a question. The comment would be, I’ve never heard anybody mention the shrinking of household sizes being a relevant factor in the increasing demand for housing but it seems so obvious when you think about it. So that’s very interesting. The question would be, you mentioned something a few answers ago about the difference between New York and Tokyo, decades ago they had the same population size and now Tokyo is both much larger, but also...I mean, I don’t know how much larger, but also much denser. And I know that that... I know very little about this, but I know that’s related to the differences in how Americans are even extending it, the West tends to treat housing as an investment rather than how Tokyo in Japan tend to treat housing. Could you speak to those differences a little bit? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. And there’s a great author called Bill Fischel who’s written something called Homevoter Hypothesis and more recently had a book called Zoning Rules. And if you read Zoning Rules, he’s an economist himself one, who’s proficient in the law. And he has a good caricature of economists at the start of the book where it’s like an economist assumed that planners are just economically illiterate and stop the building of housing for some reasons due to their own preferences. And it’s like, no planners are responding to the demand for planning that when they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get reelected to do so, that people who come along and go, I will—but they won’t phrase it like this—I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes. That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way you’ve got to not dog whistle it in but you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "I’m going to price that new households," that’s a vote winner. And I think a lot of it comes from...there’s a website WTF Happened in 1971, right? There’s all these charts that suddenly just change in 1971. And we can think of lots of potential factors in there. But I do think the 1970s, the unexpected inflation in the 1970s, possibly driven by the oil price shocks or a combination of factors, including the oil price shocks in places like the US, opened the eyes of homeowners to the idea that if inflation comes along, your debt stays the same size in nominal terms and your property value goes up. So inflation is bad from a consumption point of view, but if you’re a homeowner, it’s good because the real value of your debt goes down. And we’ve known this, that’s why we had hyperinflation after World War I, countries wanted to get the real size of their debt down, just add a few extra zeros to your currency and the debt goes away, that kind of thing. But doing it for households in a mass home ownership environment, because of course what had happened between the 40s and the 70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate for potentially very good reasons. But what it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. And that was a key turning point because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet and in some ways they’re entitled to do that. If I own a home and in principle, I could go out there and actively try and minimize the new housing supply to maximize the value of my home. Now, I think that would be incredibly hypocritical of me given what I passionately believe about housing to be doing that. So I try and do the opposite. I try and argue for more housing, even though it’s not in my own interests. And the economists are laughed at for assuming people are always super automatons and rational and so on. But in my case, I’m living proof that that’s not the case, I suppose. But in general, I do think that that switch got flicked in say in the US in the 1970s and it didn’t happen in other places. And that might be because the age structure is different in Japan now, if you increase interest rates, that could be an economic spur to activity, right? Because the age structure of the population, they’re net savers as opposed to net borrowers or there’s different things going on in different countries or it could be just the way the shock is felt. The same shock, but it’s felt in different ways in different countries. But certainly if you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who were there already and secured their housing have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: It actually leads into...and I just have two more questions. The next question, which is, as you look...I find it unfortunate that, and I understand why these debates often get so charged, but I do find it a bit unfortunate and so I wonder as somebody who does support more liberalized zoning, what do you think are the most compelling arguments that opponents of liberalized zoning make? Ronan Lyons: I mean, there are...one relates to quality I think, and one relates to distribution, right? So people who...and I would have...in the Irish housing debate and people can go on Twitter and see, I would say something and you’ll have...there’s a group of people who will argue vehemently that, against say, if I argue for new rental housing in Dublin, because it badly needed, people would say, "No, the rental housing is getting proposed is not adequate." And they’ll say either, for example, either it’s not good enough quality, so we need higher quality standards. Personally, I don’t think that’s true of the housing that’s getting built at the moment. I think I’ve tried to come up with a measure of it. Of course I did, I’m an economist, but I’ve tried to come up with the measure of the quality of housing and I estimate the housing that’s getting built now about 50% higher quality in terms of the input materials than housing about 20 years ago. So I don’t think that’s true, but I’m sympathetic to the argument that if you build poor quality housing, you are creating future problems. So we should be rigorous in terms of housing. Now there’s an opportunity cost, which gets to the distribution point, the higher your minimum standards, the more of the income distribution you’re pricing out. And I estimate that say Dublin city’s minimum standards around 2015 priced at 90% of the income distribution and that’s pointless, right? It’s pointless having minimum standards that only allow 10% of people to enjoy new housing, because what you do is you create segregated markets. So from a distributional point of view, I think new housing shouldn’t be the preserve of the market or shouldn’t be the preserve of the state or whatever, I think we need a holistic approach that says, if you think of it as three groups in the population, you’ve the group that are rich enough based on current standards and prices to afford housing in the market. You have a group that are poor enough based on whatever the standards are for providing social housing, that they qualify for social housing. And then you’ve got a group in the middle who are not rich enough to afford market housing and not poor enough to qualify for supported housing. And really if I were a housing minister or a secretary, I mean, that is your goal. Your goal is to make sure that group doesn’t exist, that they’re either in the market or in the supported housing sector. And for both in order to achieve that, you need both those groups, the market housing segment and the social or supported housing segment to be responsive to underlying need. So that’s an argument where basically social or supported housing is a compliment to market housing. It’s not a substitute and I think that’s one of the...one of my get out of jail cards when some of my critics come along and say, "You’re just like a shield for developers and it’s all about profit for you." I have one guy who likes calling me a money astrologist because I’m an economist or whatever. I’m like, my estimate of housing need is high enough that I think the state should be supporting the construction of maybe 15 to 20,000 homes a year. So I don’t think...I don’t know of any competitor in Ireland’s case that has a higher estimate of socializing than me. I also have a higher estimate of market need, because I believe the underlying need say for one and two person households, as we get older, as we start our families later, all that kind of stuff is adding new housing need, diversity of housing need. So I think on quality and distribution, there are points to be listened to. I’m super reluctant to take into account…I think of this, right. I live in central enough in Dublin, I can see the Guinness tower, right? From my bedroom window. I can look at it and go, "There’s the Guinness Storehouse," which is like one of the most popular tourist attractions in Ireland. Now, it’s not particularly attractive, but suppose it were super attractive and I’m like, "That’s part of my view, right? Across the road, there’s a site that’s going to get redeveloped and they’re going to put in, I think, five or six stories in group of apartments. I think I should be entitled to say, "Well, yes, I don’t think you should build that because I have a lovely view.” Now I think that observation on the new development should be given a weight of close to zero, right? It is effectively irrelevant for society, right, that I have a view of the Guinness Storehouse from my bedroom window. It’s nice for me, I didn’t buy the property because out of the window, I can see the Guinness Storehouse or whatever it might be. I think we need to be a lot more clear about the weight we give to arguments that are effectively arguments to keep housing prices high. Tamara Winter: As you look across Ireland and then maybe more broadly across the world. Are there reasons for optimism on housing? Ronan Lyons: In Ireland, I think there are because things have been so...I mean, things were up and down for different reasons, but things have been so bad for the last 10 years that if you think of...just take the case of Dublin, Dublin is a city of about one and a half million people, about a half a million dwellings and the rental sector is about 150,000 rental dwellings, right? So not quite a third, but not far off. As things stand, they actually recognized this a couple years ago policy makers, they said, "We need to boost the supplier rental accommodation.” We are now in the opposite of the sweet spot. We’re in the eye of the storm at the moment because those plans have been lodged to build about 50,000 new rental homes but very few of them have come on stream. So you’ve people saying, "Look, you changed these rules three years ago," and of course COVID came in and didn’t help. And you changed these rules three years ago and nothing has changed. In fact, rents have gone up. Things are getting worse, not better. And I look and I see about 40 to 50,000 rental homes coming down on stream over the next five or six years. And I say, Dublin is going to be such a better city for having 200,000 rental homes rather than 150,000 rental homes. And yes, the new 50,000 are going to be expensive, but we have made them be expensive because we have high standards. And I know some people will disagree with that but I do believe that that’s true. We have high standards and the new rental accommodation is going to be expensive, reflecting that. So that’s the...I’m a natural born optimist. I see things getting slightly better and I do, and again, in the case of Ireland, I think the things were so bad in providing which you might think of as social or supported housing over the last 20 years. It was a decision in the early 1990s, implicitly, nobody ever stated this, but implicitly, it was let’s stop providing lots of social housing by the state and by lending more and more risky mortgages that we...and the US did the same thing effectively that that will step in, the market will step in for the state. And we know post 2007, that that’s not a reliable way to provide housing for all, but for about 10, 12 years in Ireland’s case, there was not a huge amount of progress. And just in the last 12 months or so, there’s been a bit of progress in terms of cost rental. So Jane Jacobs writes about this in her book about how would you provide housing for all…the Death and Life of Great American Cities. She talks about what we would call cost rental is that, if a third of your income is the most you can spend on housing, how could, what do you do for people for whom that’s not enough to cover the cost in new housing? And you got to top them up to get to that point. And Ireland is introducing a system a bit like that. And I think that’s going to make social housing or non-market housing, more responsive to underlying need. So I’m an optimist for Ireland, even though I could also give you the list of clouds in the horizon or things that I think are wrong, let’s go with optimism. More globally, if I’m an optimist it’s earlier in the pipeline of optimism, it’s hard to point generally. And it’s hard to summarize generally about housing. And there’s a couple of books actually, that I’ve seen coming out recently, one’s called Mass Housing, I think, and it’s trying to synthesize across countries. And actually some of my own work...I’m working on a project that’s funded by the National Science Foundation looking at housing prices in the US since the civil war and trying to measure prices at a city level. And in doing that and in doing the same for Ireland and in doing the same for Canada to contribute to an international, not debate, because I think that sets us up in the wrong, but International evidence base around what’s happening in housing markets now and how it fits into a longer term picture. But I’ve digressed a little bit. The drawing, I suppose, drawing conclusions about the global housing system or even the housing system in the high income world, if I’m optimistic, I think it’s because there’s a lot more people who believe housing to be important to research. And we know so much more than we did 10 years ago, so that’s on the research side, that of optimism. I think that will filter through into the policy side, but I do think that every country is going to have to come up with its own way of wrestling with the, yeah, the promiscuous veto with the power of incumbents and some of it, some countries may not be able to solve that until you’ve...things have got so bad. You’ve got a majority of renters in certain key parts of your country and then the power switches. Tamara Winter: Ronan, that’s all I have. Thank you, so, so, so much.

Archived audio: Is it for real? Oh, it’s for real now. Tamara Winter: It’s New Year’s Eve 2016. Then governor Andrew Cuomo and his wife descend an escalator underneath second avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Behind them, ride a gaggle of men in suits and women in evening gowns. Cuomo flashes a smile to one of the dozens of cameras followed by a thumbs up and a wave. They turn to board a colorfully decorated new subway car emblazoned with the words second avenue. It’s the kind of grandiose ribbon cutting moment that every politician dreams of. Archived audio: We needed to show people that government works and we can still do big things and great things, and we can still get them done. Tamara Winter: But this was no ordinary transit project. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project ever. Welcome to Beneath the Service, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our last episode, we looked at rising housing costs. Today we’re looking at what could be considered the other side of the same infrastructure coin, transit. I grew up in a suburb of Dallas, Texas. We have the Dart, or Dallas Area Rapid Transit, but its efficiency and convenience leave a lot to be desired. According to census data compiled by homearea.com, the share of commuters in the Dallas Fort Worth Metro area that use public transit is—1.4%. And that tracks with my experience. Growing up, I would take a train once in a while, but only on special occasions to the Texas state fair or the stockyards in Fort worth. Trains were a special treat, not something that was part of my main transportation diet. By contrast, I moved to New York City in 2021 and the city subway has just become a part of my daily life, as it is to 3.1 million other New Yorkers. And I learned that only a few years before I arrived, a new subway line opened underneath second avenue in Manhattan. It was a rare new addition to one of the largest and oldest subway systems in the world. Phase one of the project was completed in 2017. It is a modest two miles of track and three stations. It runs through the upper east side neighborhood. The price tag was around 4.4 billion dollars, and that’s just one of the four phases of construction. Phase two will extend the line north into East Harlem and is expected to open sometime between 2027 and 2029. The cost of phase two is expected to surpass that of phase one. Phases three and four would extend the line along Manhattan’s East side, all the way to the financial district at the Island’s Southern most point. These phases currently have no funding commitments or timelines. I guess the thing that gets me is that this subway line was first proposed in 1920, over 100 years ago. So, why has it taken so long to construct? Why is it costing so much? And what can we learn about public transit? Not only where the Second Avenue Project got it wrong, but where other places get it right. Sarah Kaufman: In New York city the subway is the lifeblood of the city. Tamara Winter: This is Sarah Kaufman. She’s the Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Sarah Kaufman: At NYU I do research, I conduct events, and I teach mostly around the topic of transportation and technology. Tamara Winter: She’s also worked at the city’s transit agency itself. Sarah Kaufman: I previously worked at the MTA, which is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority here in New York, which is the organization responsible for New York subways and buses, as well as several bridges, tunnels, and highways. Before COVID the subway was handling about five and a half million people per day. And then we also have the largest bus system in the country. And before COVID, it was handling about 2 million people a day. New York City does not function without its subway and bus systems, because that is how everyone gets around. In a lot of US cities, the only people who take buses or trains are lower income people, but here in New York you could be sitting next to a multimillionaire or someone who is very low income and everyone’s riding it together. It’s a great equalizer. Tamara Winter: Today, the subways might be the city’s lifeblood, but a quarter century before the first trains began running underground, elevated trains rumbled above Manhattan’s busiest avenues. Archival audio: Gleaming skyscrapers are traditional landmarks of New York, but there are other landmarks like the grimy ribbon of steel [inaudible 00:06:37]. Tamara Winter: They were loud, dirty, and choked the city’s street life under a canopy of metal. Archival audio: For 76 years, L trains clattered by carrying people to work and home again. But the old steel skeleton outlived its usefulness. Passengers dwindled, and so the L is being torn down. Tamara Winter: The city began phasing out these elevated trains, known to New Yorkers at the time as the L because the more modern underground subway lines were being built. Well, most of them were being built anyway. Sarah Kaufman: So the first concept for the Second Avenue Subway was published in 1920. And it was just an idea. And the city planned to start construction in the early 1930s, but as you know, the depression hit. And so there was no funding for a new subway line. Once the country recovered... Archival audio: Second Avenue. Miles of new housing need miles of new track. Sarah Kaufman: Different capital project amounts went into repairs and other subway lines and so there wasn’t funding for this project. There were fits and starts over time in the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s based on federal funding and state funding, as well as governance changes for the MTA itself. Archival audio: Much of the transportation future will be hidden below the ground in more than 50 miles of new subways. Soon, there will be a new two track subway that will run the length of Manhattan on Second Avenue, right up to the Bronx. Tamara Winter: The city did actually start construction in the early 1970s. However, New York City soon fell into severe economic and political turmoil, leading to high unemployment and rising crime. Archival audio: New York City Subway System. It has turned into a nightmare for the millions who ride it each day. The reason for the crime wave? The city says it doesn’t have the money to pay for transit police. Tamara Winter: Again, the Second Avenue Subway was put on the back burner. Sarah Kaufman: New York was left with several mini tunnels under Second Avenue, but nothing that connected and nothing that was yet able to have a train because these tunnels were not contiguous. Tamara Winter: The 1980s and ’90s saw the city crawl itself out of the fiscal hole and finally start to bring down the crime rate. In December 2001, just three months after the 9/11 attacks shook the city, research began on the impact of constructing the Second Avenue tunnels to the city and the environment. These impact statements were finished in 2004, and plans were developed for the next two years. Archival audio: One, two, three. Sarah Kaufman: So finally, construction resumed in the 2010s. Archival audio: We’re here today, starting up the tunnel boring machine, which you see behind me for the Second Avenue Subway. This is a tremendously exciting day. Sarah Kaufman: It was seen as a shovel ready project in the 2010s. A lot of it had to do with federal investment because this project was just too large for local or state investment to have completed. And so once there was a real federal commitment to transit, mostly thanks to Obama, the city was able to work on this project. Tamara Winter: That leads us to then Governor Cuomo’s grand opening gala. Unveiling a stretch of track from 63rd street to 96th street underneath Second Avenue. Archival audio: Thank you and God bless you. In a few minutes and we’re going have a great New Year. Thank you. Tamara Winter: So yes, nearly a hundred years later, the Second Avenue subway was eventually built. Well, one of four parts were built. And pre pandemic, the line saw around 200,000 weekday riders. That’s more than the entire Atlanta Rapid Transit System. So sure it’s doing its job, but then there’s the issue of cost. Sarah Kaufman: The Second Avenue subway was the most expensive subway built in the history of the world in mile-per-mile basis. Tamara Winter: The total cost was around $2.6 billion per mile. Sarah Kaufman: There’s a lot of great research done about construction costs in the US being just astronomically high. If you look at the work of Alon Levy... Alon Levy: Okay, I found the sound recorder. My name Alon Levy. Tamara Winter: Alon Levy is a transit researcher. They run the websites, Pedestrian Observations, and the Transit Costs project. Alon’s interest in transit costs started when they were studying for their PhD in New York. Alon Levy: I got an interest in the subway. It’s just a thing that people do in New York, they ride this train. And I saw, okay, this is how this system laid out and started thinking about maybe gaps in the system. What could we edit? What would we change? And somehow this has gone to trying to compare it with a lot of other big systems. And this is when I realized, just through a little bit of Googling, that the construction costs of subway construction in New York, the Second Avenue subway were very high. Tamara Winter: That led them to look at other subway projects. Alon Levy: They checked a bunch of huge global cities. Tamara Winter: Alon found that the global average cost of transit projects was around 400 million dollars per mile. The Second Avenue project was six times that. This led them to start the Transit Costs Project. It’s a website that catalogs the costs of transit projects around the world. Alon Levy: Right now we have a database, it’s something like 600 items. We have close to complete coverage of subways built in the last 20 or 25 years. Tamara Winter: The Second Avenue subway is extreme, both in timeline and cost, but it’s not unusual in the US for transit projects to fall behind schedule and go over budget. According to the Transit Costs Project, transit projects in the US are the sixth most expensive in the world. The countries that are one through five are New Zealand, Hong Kong, Qatar, Singapore and the UK respectively. However, there’s an important caveat to the data here. Digging tunnels and building underground rail, like a subway, make construction much more expensive than simply laying down rail over land. The five countries I listed are building projects that are more than 80% tunneled. New Zealand and Singapore’s projects are a hundred percent tunneled. In the US only 37% of track is tunneled. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, I would say the US performs pretty badly. It’s not that it’s without any bright spots. There are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. Tamara Winter: This is Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. Tamara Winter: We met online several years ago, through Twitter, naturally. I immediately became a fan of his insight and how he communicates his ideas about transit Alex Forrest: As with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here. It’s hard to know where to start. Tamara Winter: Culprit one: labor costs. Alex Forrest: With our construction crews, we need them to be professional trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contracts or else, what are we doing here? Tamara Winter: Here’s Sarah Kaufman. Sarah Kaufman: As compared to most other countries that have transit systems, employers in the US have to pay out worker benefits, which significantly adds to the cost. Subway construction happening in France for example, the cost would be somewhat lower because the employer would not be responsible for the health and wellness of the workers. Tamara Winter: Culprit number two: practice. You know that old saying, “practice makes perfect”? Alex Forrest: The USA had a first rate best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. Archival audio: And here’s one of the most wonderful things about this vast country of ours. No matter where we want to travel, there are trains. Beautiful, comfortable… Tamara Winter: At its peak in the early 20th century, the US had over a quarter million miles of railroad tracks. Nearly every major US city, from Atlanta to Los Angeles, had either street cars or subways that a majority of commuters took to work. For more reasons than we have time to get into in this episode, the latter half of the 20th century saw the tides begin to turn. Alex Forrest: At that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us where we are today. Tamara Winter: There’s no consistent new building of transit projects. And so everyone is all kind of out of practice. So when a new project does need to get underway, it’s like starting from square one every time. Alex Forrest: A lot of transit agencies in the US should be developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors the better you are just at the industry in general. The more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system is just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Culprit number three: transit agencies. Often in the US, a patchwork of different agencies all have different motives. Sarah Kaufman: Here in New York, and this is true in several other US cities. We have this division of jurisdictions that is hard fought. The subways and buses are run by one organization, the commuter rails, Metro North and Long Island Railroad another. Meanwhile, we have the path train, which is one of the commuter trains to New Jersey run by the Port Authority, and then New Jersey Transit, which runs other trains to New Jersey. It’s pretty incredible how many different organizations needs to come together. And frankly, they don’t. When you look at other countries, they have more of a regional and national perspective on coordinating interests across boundaries. Tamara Winter: Lastly, perhaps the most guilty culprit: Us, the public. There’s that other old saying, time is money. Well, in the case of transit projects, the longer these things go on for, the more expensive they get. These delays are often a result of NIMBYs. People who favor projects in general, but when they happen near them, they say not in my backyard. We discussed NIMBY attitudes around new housing development in our previous episode. And the same issues can be seen when it comes to transit projects, too. Sarah Kaufman: We do have a public engagement process where people can oppose transit and here in the US, people wildly oppose transit. They do not want buses and subways coming to their neighborhoods and overwhelmingly they come to community meetings and oppose it. Whereas in other places, the community has less input because it’s seen as a community betterment project. And so that process, which can take years here, is a non-issue elsewhere. Tamara Winter: Residents will often weaponize regulations such as environmental protection laws in an attempt to stop what they see as an encroachment on their neighborhoods. Alex Forrest: People are loathed to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. Trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given projects, not the least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Tamara Winter: All these factors add to transit costs in the US. Excessive labor costs, a lack of in-house planning expertise, multiple out of step transit agencies, and NIMBY’s dragging out project timelines. Part of the reason that Alon Levy started the Transit Cost Project was because they believed that if the US was able to look outside it’s borderers, the shared knowledge and learning from other global cities will help transit projects everywhere. Even New York. Alon Levy: There’s this unfortunate tendency in New York to say, oh, New York, especially, you don’t have anything to learn from. So we don’t have anything to learn from to a degree. We don’t have anything to learn from Milan. We don’t have anything to learn from Stockholm. Tamara Winter: Every transit system has things it does well and things it can improve on. But the more I dove into the world of transit, the more I realize that all roads, or all railroads, lead to one place. Japan. Tamara Winter: This is the sound of Shinjuku station. It stretches for more than a half a mile through the Shinjuku ward and the heart of Tokyo. The area is a major commercial and administrative hub. Every day it sees 3.6 million passengers making it the busiest public transit center in the world. There are five railway and subway companies that intersect here. They link the Tokyo Metro to lines that service the suburbs West of the city. By one account, there are 53 platforms and over 200 entrances and exits to this massive complex. There’s also long distance bus service. While Shinjuku is the busiest station, it’s hardly alone. There are nearly a dozen other major transit hubs spread across various wards in Tokyo. Each of these services 1 to 3 million passengers daily. The rest of the world doesn’t even come close. Take New York’s Penn Station, the busiest train station in the entire Western hemisphere. It sees over 600,000 weekday passengers. That’s one sixth of Shinjuku station. In fact, of the 50 busiest train stations in the entire world, 45 are in Japan. Train ridership can only get to these high numbers when the system runs effectively. In fact, in Japan it’s nearly perfect. Junichi Sugiyama: So desu ne. Hai, hai. Tamara Winter: This is Mr. Junichi Sugiyama. Junichi Sugiyama: I live in Yokohama, Japan. Tamara Winter: He’s a journalist who writes about train, travel and business. And he’s ridden on every single rail system in Japan. Junichi Sugiyama: Next I’d like to like to ride the Amtrack across the United States. I will practice my English to help with my travels. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Japanese people feel proud that the railroad system is so reliable and punctual, and when they can say there’s a train station close to where they live. Punctuality and accuracy is the most important thing so that people know exactly when to leave the house and when they will arrive at their destination. Tamara Winter: Let’s look at the Long Island Railroad, which operates out of Penn Station. The system considers a train on time if it arrives or departs within 5 minutes and fifty-nine seconds of the scheduled departure. Even with this generous measure, nearly 20,000 trains run late every year. Now contrast this to Tokyo. Every year the city’s entire system experiences accumulated delay of 20 seconds. Even these precious few seconds are an infraction worth an apology, like this statement that went viral in 2017. Archival audio: A company in Japan is apologizing after one of its trains left 20 seconds early. The company released a statement that reads in part, we deeply apologize for the severe inconvenience imposed upon our customers. That’s incredible. For comparison, to review [inaudible 00:24:28]. Tamara Winter: Imagine a trained company in the US making a formal public apology for leaving 20 seconds early. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: By increasing the frequency of trains, it will be more convenient for residents in the area. And subsequently, the town will develop. Ultimately, the goal is to have an accurate and efficient operating system. Tamara Winter: Tokyo also manages to integrate its various train operators very well. Here’s Alon Levy. Alon Levy: Tokyo has something very precious, which is that it manages to integrate urban and suburban transit very well. So the commuter rail lines in Tokyo run through the subway system and moreover the subway system was built to form a tight mesh within the city, but also connect with these commuter lines. So Tokyo essentially built a subway system at metropolitan scale. Tamara Winter: The system in Japan is not without its drawbacks. For example, in Tokyo the high number of competing transit companies leave riders paying with a jumble of different methods. But it’s efficient and on time, and the high quality of Japan’s transit system extends into the smallest details. Here’s Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: There’s something much more every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies. It’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. If you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: Clearly, the Japanese love their trains. And like so many love stories, it started in a time of war. Following its defeat in World War II, Japan was occupied by the American military. In Japan this is referred to as GHQ, or General Headquarters. Its aim was to establish democracy and rebuild the country Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Prior to the war, the Japanese National Railways, or JNR for short, was built and operated by the federal government. But, when the war ended, JNR was relaunched by GHQ in order to make the railway system more sustainable. Converting it into a public enterprise. Tamara Winter: The government operated railway became a government owned public corporation. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: JNR incurred a large deficit of 37 trillion yen, which almost exceeded Japan’s national budget. Tamara Winter: On top of mounting debt, confrontation increased between management and the labor unions leading to numerous strikes. Fares were up, ridership was down. It all came to a head in 1987. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The country couldn’t support it anymore. So they made a drastic reform. All of this debt was settled and the private company was created. This was the beginning of the JR Group. The corporation was split into six private passenger companies. Each was designated a different region of the country. There was also a freight and research company created. Most of the JR Group companies were granted the freedom to operate as private entities. And so they made efforts to lure back passengers. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: From the perspective of the rider, the staff have become kinder. After becoming JR, they started to focus on service. Because it’s an independently profitable and private company, they felt that they had to make a profit. And in order to make a profit, a lot of customers have to feel comfortable and satisfied. So the employee education was reviewed and the service was improved. Tamara Winter: There was also a marketing push. One example is this now famous series of JR Group Christmas commercials in the late 1980s. Archival audio: Christmas express. Tamara Winter: The train companies were allowed to capture the upside of their own service. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: It was stipulated by law that the national railway should not actually do business beyond building and managing railways. They were told that they could not invest in hotels, real estate, or super markets, as it would put pressure on private companies. However, once JR became a private company, it was possible to expand into new businesses, such as hotels, ski resorts, and real estate. Tamara Winter: And so JR Group companies had a larger financial stake in the areas around their train stations succeeding economically. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The biggest business is to use stations to build shopping centers or condominiums. The station is not just a train station, but a base for business. It’s where people gather together. So you can have a lot of different businesses there. When Japanese railways developed, they bought a lot of land at a low price first, and later put down a railroad track and then the price of the land would go up. So they would sell it. Many urban railways in Japan have operated not only as railways, but also by diversified management. Tamara Winter: Today JR East, the JR Group company that operates through Tokyo is the largest, fully privatized passenger rail company in the world. Alex Forrest: This method of assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future, which they call value capture nowadays. Tamara Winter: In fact, this is not that different from how railways in the US were built. However, there are several key differences. Alex Forrest: When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these inter urban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains. This was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation, and then you didn’t really care what happened next. That was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. Tamara Winter: And given his own background, Alex Forrest actually has a unique perspective on this. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Mishara. Once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a twenty to thirty minute walk and take the train two stops over to go to church. This train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, but it runs like eight car trains using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. At the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every 2 to 3 minutes. This is the first train that I ever rode. I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old. The stations were pretty grimy at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. The whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan and clean. From that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world. By the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America, or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s now 2022 in New York. Archival audio: This is the 96th street train. The next stop is 72nd street. Stand clear. Closing doors. Tamara Winter: The first phase of the Second Avenue subway has been running for just over five years. Archival audio: Good afternoon. We certainly meet in the most unusual places here in New York. Very delighted to be here beneath the second avenue subway. Something that we’ve been talking about for a very long time... Tamara Winter: Governor Kathy Hochul has moved forward phase two of the project, largely thanks to president Biden’s $23 billion infrastructure investment and jobs act. Archival audio: Ladies and gentlemen, next stop 125th street. With that, I’d like to introduce a gentleman... Tamara Winter: And the investment will go even further at this time. While phase one served mainly a high wealth area, phase two will extend into East Harlem, a neighborhood, largely working class and highly reliant on public transit. According to the governor’s office, 70% of residents here use public transit to commute versus the citywide average of 55%. For the people along the next phase of Second Avenue, this development would be a huge life change. And that’s the thing. Transit is the type of infrastructure with the power to change people’s daily life. Whether in New York, or a city like Dallas, where I grew up. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what’s the critical difference here, right? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. There are lots of problems in the New York subway, but just the fact of its availability, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population. You’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: In the end, I am perhaps foolishly optimistic about the prospects for a more transit oriented feature in the US. For one thing, young people are becoming more vocal about their desire for alternatives to driving. And as America continues to age, developing these alternatives will be increasingly important for seniors who don’t want to be relegated to their homes in their later years. I see bright spots like Cul-de-Sac, a new car-free city development being built in Tempe, Arizona and private companies like Brightline in Florida and Texas Central are also developing intercity rail projects in places that have long been deeply car-centric. I’m hoping we’ll see a lot more experimentation in the years to come. Alex Forrest: I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome, and it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here. It’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long. Even convincing people if they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Sarah Kaufman: America has a real addiction to cars and most of our communities are built around use of cars. And so it can be very hard to give up car usage, even if somebody tried. At the same time, I think that the younger generations in the US are seeing that and taking advantage of transit and biking and other options as better ways to get around. I hope that the interest in transit continues. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak.

I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. We’ll see you next time. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-Sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. On the most recent episode of Beneath the Surface, we focused on the state of public transit in the US, and we compared it with one of the most train loving countries in the world: Japan. For this episode, I interviewed Alex Forrest. He is currently a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. I’ve been a fan and a friend of Alex’s for years. He’s cultivated a community of trained fanatics on Twitter…train Twitter that is, where he shares his thoughts on the state of train travel in places like the US and Japan, where he lived for several years as a child. His username is @380kmh, which might seem a bit random, but it’s the top design speed for most high speed trains. In our conversation, we discussed his current work in Springfield, the formative years he spent in Japan, the history of train development in the US, and more. So here is my conversation with Alex Forrest, which has been lightly edited. I hope you enjoy. So the first question is always the hardest. Introduce yourself. Tell me your title and why are we talking today? Alex Forrest: My name’s Alex Forrest. I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. And we are talking today about transit around the world and how to do it well. Tamara Winter: Tell me a little bit about your current work as a transit planner. When we were chatting about this episode a little bit, you told me that you just won funding for two lines. Is that right? Alex Forrest: Two bus routes, right. So my work in transit is limited to bus operations. That’s the transit provider that I work for, operates out of three bus garages in Western Mass, about 35 to 40 routes. It varies a little bit by time of year. And in the past couple years, I was able to win funding from MassDOT to operate two new services. Both are kind of longer range intercity kind of services. One of them runs on a roughly hourly frequency on the Interstate. The other is just a three times a day through a state highway connecting to Worcester, it’s a service that we’ve had a lot of interest in riders from. And I’m a little disappointed that we couldn’t provide more than just these three round trips, but it was great to be able to get that running. Tamara Winter: Talk to me about the transit situation broadly in Massachusetts, and also kind of how does the transit system in the broader north-east differ from the rest of the US? Alex Forrest: Massachusetts works nicely as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country in that you have Boston, which is our north-east, I suppose. And then you have the rest of the state, which I mean, the rest of the state was settled very early. So it doesn’t necessarily have the same town patterns that you’ll find in the rest of the country. But in terms of transit availability, I think it’s a working analogy, it does the trick, which is to say MBTA is the transit provider in Boston. They run four subway lines, one of which doubles as kind of a surface streetcar route. They run a myriad of bus lines, including some nominal BRT routes. They also run ferries and commuter rail around Eastern Massachusetts. So very extensive network. One of the top performing networks for ridership in the USA. There are also, I want to say, maybe 15 or so regional transit authorities elsewhere in the state. Most of which have sort of one central city and a defined service area. And their job is to provide exclusively bus operations. Now it’s not written in, but that’s just how it works out, throughout the other parts of the state, not a bad model conceptually, but one of the oversights of it is that they made no account for travel between the regional transit authorities, which is why this route to Worcester was such a big deal. I mean, in Eastern Mass, the various regional transit authorities at least can get close to Boston or connect to an MBTA service. But beyond Worcester, that starts to become impossible and broadly speaking, the RTAs obviously get a lot less money than the MBTA. They have much cheaper services to run in the first place, but one of the consequences of this is that very few...it might only be PVTA, which is the one that I work at, very few RTAs actually offer weekend service. Most of them only offer service on weekdays. I think until recently, that was the case, even in Worcestor, which would be the next largest after us. But you will want to look into that. I’m not sure, they might have started running weekend service recently. Tamara Winter: It’s kind of wild though. You said this is sort of a microcosm for the rest of the US. Talk to me about how you would rate the US public transit system kind of compared to other countries specifically in regards to rapid transit. And when you decide on a rating, I’m curious why the US merits that rating. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, just because that is an admittedly pretty high bar, and so a lot of countries are still working on that or don’t really need to, I would say the US performs pretty badly. I don’t know about a out of 10 score and it’s not that it’s without any bright spots, but just there are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. As far as the analogy goes for Massachusetts, one of the issues is that transit is very much a localized affair. And so where it exists at all, you might have reasonable transit, but anywhere else as kind of a national system, it’s sorely lacking. So connections between city areas are probably the worst component in the USA. And then within cities, there are various other issues just concerning schedule availability. Like I talked about the no weekend service, that’s hardly unique to Massachusetts, it’s true all around the USA. Even some rail systems. I want to say the Los Angeles commuter rail, I’m not convinced they run on weekends, or if they do, most commuter rail systems which do run on weekends, offer greatly reduced service. So, they prioritize specifically the times when they think it’s most likely people will ride. Which again, that sounds very reasonable, but that’s not actually the best way to run a transit network and we have empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. So we don’t need to be led by assumptions there. Tamara Winter: To ask maybe a silly question, because there are theories that I can see, for example, for why this is the case. The US developed much later than its peers, the decision-making power to create transit, particularly between cities is kind of difficult to, I guess, manage because of our Federalist system. Why is our transit so lacking? Alex Forrest: As you kind of suggested, it’s definitely one of those path dependent problems. The system is lacking here just because we sort of evolved this way through various small decisions. But the part of the reason we’re lacking now is because we’re actually very, very far ahead of the curve, about a 100 years ago. And it’s not quite as simple as the success went to our heads and we thought nobody could do it better than us, and so if we can’t do it well, we don’t even need to bother. It’s not quite that simple, but that’s definitely part of it. And the USA had a first rate, best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. But even before that, even before the early 20th century, there were some fundamental problems in how we developed our system. And those problems led to complications when the original developers of railways and local transit networks in America started to run into cost issues, not entirely just because of a lack of business, but also because they were hamstrung in their ability to set their own fares. A lot of municipal ordinances would require transit providers to operate a flat fare across an entire region, which is not best practice. You really want to charge by distance traveled. And also, that flat fare was limited. At the time, I think it was a nickel or a dime, just because we’re talking about the 1920s, ’50s here. The inability to raise fares to deal with drops in revenue kind of ensured that the old railway operators couldn’t survive and a handover would be necessary. So then we get to kind of step two, which is the mid-20th century handover when a lot of the trolley companies were replaced by bus companies and the intercity private railways got out of the passenger business entirely with the formation of Amtrak. And so at that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us to where we are today. There have been various attempts, no shortage of money spent, although at the same time, kind of not enough, it’s complicated. I guess you could say they spent the money on not the best things for keeping the system going. And even to this day, a lot of baked in costs like that, just from the way we’ve done things so far. I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome. And it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here, it’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long, even convincing people they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Tamara Winter: It’s funny, if we were re-cutting a trailer for the podcast today, most of what you just said would be kind of a prime target for it, because I think this is kind of the crux of creating infrastructure. From the outside, as I’ve been talking to people, whether they’re building new cities, so talking about kind of what is it about Lagos that would necessitate a new city? Or for example, the Salton Sea and its potential to be kind of a lithium mine, it’s interesting. There isn’t kind of one culprit for why things aren’t better than they are or why some things worked. It really does appear to be kind of pack dependence in inertia all the way down. And you add into that, infrastructure typically doesn’t have...it needs a policy entrepreneur, but it’s very difficult to kind of just make large scale changes even when we know what it is we need to do. And I guess speaking of cost, you kind of mentioned this in your last answer. I’m curious, if you could elaborate, in your experience, why are transit costs in the US so much more expensive and why does it take so much longer to develop transit in the US than in other similarly situated countries? Alex Forrest: Before I get started, I want to just break down the two main sides of cost in transit. One being the operating expense, just to pay the drivers, maintain the vehicles, keep the service on the road. And then the other being capital expense, which would be to replace the vehicles, get new ones to build any stations, garages, any kind of train service requires capital expense on its track. Both are more expensive in the USA, but the operating costs are, I would say, a lot more defensible by and large. They’re not perfectly defensible. There’s some problems there too. Really, it is the capital costs that are the biggest problem. It’s the large infrastructure projects. Those are the ones where the costs are just wildly inflated. And again, as with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here, it’s hard to know where to start. There is the kind of NIMBY angle where people are loath to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. So it’s trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given project, not least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Part of it has to do with staffing and what, I guess, I can only call unrealistic agreements with labor. Which, again, this comes back to the inertia thing, it’s obviously critical that we have well paid and compensated drivers for any of our vehicles. You don’t want people crashing on the road. And likewise with our construction crews, we need them to be professional, trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contract. What are we doing here? This is a problem that Japan had a crisis with in the late ’70s to 1980s, which ultimately led to the privatization of their national railways. There were various causes, it boiled down to a labor dispute and they were able to work it out and solve that issue back then. So yes, in the USA, right, we have just regulations. People’s ability to interfere with the project can ramp up the cost tremendously. We have relatively expensive labor, not even the expensive labor is the issue, but the overstaffing, where you just have way more people on a crew than you particularly need to do it. This also shows up in transit operations where you might have...the practice of having conductors on a train to pick up tickets is definitely not the way they do it in Japan, for example, where either if a train line is so quiet that you can’t just have fare gates at the station, then the driver of the train will check the tickets instead of having another guy wander around to do it, needless to say, those are only on the quieter rural lines. So I guess that’s only two subjects right now. There are more, I don’t even want to get started on the EBA and requirements for environmental impact statements, which, again, depending on how zealously the jurisdiction wants to push the issue, they can take years, if not...I don’t think any have taken more than a decade. Tamara Winter: Well, speaking of a transit project that took more than a decade, this episode begins with the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, which was first proposed, I believe, in a little over a 100 years ago. I wonder, are there other transit projects you can think of in the US that have similarly been extremely, exorbitantly expensive and also taken forever just to get off the ground? Alex Forrest: Yes. I think, frankly, you would’ve a much harder time finding projects for which that isn’t the case. I know that just recently in Boston, there’s a lot of celebration as a extension of the Green Line into Somerville, Mass opened. This goes to Union Square in Somerville, which is very close to where I lived in the mid ‘90s, living just on the border of Somerville and Cambridge. So it’s very heartening to think that finally, my old neighborhood has its own stop. I don’t remember the exact year, but I do remember when this project was being discussed back in at least 2004, if not earlier, I think versions of it have been on the drawing board since at least the 1940s. This particular round was finally authorized and it began construction sometime around also 2004, I want to say. And it was originally slated to open in 2011. So here we are now, it’s part open. There’s still more of it to open, which I think will open later this year, but they haven’t even finished opening it yet. And I’m as happy as the next guy that it’s finally here, but well over budget. I mentioned neighbors getting involved to just jack up the costs. Sometimes that does produce nice fruits, even if it does inflate the cost significantly. In this case, it involved connecting to a multi-use bike path, which branched off the Green Line Extension. There was already a bike path branching off it. They just wanted to run the bike path parallel to this new extension and connect it into the larger city bike network. A nice addition, but again, not strictly related to this project, did not need to get bundled in, inflated the timelines and the planning process, led to constant revisions. And so finally, here we are, halfway through 2022 and we’re not even done opening it. Tamara Winter: By Second Avenue Subway standards, that’s actually very, very impressive. But, of course, we are grading on the world’s biggest curve. Alex, I’ve known you for a few years and you have kind an unusual story with how you came into transit. Tell me a little bit about your unusual childhood and why you got so interested in transit in the first place. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were still kind of moving around quite a bit and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. This was in 1991, and I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Machida. And I would describe Machida as on one hand, very much a suburb, outside the city proper, mostly single family housing, but also, it has nearly half a million residents right now. And it’s got its fair share of large buildings as well. So it’s a suburb, but a Tokyo suburb, to be clear. Anyway, living out there for two years, I was about old enough to go to preschool. I attended a preschool a short walk from my parents’ apartment, but every week, once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a 20 to 30 minute walk, shorter on a bike or a bus, and take the train two stops over to go to church. And so this train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, it’s far out in the suburbs, I don’t know, maybe 15 miles away from Tokyo, I’m not sure. But it runs eight car trains, using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. And that’s where the local stops at the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every two to three minutes. So to have this out in the suburbs, this beautiful train, this is the first train that I ever rode, of course. And so if you look at Japanese culture, there’s certainly a carve out for the train nerds. They’re generally photographers. They like to take photos of trains and they know everything about them. I can see why kids growing up there would do that because the same effect hit me. The only difficulty was I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride. I was so happy. I didn’t have to abandon trains forever. The downside was they were American trains and that did not at all dim my enthusiasm as a five-year-old, six-year-old kid. I still loved riding them, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old, the stations were pretty grimy, at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. Just in general, the whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan, and clean. So anyway, just from that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world, just always taking the chance to ride it whenever I can. But by the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s so crazy because the way you talk about Japan, I literally thought you had grown up there for many, many years. It’s amazing that all it took was two years and two of the most formative years in your childhood for you to kind of catch the train bug. Alex Forrest: Right. Well, and I have siblings as well and they didn’t quite catch the bug either. So it certainly depends on the person, but it was, I guess...you said it best, it was a very formative time in my life. And so those at the stage when I was just beginning to form memories, so basically, my earliest memories are of living in Japan, but I was also not so young that the whole thing was a blur. I had pretty concrete memories, for instance, of our trip on the last day when we were heading to Narita Airport, I remember the train we were on because it had a nice LED animated map showing the route we were going. And so I was just mesmerized, I could check off every station as we stopped on it and see the train in advance. Tamara Winter: You mentioned that you could clearly see, even at that age, the differences between US trains and Japanese trains. In your opinion, what are some of the main, maybe social and cultural differences that affect kind of how the US and Japan treat public transit? Alex Forrest: I think Japan has a reputation for very good manners and that’s incredibly well-deserved. In general, Japanese people are just very polite and they’re very social in public. They’re not going to make a mess in general or make a lot of noise or have a loud conversation, which is just kind of broadly refreshing, but hard to really imitate here. As far as kind of attitudes, social and cultural attitudes, there’s also sort of the impression that...and I mean, it helps to be on the cutting edge of the technology to do this, but there’s something much more glamorous and just every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies, it’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. Part of the reason that any reformers had any leverage here was that the public expected and demanded better service of the railways than they were delivering at that time. I’m hard pressed to come up with any more...you’ve heard the saying, "Why take a shower? I’ll just get dirty again." Tamara Winter: Yes. Alex Forrest: When, in fact, the point of taking a shower is precisely because you will get dirty again, so you want to be clean until that happens. I feel like that is kind of the attitude just as far as general maintenance goes. When I’m in Japan...I was visiting some years ago, I went to my old train station and they just had a guy...he was a part-timer apparently, but this is a very common thing there. They just had a guy walking up and down the staircases at the train station, just wiping down the banisters and walls, in the middle of the afternoon, it was 2:00 PM. He looked like he might have even been a retiree, which is why I gathered he was a part-time worker because senior citizens will often end up taking just odd jobs like that. But the fact that they actually have a position for this, you’re the guy who just wipes the station down every few minutes or so during the afternoon, they probably have another guy for the evening. But that kind of constant maintenance, much more so than people’s cultural inclination not to litter, is what makes the difference there. I feel like despite the well-deserved reputation for manners in Japan, people also tend to forget that they’re just human. People absolutely do litter there and they’ll leave things behind just out of forgetfulness, of course. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. Just if you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: There’s something kind of interesting too. I don’t know the extent to which Japanese people just care more about their services, but it does seem like they expect more of their services than maybe we do. You can see those differences, we don’t have to just look at Japan and the US, even in say Dallas, where I grew up, and New York, where I live now, in Dallas, it’s expected that you really only ride the light rail if you need it as a connection downtown, let’s say you work downtown or just, if you can’t afford your own private transit, whereas in New York, I wouldn’t say it’s like Japan in that it’s totally ubiquitous, but it’s pretty ubiquitous, right? It’s not unusual to see people of very different kind of socioeconomic statuses riding the train together. And so even in the US, you can kind of see, and people in New York, of course, are accustomed to, and sort of demand much more. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what is the critical difference here? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. And as you said, it’s not necessarily as useful and ubiquitous as in Tokyo, although certainly, it comes closer than anywhere else in America. And it’s also, certainly not as well-maintained as what you have in Tokyo. There are lots of problems with the New York Subway, but just the fact of its availability. As terrible as these trains are, as dirty or as overheated or whatever the problem is, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population, you’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Whenever a new bus route wants to get proposed, you’ll usually have some interested party who says, "Ah, we need bus service here. There’s a lot of jobs here. There’s a lot of houses here." And generally, in this assumption is not just that there’s a lot of jobs or houses, but, "There’s a lot of low income houses here. We need a bus here." "Oh, there’s a benefit center here. We need a bus to go there." And so if you have a bus line that only goes between those two places, between the low income apartments and the Social Security offices, that doesn’t particularly do a good job of addressing the needs of people in those apartments or those offices, let alone anybody else. The people in those apartments also need to go to the doctor. They also need to go to the grocery store. They also would like to visit friends. These are all trip purposes that are being completely ignored in the calculus of where to put the bus and you can solve all these issues if you just stop thinking of, "Ah, we only need to worry about these particular people who are going to ride." No, you have to think about anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: I love that tagline. If there’s a person, there’s a potential rider. I want to talk about Japan a little bit more. Can you explain sort of briefly...although I don’t know if this is a brief kind of question, how Japanese rail companies operate as private companies? You’ve mentioned this earlier, but specifically around real estate speculation and development. Alex Forrest: It’s actually not that different, at least superficially, from how a lot of the railways in the USA were built up. Although there are, I think, a couple of critical differences that I hope I can get to, but the premise of the land use speculation really was something that happened around the time that the cities were still growing. And the railway industry was still pretty new in Japan, but you had suburban streetcar operators in say early 1900s Tokyo and Osaka. Some of which became quite successful and began running what in America, we would call interurban lines, which are not mainline freight, but they basically have the same standards in terms of their heavy rail operations. Generally running electricity, even for the USA back then in the 1900s. But in America, the interurbans all ultimately got shut down more or less, a few survivors, modern transit lines. But in Japan, a lot of them were founded as private companies. Most of them were able to stay as private companies and gradually phased away from streetcar operations to focus on their interurban lines, which over the years, were extended, branches were added, through service onto the subways was added. And so these interurban lines evolved into modern suburban rail. These are for companies that remain private the entire time. Japan also had a national railway industry, which originated as an amalgam of government funded lines and privately built lines, was run by the Imperial Japanese government through the war, and then by the reconstruction government after the war, and which was ultimately privatized in 1987 and broken up into several subsidiary companies. So the premise is you build a line out of the city, you develop the land around that line and therefore you plant passengers for yourself who will then use your line to go back and forth to the city. This is indeed how a lot of rail in America got built too, at least at the commuter level, not necessarily at the intercity level, but one of the most critical differences that a lot of people who are interested in this method, which they call value capture nowadays, assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future. When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these interurban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. Cannot emphasize this enough. If you look at a suburban operator in Japan, yes, they are invested in land use. Yes, they do take steps to make sure that their own ridership will be there, but that’s not the part which makes them the money. That’s just the background work. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains or buses. And this was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation and then you didn’t really care what happened next. You’d have a success where they take over the company. And that was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. And so, I think, that at least was part of why you had these interurban operators and streetcar operators in America running into trouble. I don’t mean to say it’s entirely their fault either. We cannot underestimate the impact of having tons of cars on the road, since a lot of American transit operators didn’t have dedicated rights of way, and so they’d be slowed down by anything that got in their path. But that’s also to say, I don’t want people to think it was entirely the evil car companies that did this. There were some really serious structural problems with American railway operators, which really doomed their efforts in the passenger rail business. Might have been overcome, but would not have come from the railways themselves, I don’t think. You would’ve needed a government intervention, which was a very, very tough sell and remains that to this day. Tamara Winter: That’s kind of the natural next question for me. So you say you might have an operator in kind of a regional line or a smaller line. Yes, they might invest in land and they might be speculating, but that’s really not where they make their money. How does that model compare to how transit agencies across the US are expected to function? Are there any US agencies that work like that? Alex Forrest: I don’t know if you could say there are any agencies that work like that, but there are, at least recently, some prominent private railway companies that have started operation. There’s Brightline in Florida, which is a private intercity railway line, which is, as far as I know, doing its best to develop the areas around its stations. You may be familiar with the term transit oriented development. Anyway, Brightline has taken advantage of value capture and TOD to build up its station areas. This is why they’re so interested in Miami and making sure their station location is close to downtown. Unlike the Amtrak Station, which is more peripheral. I know that Brightline is attempting to add a high speed line to Vegas from near LA. I’m not sure where that project stands. I just know that many operators have tried to do that route and the latest ones to step up to the plate are Brightline, so I wish them the best. The other one is actually a Japanese venture in America, where one of the companies that resulted from the breakup of the Japanese national railways is currently invested in developing a high speed railway line in Texas, between Dallas and Houston. In America, this is called the Texas Central Railway. It’s a subsidiary or partner company for the Central Japan Railway, which operates the busiest high speed line in Japan. The one from Tokyo to Osaka. And generally, as operations are, rural operations in Central Japan and commuter metropolitan operations around Nagoya, Japan’s third city. Tamara Winter: That’s one I’ve been hearing about for years. I didn’t realize it was a Japanese company behind that, which gives me a lot of hope for it. Alex Forrest: That has definitely improved my impression of the project as well. At the very least, I understand that the people who are working on it are technically very knowledgeable with literal decades of experience running the busiest high-speed railway in the world, whether or not that will be able to translate to Texas is still kind of anyone’s guess. But I don’t think you could find a better crew to do the job ultimately. Tamara Winter: Tell me, what do you think are the lessons and learnings for the US, as you kind of think back to your own experiences in Japan, and then now as a transit planner yourself, what do you think that US cities should aim to learn from the way that many Japanese cities operate transit? Alex Forrest: As far as learning from Japan, I’d already mentioned about planning for a general population. That’s pretty critical, but just as far as operations go, I think I would encourage them to not give up on the concept of farebox recovery. Even the most ardent transit advocates in America will frequently drop the line that there’s no transportation service that pays for itself. And this is where the reference to the Japanese providers, not only making their money from value capture is very important because usually the people who say that no system is profitable, will bring up the value capture argument to hand wave Japan’s example away, but that’s literally not true. A lot of these are publicly traded companies. You can look up their books and see where they’re getting their money from. I’d make a point to check the Odakyu Fact Book whenever they update it, which is once a year, that’s the line that I used to ride when I was a kid in the suburbs there. So we can confirm that it is indeed possible to make more than 100% of your operating costs from your fares. And the question is just, how do you do this? And there are so many ways to approach this that just don’t even get entertained because in America, they don’t think it’s an ideal worth pursuing. They don’t think there’s any finish line to that race. They think if you start focusing on your farebox recovery, you’ll never hit a 100%. You’ll waste a lot of time. You’ll have to make austere cuts on anything that isn’t profitable immediately. That’s really not how this works, really. If you’re only making 10% of your budget from fares, think about what you can do to get that to 20%. That’s not much, you don’t need to raise your fares necessarily, right? You might just need to change your fare structure. You might offer a discount on passes, which gets people to buy passes more often, which gets them to use the system more often. And then, hey, they don’t always have a pass or they might not ride the pass as much as the pass is paying for. And so you’re still making more money than if they never rode at all, right? Put it like this. If you buy a monthly pass for $50 and $50 pays for, let’s say, 30 trips on the bus, and you only use that monthly pass 20 times, transit operators has made a lot more money off those 20 trips than if they were all sold individually. And so, little steps that can be taken to improve farebox recovery. It’s not just about raising revenue, it’s also about reducing your costs. Obviously, you don’t need to change your fares at all if you can come up with a way to bring your operating costs down by, say, 5%, right? Again, it’s just that they don’t even entertain the idea that you could ever hit 100% profitability that they won’t take the smallest step in that direction. On the contrary, a lot of providers are talking now about trying to go fare free, which I admire where that’s coming from, but I can’t say that that would work out very well for us, even in the medium-term, let alone the long-term. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting because in the same way that a lot of the challenges that you see in infrastructure are not things that have a single cause, similarly, if you wanted to kind of fix sort of broken systems or even systems that are just operating suboptimally in some regard, these little changes...I wouldn’t necessarily think, "Oh, if you’re making 10% of your operating costs, maybe try and make 20 in revenue." That seems very doable. And I guess, as you look across the United States, do you see pockets of optimism? Alex Forrest: Yes. Not the least of which is my own local situation. It was nice to get a couple of routes approved. One of them’s doing badly, one of them’s doing well, but both of those were what I expected when I went into this. So I guess just things are going as expected there. Tamara Winter: Tell me again, just what did you get approved? And congratulations by the way. Alex Forrest: Oh, thank you. Thank you. And I should emphasize, I did not work on these grant proposals alone at all. So I had the collaboration of my great coworker over at PVTA, the director of planning over there. But one of the routes was a thrice per day, five days a week weekend-focused service, connecting Amherst, Mass. and Worcester Mass. The other is a roughly hourly to half hourly service along Interstate 91, between Northampton, Holyoke, at the Holyoke Mall and Downtown Springfield. Like I said a minute ago, the Springfield one has been a success. The Worcester one, not so much, but both are extremely well received. And the shortcomings of the Worcester route, I was well aware of when I went into designing the schedule with the very limited funds that were on the table. We, again, at the end of the day, only provide as much as people pay for, which is one of the reasons I think it’s so important that transit providers try to maximize their farebox revenue because the more your riders are paying for you to exist, the more you will be responding to the needs of your riders in continuing to exist. When you get all of your budget from state allocations, taxpayer funding, that money is just as good as any other money. The problem is that you have to address the concerns of the people giving it to you in order to get it. And their concerns may or may not line up with the actual interests of riders. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. The more of your money is coming from riders, the less likely you are to get paid to do something you wish you wouldn’t do, which happens all the time, I got to say. Tamara Winter: It’s a bit of a principal-agent problem. If the money isn’t coming from people that are actually using the service, it may or may not be useful. Alex Forrest: Right. Essentially, you’ll always reflect the priorities of whoever’s paying you to do your job. You want those priorities to line up with the users of your service, ideally, but as far as pockets of optimism, there are a lot. I think the thing which has had my attention the most in the past few years has been this phenomenon of bus network rationalizations. There’s a well regarded transit planner called Jarrett Walker who runs a private consulting firm, which I would say specializes in these network redesigns. Some of the fruits have been great. One of the first cities they went at was Houston. I know they’ve also done work in at least Miami, I want to say Seattle, and I want to say Rhode Island as well, at one point, or they might be doing Rhode Island now. I don’t quite recall, but these redesigns, essentially, they aim to have a cost neutral redeployment of existing resources. So you have X number of buses. You can pay X number of driver hours and X amount of fuel. Could you, just by changing where the buses are running, get a more effective system? Focusing on allowing people to transfer outside the central hub, as well as the central hub. Having services more frequent on more routes, even if that means having slightly fewer routes. The routes that you have will be higher quality. They’ll more consistently attract people to them because they’re more useful. And so this tendency doesn’t seem to be losing any steam. More and more cities are picking it up. The results have been very good where they’ve been attempted. This was pre-COVID, so I don’t know what happened after that, unfortunately, but pre-COVID, I do remember that any articles that would decry the general crisis of transit ridership in America would have to overlook Houston, which despite being a generally bus network, was actually improving its ridership at that time, while most of the country was struggling and losing ridership year after year, and it hadn’t been doing so before the redesign. So something clicked there and I want more cities to get this opportunity. I’ve taken a crack at it in my spare time, looking at our local network, but I don’t know. I feel like I’m maybe a little too in the weeds to do a good job. I’m already too accustomed to the usual special demands, special concessions, that I can’t quite bring myself to say, "Ah, well, rationally speaking, we shouldn’t do that." I know these guys too well, they’ll come yelling at me the next week if I mess it up. So it can be nice to have some outside eyes looking at it. At the same time, I think another thing that a lot of transit agencies in the US should be prioritizing more and some of them are, and doing a very good job at it, is developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors, the better you are just at the industry in general, some of these Japanese suburban railway companies, one of them in particular, happens to also be one of the largest manufacturers of rail cars in Japan. So they make trains for themselves, but also for other companies in Japan and also around the world. Again, just the more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system. It’s just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Alex, this has been honestly a delight. It’s crazy, I’ve known you for years, but I feel like I’m just meeting you again for the first time. It’s really wonderful to know that there are people working, not just in kind of the big transit systems, like in New York or in WMATA, in DC, but also in places like Springfield. And I appreciate so much that you gave us your time. Alex Forrest: No, thank you again so much for having me. It’s been a pleasure. It was great to catch up. We should definitely talk again soon.

Okay, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Archived audio Commercial: Why you eating a mint, baby? So I can kiss you on the face. Why? Because it’s National Night. What? Tamara Winter: That’s an ad for Mentos, the breath mint. It’s also kind of an ad for Singapore. It was launched in 2012 to coincide with Singapore’s National Day. Archived audio Commercial: I’m talking about making a baby, baby. You ready? Let’s go. Tamara Winter: National Day is celebrated on August 9th, the day that Singapore gained independence after separating from Malaysia. Traditionally, it’s marked by fireworks, official speeches and a massive parade. Archived audio Ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome our cabinet ministers, senior ministers and deputy prime minister to The Float @ Marina Bay. Here come our cabinet ministers streaming into the… Tamara Winter: Dignitaries wave flags and the prime minister gives a National Day address, a little bit like the State of the Union in the US. In fact, in 2012, the same year as the Mentos ad, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong discussed Singapore’s falling birth rates in his address. Archived audio Lee Hsien Loong: But alas, we are having too few babies and therefore we have a problem. The long-term trend is down, but we cannot give up. We’ve got to do something about it. Married couples are having fewer children. On average, now, each married woman has two kids. Previously, it was more, so this number has also been coming down. Tamara Winter: So, Mentos to the rescue? Archived audio Commercial: It’s National Night. Let’s make Singapore’s birth rate spike. Birth rate ain’t going to spike itself. Singapore’s population, it needs some increasing. Tamara Winter: In the US, we aren’t used to ads like that, or to hearing politicians talk about these issues in the way that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong does, even though similar trends are at work here. The birth rate in the United States is also falling. Personally, I’ve always been drawn to these questions about populations. Birth rates, changes in the age of a population and what those numbers might mean. It always felt like a natural fascination to me. See, I grew up in a large family, and when I say large, I mean large. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you I don’t even know precisely how many cousins I have, and that’s just first cousins. Who knows how many second or third cousins I’ve got running around out there? And even though I haven’t met all of my cousins yet—they’re scattered across a few continents—I feel extremely fortunate to have an international support system that spans generations. I also want to have my own kids someday. And by the standards of most people my age, I want to have a lot of kids. But of course, the decision to have children is intensely personal. It’s also one that governments around the world try to influence in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. So I wanted to understand what impact these kinds of personal decisions can have at scale, and why governments have so often tried to influence their citizens when it comes to having children. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press, exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. So far on the podcast, we’ve looked at a lot of physical infrastructure: housing, transportation, cities, container ships. But why do we need all this infrastructure in the first place? People. It all comes down to people. So, in this episode, we’re looking at how a country’s population, its size, its growth or lack of growth, are perhaps the most critical infrastructure. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about populations. What happens when governments try to influence population growth and size through policy? Countries around the world put policies in place that influence their citizens’ reproductive choices. The United Nations Department of World Economic and Social Affairs keeps track of these policies. In 2021, their report listed 143 governments with fertility policies intended to either raise, lower or maintain population size. For example, Kenya has had government-led efforts to slow population growth since the 1960s. These programs, which began by providing basic contraception and family-planning information, evolved into healthcare systems for mothers and infants. By contrast, Hungary has recently made headlines for a distinctly different goal. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has spoken openly about wanting to raise Hungary’s birth rate, which is among the lowest in Europe. In 2015, the Family Housing Allowance Program created subsidies that increased based on whether a couple was married and how many children they had. The most benefits were available to married couples with three or more children. But Hungary has actually had policies in place to raise birth rates since the late 1940s. One country that has tried to both speed up and slow down its population growth through policy is Singapore, first by discouraging citizens from having large families and now by pursuing pro-fertility policies. So with that Mentos ad still ringing in my ears, I set out to understand what it was like to live with these ever-changing policies. How did people having kids in Singapore experience their government’s evolving attitudes towards procreation? Titus: My name is Titus. I’m 69 years old now. I have been in the government service for 25 years with the Housing and Development Board in Singapore. So that’s a little bit about me, and my wife and I, we have three children. Vimala: I’m Vimala and I’ve been a teacher all my life, taught for about 30 years, 35 years. Titus: We’re both born in Singapore and we have lived here for all our lives. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala have seen both sides of Singapore’s policy on family planning. Vimala: We lived through the times when we had this policy of “Stop-at-Two” family planning. Tamara Winter: After World War II, Singapore’s population was rising rapidly, much faster than its economy was developing. Even the introduction of family planning in the 1940s didn’t slow it down. In 1950, the population was barely more than one million. But by the time of independence in 1965, it was almost 1.9 million, close to double. Add to that, Singapore is a tiny island nation. It’s just 281 square miles. For comparison, the city of Los Angeles is about 500 square miles. A booming population, little room for expansion. So by the early 1970s, the government took action. Titus: You know, during our teenage years, I think the Stop-at-Two policy started somewhere the early ’70s. Tamara Winter: 1972. Titus: And we were our teenage years at that time. Vimala: No, it was early twenties. Titus: In our twenties, sorry. We were in our twenties at that time. That’s the purpose of the policy, to reeducate you on what is right and then what is wrong. I thought it was quite intuitive as well. One child, the child will be lonely. Two children, okay, he’s got a playmate. Three, if some mistakes are made then you have three. Tamara Winter: The Stop-at-Two policy, a combination of incentives and disincentives for families. Vimala: We got married in 1980. So my first child was born in ‘81, and after I gave birth immediately, I think the next day, the nurse comes to me and asks me, "What plans do you have for family planning?" So it was very strict at that time, and they wanted us to keep at two. So if you stopped at two, you had a lot of incentives. Like, they got us at places where it mattered a lot to us, which was the housing and health. If you had two children, both the children would get X number of dollars in school for them. But if you had a third child, then the third child would have nothing, that sort of thing. Titus: So you had to fund it yourself. Vimala: Yeah. Tamara Winter: Along with the policies came an aggressive PR campaign. Vimala: Maybe it was kind of a propaganda. There were campaigns, and very sadly, you’re told, "Two is enough," and "Because of two, you get X number of things." And so after a while, and we were young at that time, maybe in our late teens, early twenties, and then you start to see that, eh, it makes sense. Actually, I remember this poster very, very vividly in my mind with the father, mother and two daughters. And they say, "Boy or girl, two is enough." Tamara Winter: And those posters were inescapable. Titus: Once you have a government policy, the posters are everywhere, in government offices. Vimala: Bus stops. Titus: Public places, bus stops. Vimala: Yeah. Malls, everywhere. They just have different versions of it, but the idea is the same. Tamara Winter: Some other posters from the time directly promoted more drastic measures like sterilization, calling it "the best method for family limitation." Vimala: So if you stopped at two and if you sterilized yourself, the lady, she could get the best school for her child, whichever school she wanted for her child. And also the family could stay in some of the better areas in Singapore. So it was a very serious thing then, and most people adhered to that policy of "keep at two." Titus: Some of the ladies, actually, were sterilized, though of course, they took the more drastic action to stop at two. Many years later, when the government started encouraging people to have more children, there were some bad feelings that, "You had actually prevented me from having more children and now you’re telling me to have more children." So there were some of these undercurrents. Tamara Winter: So the Stop-at-Two policy in Singapore was more than just economic. Sterilizations took place on a mass scale with a peak of more than 10,000 procedures carried out in 1976. The Stop-at-Two policy was far from the only effort to limit population growth in developing countries. China’s one-child policy, which was put in place in 1980, is probably the most well known, but countries like India also put similar policies in place as far back as the early 1950s. But these kinds of policies often came at a heavy cost. One that has disproportionately impacted women. In Singapore, mothers, afraid they might be unable to bear the costs of a third child, were forced to make permanent, life-altering choices about their bodies. This was also the case on a much larger scale in China. Millions of women were sterilized as part of the government’s efforts at population control. Others were forced to undergo abortions. In some rural areas where there was a long-standing preference for male children, female infants were abandoned. And as a result, in China today it’s estimated that there are nearly 35 million more men than women. In economically-developed countries, the notion of having fewer children by choice gained traction, starting in the late 1960s, sometimes with an environmental argument attached. This anxiety about the world’s growing population was in large part because of one extremely popular book written by a husband-and-wife team. Archived audio Johnny Carson: It was about 10 years ago this month that Dr. Paul Ehrlich made his first appearance on the Tonight Show, and it elicited probably more mail than any guest at that time we have ever had on a show. It had to do with his book, The Population Bomb, and it was a major factor in launching the ZPG, which is zero population growth in this country. And since that show, he’s done about 25 shows with us. Tamara Winter: The Population Bomb, coauthored by Paul and Anne Ehrlich, was a sensation. Published in 1968, it predicted famine, drought and mass death due to overpopulation, all within the next 20 years. These ideas weren’t entirely new. Economist Thomas Malthus made a similar case in his 1798 book, _An Essay on the Principle of Populatio_n. But it was Ehrlich’s writing that brought these concepts to a broad, contemporary audience. Some paperback copies of The Population Bomb carried the typewritten warning, "While you are reading these words, four people will have died from starvation, most of them, children." Ehrlich’s argument, "Let’s make sure that the existing population cannot just survive but thrive before worrying about adding more people to the planet." Here he is in 1980. Archived audio Paul Ehrlich: We have a little over four billion today. Large numbers of them are undernourished. We don’t have enough energy to go around. People think the environment is deteriorating and so on. Why don’t we try doing a really good job with four billion people, see if we can do that? Tamara Winter: The legacy of this book, for better or for worse, lives on today. In 2019, a statement on the need for climate action, endorsed by over 11,000 scientists, was published in the Journal of Bioscience. One of the statements’ recommendations: stop global population growth. Now, the methods of population limitation proposed in this statement were mainly about personal choice, like increasing access to family planning services. They were not advocating restrictive government policies, but the anxieties that Ehrlich brought to mainstream attention are present. So I wanted to know, what is the state of population growth like today? I called up Clara Piano. Clara Piano: Alright. So my name is Clara Piano. I am currently an assistant professor of quantitative analysis at Samford University. My area of research is family economics, although I’ve also published in the history of economic thought and the economics of religion. Tamara Winter: In addition to being an expert on family economics, when we talked, she was also about to become a mom. Clara Piano: Yes, yes. I am eight months along with our first. She’s a little girl, and it has convinced me that no one is ever ready. I just really do feel like it’s been a privilege to not only be researching what I find most interesting, which is how families form and function and interact with society, but to be living it right now as well. Tamara Winter: So I asked her: is the world’s population still growing? Clara Piano: The world’s population is increasing, although much less than it was in the past. Tamara Winter: World population growth reached a peak in the 1960s. Since then, it has fallen. And within the next 100 years, the world’s population is actually projected to shrink. Researchers like Clara are keeping a close eye on these global trends because unlike Erlich, they see potential in a growing population. When we talked, she referenced the work of economist Julian Simon. Clara Piano: As Julian Simon would say, the ultimate resource is people. And of course, there are values of people beyond economics. I want to acknowledge that completely, and he does as well in his work. But basically, it comes down to the fact that people are not only hands. They also have brains and they have ideas, and population growth, even from the economic perspective, is not just a replication process but a diversification process. So the people who are being born now are going to have different ideas of how to do things that will generate technological progress, which is actually the source of economic growth. Tamara Winter: This is another view of population growth also captured by economist Michael Kremer in his 1990 paper, Population Growth and Technological Change. The paper is worth reading in full, but the takeaway is that as populations increase, so does technological advancement, which in turn increases economic growth, and more concretely, raises living standards. So population growth can possibly be a key to solving the existential challenges that Erlich described: like food and energy scarcity, and climate change. The theory goes, if there are more people out there trying to solve big problems, more possible solutions can be found. Shruti Rajagopalan: You live in New York City, right? That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, where ideas multiply. That’s what we really need. Tamara Winter: That’s Shruti Rajagopalan. Shruti Rajagopalan: I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emergent Ventures grants program also at Mercatus. I’m a fellow of the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU Law School because, in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. Tamara Winter: Her research on developing economies is rooted in India, a country with a massive and growing population. Shruti Rajagopalan: So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of a hard number to even imagine. The United States, for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people. So the Indian population is 18% of the world. Tamara Winter: India is projected to surpass China as the most populous country in the world within the next decade. While a growing population can put stress on a nation’s infrastructure, Shruti sees India’s numbers as one of its greatest assets. Shruti Rajagopalan: India already has the resources of a large number of people. Now we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other. The ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce, globally, is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: But not all countries are growing so rapidly, and some aren’t growing at all. So the fundamental question remains: how to ensure that people can have the number of children they want to have. Here’s Clara Piano. Clara Piano: So this is the billion-dollar question. There is an element of mystery about all of this, in terms of the declining populations around the world. However, there are some things that we know. We do know that as people have become more educated, particularly women, we see lower fertility, and this could be a variety of reasons. Some people think it’s better knowledge about family spacing, fertility decisions. I, from an economic perspective, the most compelling reason for me seems to be that just the opportunity of the cost of their time increases. Tamara Winter: With the kinds of economic benefits that Clara and Shruti describe in mind, by the mid 1980s, Singapore was changing its policies. Titus: The reversal in policy to have more children came in 1986. I think. Tamara Winter: It was in 1986 that the policy officially changed. As a snarky headline in the New York Times put it, "Singapore decides it wants lots of children after all." But the policy change didn’t happen overnight. Titus: 1984, the thinking was already quite clear. They started this graduate-mother scheme, graduate-mother policy, where if you are a graduate mother, you get more incentives— Vimala: School, education. Titus: For education for your children, tax incentives, including subsidy for even hiring a foreign maid. These were some of the incentives that were given for graduate mothers to go out and work, and also to have more children. At that time, anyway, there was a belief that smart women produce smart children. Tamara Winter: The shift wasn’t just from Stop-at-Two to, everyone have as many kids as you can. The new policy slogan was: have three or more, if you can afford it. And even then, the government preference was for highly-educated women to be the ones having children. The slogan and program were a little harder to distill in a soundbite than Stop-at-Two. It also had to convince a generation that grew up with Stop-at-Two messaging. Vimala: Among my siblings, we’re the only two who have three kids. All the rest have two. Even my brother, who married twice with each wife, he had two children. So it’s just like, "Oh, that’s the best number. It makes sense." Tamara Winter: When thinking about the intuitive power of Stop-at-Two, Vimala recalls a family night out at a restaurant. Vimala: When I had my second daughter, she kept telling us, "Oh, four of us, that’s just fine." I still remember we were at the restaurant, she said, "You see, there’s a table for four? That’s just nice for us." And so when I told her I was having my third one, she wasn’t happy at all because she felt that was really not the plan. So I think all of us had that in mind. We are very subtle... there’s subtle messages that they sent to us. Tamara Winter: Skeptical parents were only one of the barriers to Singapore’s new policy efforts. Another force was at work, a result of the country’s rapid economic growth over the years that the Stop-at-Two policy was in place. In the field of demography—the study of human populations—one of the major concepts is what’s called the “demographic transition.” This is the name for a phenomenon that has been observed in virtually every country around the world: it describes the shift within a country from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth rates and low death rates. There's an ongoing debate about what exactly causes this transition. Social and economic development—things like improved sanitation and better education, especially for women and girls—are correlated with declining fertility and increased longevity. The result: a more slowly growing population and an aging one, sometimes even one that shrinks. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, Singapore’s economic development was rapid, moving it further along the journey to, you guessed it, demographic transition. Since then, Singapore’s population has continued to grow, but the rate of growth has slowed and is projected to continue falling for the foreseeable future. So what does it mean to have an aging or declining population? Well, for starters the costs of supporting such a population can strain national budgets. And put more financial pressure on younger working-age people to support the elderly. Both individually and through expanding social programs. There’s also quite a lot of evidence that aging populations are less dynamic. And more hostile to new ideas. So as Singapore was going through its own demographic transition, it decided to work against the trend with policies that encouraged fertility. Some thinkers are encouraging economically developed countries to fight the demographic transition. To understand more about why Singapore and other countries are concerned about slowing population growth rates, I called up Matt Yglesias. Matthew Yglesias: I’m Matthew Yglesias. I write a newsletter called Slow Boring. I’m a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center, and I wrote a book recently called One Billion Americans. Tamara Winter: If you’re on Twitter, you probably didn’t need that introduction. The full title of his book is One Billion Americans: The Case For Thinking Bigger. And Yglesias certainly thinks big when it comes to the United States population. Matthew Yglesias: In some way, the population is the most important infrastructure of all. We’re talking about tripling the population density of the United States in this book. That would put us on a par with France. We’d be at about half the density of Germany. Most of the country is not unspoiled wilderness. It just has room for more people in it. Tamara Winter: He argues that a larger population in the United States would be beneficial to more than just technological development. Matthew Yglesias: I think it also matters for innovation and for culture that, part of the strength of the United States is that a lot of people come here to try to pursue their biggest dreams. And that can be technology entrepreneurs. It’s also movie directors. Like, if you do really well in New Zealand cinema, you get to go make a movie in America because we have a big audience, we have a big enterprise here. Tamara Winter: That New Zealand cinema example feels especially on point. Just a week ago, while we were finishing this episode, the biggest movie in the world was Thor: Love and Thunder, directed by Taika Waititi, who got a start making indie movies in New Zealand and had his international breakout with a mockumentary about vampire flatmates in Wellington. Now he’s in Hollywood making Marvel movies and scheduled to write and direct a Star Wars film. In his writing, Yglesias brings up a particular statistic, that many women in the United States end up having fewer children than they say they want. Matthew Yglesias: What’s interesting, though, is that in the ’70s, there was a really big decline in how many children American women said they wanted to have. For the past 20 years, you have not seen that decline in intended fertility, but actual completed fertility has kept ticking downwards. Tamara Winter: Listening to Yglesias, I was reminded that Clara Piano, who we heard from earlier on this episode, made a similar point. Clara Piano: Educated women in developed countries, in particular, have the highest fertility gaps, which essentially means that, although they say when they’re around age 25, "I’d like to have, maybe, three children," on average they end up having two. So that’s a pretty big gap and it’s, for me, a signal that there’s something going on that we don’t really understand. Tamara Winter: So what can governments do? Clara offers an answer that touches on some of the physical infrastructure discussed in previous episodes of this podcast. Clara Piano: At the end of the day, I think that, really, just the best way to think about this is to increase freedom quite literally. Because women and men, in general, are saying, "I would like to have more children." There are some barriers that are preventing them from having children, and so just basic things like increasing economic freedom, labor mobility, freeing up people to fulfill their plans, whether or not that’s economic or for their families. For housing, to be able to move and to increase the supply of housing so we can have rooms for the children. These are more promising approaches. Tamara Winter: So what does this look like in practice? The promising approaches Clara mentions point towards options beyond government policies aimed at directly encouraging or discouraging citizens from having kids. Maybe the problem is that people are being prevented from having the number of children they say they want because of rising costs of living, housing, social support, or any number of other pressures. So while building more housing, further expanding the child tax credit, increasing labor mobility, ensuring paid maternity and paternity leave, and promoting workplace flexibility might not solve every problem—I think they're policies worth pursuing anyway. Back in Singapore, Titus and Vimala ended up having three children. And though their third was born after the Stop-at-Two policy ended, there were still challenges and a lack of support. Vimala: When I had my third child in 1990, I had no maternity leave or whatever. I didn’t get a salary for two months if I decided to go on leave. Tamara Winter: Luckily, they have the kind of financial stability that allowed them to feel comfortable having a third child. Titus: Well, for us, actually, we were about to get married. Our idea was we would have children and, of course, at that time it had been ingrained in us two children. That was proper number to have. Even if we had three, we did not have an issue with that. We had our two children. First child was born in ’81, second one in ’85. And then, five years later, we were blessed with a third daughter. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala are both well educated and have stable jobs. The financial incentives and disincentives of the Stop-at-Two and have-three-or-more-if-you-can policies were a part of their lives, but they didn’t have to change their family planning decisions because of them. Today, they have three grown daughters with families of their own. Vimala: My mother was maybe my role model. My mom was a housewife and she worked, she was a very hard-working housewife, so I used her as, "Okay, I want to be a bit like her also." Because I read a lot, I’m a literature teacher, teacher of English and literature, so for me, having three girls, I tried to impart quite a lot of things that I enjoyed in my life to them, like poetry and taking them to plays. Seeing them come full-circle, like having their own families, I think that in itself is a joy. Titus: Yeah. I suppose when they were young, of course, there’s the joy as they developed and progressed. Achievements in school, achievements in other areas of art or whatever. That brings joy to us. And as my wife said, when they found their life partners, you know… Tamara Winter: Reflecting on the various policy programs he’s seen over the last 50 years in Singapore, Titus remains optimistic about the country and the future. Titus: We have lived in a fairly strict country. The standard of living is reasonably good. Salaries are reasonably good. And I think we are quite happy to have been born and living in Singapore. Tamara Winter: And Singapore continues to promote policies that support families that have more children. In 2008, paid maternity leave was increased to 16 weeks. And in 2013, one week of paid paternity leave was added. The government also offers tax breaks, housing subsidies, and even cash payments. Maybe this set of incentives will be enough on its own, or maybe, in 2022, the government will still be looking for all the help it can get and we’ll see a return of the Mentos ad. As we’ve been researching and preparing this episode, I’ve been saying that this one is for the mothers, because when it comes to decisions about having kids, the people who carry them for nine months are often the ones who pay the highest price, physically and economically. And I hope to be one of those people. So while it’s easy to get lost in the economic theory or the global-level demographic statistics, this is personal for me. And so many aspiring parents around the world. And very, very real. The kinds of policies we’ve been talking about in this episode could directly impact my life when I have kids of my own. Vimala didn’t receive paid time off to have her third child. The United States, where I will likely have my children one day, is one of the only industrialized nations that does not have a national standard for paid family leave. But what years of research into the causes of declining fertility rates have demonstrated is that economic policies, even very generous ones, aren’t necessarily enough to move the needle on birth rates. Extended families, communities and other layers of social support also really matter. They certainly did for my family. And at least in my circles, this fact is increasingly acknowledged. Some of my friends are even making concrete plans to raise their children together. So I’m hopeful. Hopeful that there can be policies and social structures in place that ensure everyone has the freedom to make their own independent choices about how, when and with whom to have children.

Original music for Beneath the Surface was composed by Auribus. Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the most recent episode of the podcast, you heard a brief snippet of my interview with Shruti Rajagopalan. She is a Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center and leads the Indian political economy research program and Emergent Ventures India at Mercatus. In our conversation we discuss not only the economic implications of India’s population growth, but also she gives personal insights into India’s history, sharing some of her experiences growing up in socialist India and witnessing its economic transformation firsthand. So here is my conversation with Shruti Rajagopalan which has been lightly edited. I’m going to have you first introduce yourself and your relevant affiliations. Shruti Rajagopalan: That is relatively easy. I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emerging Ventures Grants program, also at Mercatus. I’m a Fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU law school, because in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. I host a podcast called the Ideas of India, which is an attempt to bridge the gap between academic ideas and political economy, real world problems in India. And my main area of research is writing about Indian political economy, more specifically, my training is in public choice economics, law and economics, constitutional economics. I’m a very classic George Mason University trained economist. So, that’s all my affiliations, I think. Tamara Winter: Wow, is what I’ll say. Wow. Shruti, I want to start off with some context about India. So, how big is India, both in size and population? And I’m curious, for somebody who doesn’t have an immediate picture of how large India is, how does it compare to the rest of the world? So I think it’s something like 17% of the world’s population? Shruti Rajagopalan: Exactly. So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of hard number to even imagine, right. The United States for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people, right. So, the Indian population is 18% of the world. Having said that, India is a very young country, right. So the median age is about three to four years lower than most developing countries and much lower than the developed Western world, which has an aging population. It’s the second largest country, in terms of population and barring natural disaster or existential risk, nuclear war, asteroid hit, it’s likely to be the most populous country in the world. It’s the sixth largest economy just because the size is so large. I think nominal GDP is about 2.7 trillion US dollars, something like that. Having said that, in terms of GDP per capita, it’s still relatively a low to middle income country. It’s about $2,000 GDP per capita. Just as a point of comparison, China is about 5X the GDP per capita of India. South Korea is about 15X, right. And the United States is about 30X. So, in terms of being rich, it’s great to have a very large country, but it’s even more important that it’s a very large number of people who are also very, very prosperous. Tamara Winter: I actually want to add one more question for context. So, I was born in Nigeria, we’ve talked about this a little bit and I saw a tweet forever ago, basically pointing out the futility of talking about a country like Nigeria as though it were one country, something like 200 different ethnic groups within the country. And I wonder to what extent is this also true of India? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. I mean, I think Nigeria and India are great examples of this kind of diversity, but also how difficult it is to paint the country in one color. So just as an example, Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest state in India, it’s the size of Brazil. The smallest state in India, Sikkim, is closer to the size of Bhutan, which is like a really small Himalayan Kingdom country, right. India’s richest states like Goa, which is a great place. All the tourists love to go to Goa. It has a GDP per capita closer to Jordan, right. And India’s poorer state, Bihar is closer to Haiti. So, that’s basically the difference, right. And there are some Southern states like Kerala, which have...great on human indicators, 100% literacy rates. Again, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are relatively poor, they’re barely at the halfway mark. And in terms of linguistic diversity, there are 18 or 19 official languages, but they’re technically thousands of dialects. Very similar to Nigeria in this sense. The caste system is another point of fragmentation. There’s a lot of religious fragmentation, of course. Hindus are the majority in terms of population, about 83%, but it’s about 13, 14% Muslims, right. It’s one of the largest Islamic countries in terms of absolute numbers. I think it’s the second largest. So, in terms of religious diversity, caste diversity, ethnic diversity, it’s really, really big. You’d love this, the Cambridge economist, Joan Robinson, she once said that, "The frustrating thing about India is whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true." And I think this is really true also of Nigeria, in the sense, right. Anything you can say about one tribe, you can get the exact opposite example in another end of the country in a different state, in a different city. So I think that point is very well taken. So India, when we say...it’s just, I’m talking about a geographical boundary and a state entity and a certain kind of common culture, a democratic framework, those are things that hold Indians together, but you’re right. We got to get specific really quickly with countries like India. Tamara Winter: Well, now that we’ve said that, we’re going to zoom back out then. For anybody who hasn’t read How India Can Use Its Numbers, your excellent article, could you maybe summarize the argument and tell folks the context in which it appeared? Shruti Rajagopalan: I grew up in socialist India and at that time, the economic rates of growth were relatively low, but population was growing really quickly, because post World War II, with all the advances in medicine and infectious diseases or battling infectious diseases, suddenly you saw infant mortality drop, you saw people living much longer lives. There’s this huge boom in population. But if the size of the economic pie is not growing, it means you’re basically redistributing the same size of the pie with more and more people. So in this context, it becomes very easy to have a Malthusian point of view, which is people are the problem, right. Wherever you look, you think in terms of zero sum games, because that’s how socialist economies operate. There isn’t a positive sumness that comes from create and openness, but also, all the infrastructure is crumbling, right. There are too many people. Every time you need to get on a bus, you see that you got to elbow 15 people to even get on a bus, right. Or school admissions, right. Every single basic public service that you use, whether it’s roads congestion, whether it’s water runs out the moment you go to the public well or the public tap. So these kinds of problems led people to blame population and the government intervened in so many different ways. At one point, even policy called for sterilizations during the undemocratic time of the emergency. But usually, more benign ways of essentially reducing the population, right. And this has led to, I think, a basic misconception. We need to bring the focus back now that India has liberalized and now it’s actually a trading economy, it’s plugged into the global economy, that more people are actually a good thing, right. So as Julian Simon said that, "People are the ultimate resource." right. And why do we think people are the ultimate resource? I think that’s the insight which is a little bit harder for people who come from the Malthusian point of view. And this comes to why or where we think economic growth comes from, right. And it’s not coming from just more physical resources. Economic growth comes from new ideas. Tamara Winter: We take for granted the idea that having a large population is beneficial. You and I are doing this interview in the United States. You’re from India, I’m from Nigeria. So I’ll ask you directly, why is having a large population beneficial? Shruti Rajagopalan: This is a great question and it’s unintuitive to most people, right. Because most people just think, "Oh, there are more mouths to feed," right. Especially in socialist economies or developing countries, but economists and more and more economists who worked on growth theories, whether it’s Paul Romer or Michael Kremer, right. Their idea is that the central or the key to economic growth is new ideas, right. New ideas are more important than just some form of capital, physical capital or labor or something else, right. Once you recognize the power of ideas, the value of the population comes into focus, right. People, especially well educated people, healthy populations, smart, creative people in a space where they’re constantly bumping into each other, are the source of not just new ideas, but also how to combine these new ideas into more and more and more applications and that is really where economic growth comes from. And this is not just true of today’s tech economy or Silicon Valley or something very specific, right. Michael Kremer has this great paper, it’s called Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990. This is a generalized trend for all of human history. And you can even see this, you go to small island countries for tourism or something like that, you’ve seen that these populations can tend to stagnate. They need outside people to come in and trade with them all the time, otherwise they do stagnate, right. Whereas large connected populations, you live in New York City, right. That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, right. Where ideas multiply. Matt Ridley has a great phrase, he says, "Where ideas can have sex," right. That’s what we really need, right. So now fortunately, India already has the resources of a large number of people, right. Now, we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other, their ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce globally is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: Shruti, in your article, you identified, I think it was three policy areas in which a large population could, if utilized well or if allowed to flourish, could really unlock other gains. What were those policy areas? Shruti Rajagopalan: Yeah, so I’ll tell you a little bit about India before jumping into the policy prescription, because I think it’s important to also specify the problem. So, as I said, the people exist in India, right. And India thankfully, is a democratic country with free movement, so that is a wonderful thing, unlike China, right. That’s the closest example of a country which has large numbers of people, but they’re not allowed free movement, free assembly and so on. But in India, there are a few really major problems. The first is that India’s internal market is completely fragmented. One of the reasons the United States has been such a huge economic success is the United States was one of the first and largest free trade zones. You can trade anywhere within the United States. That never quite happened for India because states had a lot of different taxation regimes. They used to have internal tariff regimes. If you’re shipping apples or banana chips from one state to another state, you have to not only pay tariffs and taxes, but the differential tariffs and taxes come with a lot of corruption, long lines at highways where bureaucrats and corrupt inspectors can extract lots of bribes from you. That was the economy, and that naturally fragments the economy into smaller and smaller parts. And the greatest losers in this are obviously the poorer states, right. Because they’re kind of getting cut out of the market. So the number one thing is how to make sure that India’s internal market stays unified. So for this, the Indian government already took one step, which is unifying the tax regime, right, from this splintered, many-state system to a unified value added tax, it’s called the goods and services tax, but they did it the Indian way. It has eight different tax rates. It’s very complex, it’s a complete mess. So, if they streamline that, that’s going to be a huge improvement. India also needs far better infrastructure and this is where the good news is. We know that if India unifies a single market, there’s going to be so much more trade and therefore, so much more revenue for the government that actually, the additional infrastructure is just going to pay for itself, right. It’s not a net loss to build more roads, right. Or to build more ports or railways and transportation systems, coal storage, warehousing. These are things that will pay for themselves, so that’s one major part of it. The second is India’s labor market is a complete disaster, right. And this is, again, goes back to the socialist history of...there are just about, I think 40 or 50 federal level labor laws and regulation, and every state has its own rules and own regulation, which means at any given point, if you’re a countrywide firm, you have to follow 200, 300 different codes of regulation. And there’s a labor inspection system, which is of course, very corrupt and can completely extract rents, but what that does is it makes it very costly to hire people in a labor surplus economy, which is a terrible, terrible thing. And therefore, and you’ll be familiar with this from the Nigerian experience, it gets pushed into the informal market. And what I mean by the informal market is that it’s basically just escaping taxes and regulation, right. There’s nothing poor quality of the informal market. My engagement ring, I’m showing it to Tammy right now, comes from the informal market, right. So you can have very high quality, very, very expensive jewelry, leather goods, artwork, all this manufacturing happening in the shadow of India’s regulation. And what that does is it doesn’t allow it to scale, right. When things can’t formalize, they can’t get access to credit. And more importantly, in the labor market, people can’t get gainfully employed in sensible jobs that are salaried. They’re basically working daily wage labor, right. So this really needs to get fixed. 80% of India works in the informal economy. So they need to be brought back in a way out of the shadows, into the light. And the only way to do that is to deregulate in a meaningful way, countrywide, so that it becomes very easy to hire labor and it becomes very easy for actually people to invest and develop their skills. And the third thing is India, for its state of development, got connected to the internet, right, very, very quickly. This has again, got something to do with its numbers, right. When you need to lay the pipes, right. Or to put down the infrastructure for internet or telecom connectivity, a very large size market helps, right. Because very large number of subscribers means that you can put in the capital expenditure required to lay the pipes. So in India, that happened really quickly. I believe 816 million people are connected to a mobile phone in India. So it has fantastic mobile phone penetration. I think three out of four households has at least one phone. So the household has access. And that means that...and data is so cheap in India that I believe at one point someone was telling me, I met someone who used to work at HBO and they told me that Game of Thrones is super popular in India, though, it never launched by then. Everyone was watching it on torrent or something because data and streaming is so cheap in India that HBO decided that, "Okay, this is a very large market. We need to simultaneously start releasing this in India because there’s this huge fan base." So I think because India got connected, a lot of the network goods as we call them, this is platforms, right. Especially...I mean, you work at Stripe, so you completely understand what I’m talking about, but even more basic, like Twitter, Facebook, any kind of platform good, Uber, all this has a massive market potentially in India, right. People should get used to how you and I speak because more and more stuff on Netflix is going to sound like you and me, right. Because that’s where the eyeballs are going to come from in the future. So I think this is an underappreciated insight and for some things, you just need more eyeballs, right. For things like subscription services, for things like Twitter. For some things, you also need purchasing power. So as India gets richer, then more people are also going to use Stripe Press, right. Not just Stripe, right. As India gets more educated. So I think this is an insight that’s really valuable. So these are three areas where massive amount of investment is going to help India in a meaningful way. Tamara Winter: I’m curious about the 1991 reforms in India and what effect they had on the Indian economy. Shruti Rajagopalan: Oh, this is great question and my current passion project. So, I should plug this because we run a project called the 1991 Project at the Mercatus Center right now. It started last year in July on the 30th anniversary of the reforms and the website is the1991project.com. So basically, India was a socialist economy and was increasingly growing more and more socialist, since let’s say about World War II until 1990. That meant that India was basically hugely impoverished, right. And there were years or decades when the rate of economic growth didn’t even keep up with population growth, right. So there were years of negative GDP per capita growth. And this was obviously not sustainable, but in the late ’80s and early ’90s, what actually brought the country to crisis was a balance of payments problem, right. India simply did not have enough currency to afford its huge imports, especially its oil imports and energy imports, and it didn’t export enough, right. It didn’t have enough foreign exchange. So it was this crazy economy where a lot of short term debt and ballooning interest payments, which could basically topple the currency and therefore, in a meaningful way, bring down macroeconomic stability. So something had to be done. And those years, the IMF and World Bank used to have something called the Washington Consensus and they would have this long list of prescriptions for countries who were going through this macroeconomic crisis. We’ve known about this in the East Asian countries or Latin American countries. India had had similar talks and exchanges before with the World Bank and IMF when this didn’t succeed, but in 1991, something very curious and interesting had happened. A lot of the people who were in the Indian government at that time had gone and seen the growth miracle in South Korea, in Taiwan, in Singapore, right. They had been to Western countries. They had worked at the World Bank and IMF as technocrats. They had studied in American universities and they brought back this idea that, "Hang on, markets and trade are not such a terrible thing." So there was a major shift away from these hard entrant socialist values towards, "We need to open up trade." So what India did in 1991, I’ll give you the Cliff Notes version and those who are deeply interested can go to the website, is it reduced import tariffs, it devalued its currency, right, in a meaningful way, and when I say reduced import tariffs, I mean, some of the average rate of tariffs was I think 155% and the highest tariff rate was over 350%, right. So it started bringing those down in a sensible way, so now people could actually import, and this is again, not so intuitive. If you can import better, you can export cheaper, because your imports just became more efficient and higher quality and so on. So India’s total, entire chunk of trade as a part of GDP started increasing. India started getting richer. But on the other hand, another major reform that happened was India had crazy industrial licensing. The kinds that you read in economic textbooks that are talking about the socialist calculation problem. The Indian Planning Commission would tell its industrialists or entrepreneurs, how many bicycles they can produce, how many Vespas they can produce, right. How much paper can be produced or printed in a given year? So this import controlled economy where they were told what they can produce basically became a shortages scarcity economy, right. Long lines for everything. Overnight, industrial licensing was completely eliminated in India by end of July 1991, except a few select industries where they controlled some things. This basically...I mean, now you say that, "Oh, you can produce as many bicycles as people are willing to buy?" And you can imagine the gains that just unleashes, right. So these were some of the reforms that happened that brought India out of a very strictly controlled economy, internally and externally, and integrated it to the global market. And I’m a huge beneficiary of it. At the time, I was seven, eight years old when the reforms happen and overnight, I went from choice between two chocolate brands, which weren’t even that good, now there were dozens of different kinds of chocolates I could eat, right. And Michael Jackson, who my sister adored and I adored, used to drink Pepsi, and now, we could get a Michael Jackson CD, right. We could buy a CD player and we could get Pepsi, which is what he used to drink. So my memory of liberalization is also very visceral, right. Even as a kid, I knew that something major’s happening and my life is so much better. Of course, I come from a very privileged, upper middle class background, but for poorer people, it meant shortages and lines went away. When they’re standing in line for their rations, now they’re no longer getting terrible quality. Now, they’re actually getting good quality rations or they’re getting better t-shirts to wear because they were imported from China or Taiwan, right. I mean their clothing bill just got cheaper, when people are very poor, that matters. So at every level, right. It brought this huge change in India and we’re working on a year long project. We are recording oral histories with technocrats. We’re trying to understand why these ideas changed. We’re trying to show the growth that it unleashed. India went from an economy that was growing at 3% or 4% to an economy that eventually started growing at 7, 8%. And for 25 years, India grew...sustained at about 6 to 7% on average per annum, and it has lifted 270 million people out of poverty, right. That’s the size of...it’s like creating a new prosperous country almost, right. That’s an extraordinary achievement. So, I think the 1991 reforms, after Indian independence from colonial powers, if there is one major thing that’s happened in India to make everyone’s life better, globally and for Indians, it would probably be that moment. Tamara Winter: I mean, that’s incredible and I encourage anybody listening to go to the 1991 Project and also, to keep following your work. Could you speak a little bit more to how the Indian government reacted to perceived overpopulation? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. So, it started in a benign way, right. It initially started with education programs. We need to tell people to have fewer kids and that sort of thing. And a lot of those educational programs were linked to women’s health, right. This is a huge stress on women, right. This kind of reproductive stress. Then, there were campaigns that encouraged more people to adopt birth control or use condoms and things like that, right. So at that stage, and this is all pre-AIDS, right. So this is not use condoms for safer sex, this is use condoms to birth fewer children, right. So this was what was going on in the heyday of socialism under Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who was then prime minister, at one point, India suddenly moved from a democratic to an authoritarian regime for about 22 months. This was the famous episode of the Indian emergency. So India called a national level emergency and civil liberties were completely disrupted or no longer guaranteed and the government became very oppressive, right. The entire opposition of India was jailed. One of the major policy programs at that time, which her son initiated in her name, was for sterilization. And they would just capture young men, young military age men, peak reproductive age rather, and they would take them away to these clinics and make them forcibly have this procedure. So it was just crazy for a little while, right. And it was obviously a hugely unpopular move. It went away immediately after the emergency. India has never done anything that terrible since the late 70s, but it did happen. Now, I want to talk for a minute about some of the unintended consequences. So in a poor country, which has a relatively high birth rate or fertility rate, and this is mixed with very high son preference, right. Culturally, countries like India and many countries in Africa too, including Nigeria, son preference. I mean, this is not uniform, but there are parts of Nigeria, there are parts of India where son preference is incredibly high. So not only should India have more people, it should have a lot more women. So this is one of the unintended consequences. I think this as a policy regime, has now been...it’s gone completely out of vogue. It comes up, some politicians will bring it up. In Uttar Pradesh recently, they said, "Oh, we need to limit to two children." Something like that, but this is no longer a major war cry of the socialist era. And I think there has been a lot of learning from China’s forced one child policy and how now it has this aging demographic that can’t quite carry...the next generation can’t quite carry the weight of this skewed demographic that’s going to age. So I think that is a learning globally, that you need to walk away from these very strict population control policies and I think India’s learned something from it. Tamara Winter: I just have two more questions because I know I’ve taken a lot of your time. To what extent does immigration matter for India, whether that’s in-migration or emigration? Shruti Rajagopalan: I think hugely. Indian diaspora does incredibly well abroad, right. And I mean, America’s a great example of this. There’s a fantastic book by Devesh Kapur and Sanjoy Chakravorty, it’s called The Other One Percent, right. And it’s basically talk about how the Indian diaspora in the United States is one of the most high performing groups anywhere, even within the States or anywhere in the world, right. So in terms of outmigration, Indians have done very, very well abroad and they have assimilated very well in a lot of different cultures. I think that really matters, right. That there is a group of people who are entrepreneurial, who are well educated and are syncretic and who can assimilate. In terms of in-migration, India’s neighboring countries, depending on which neighbor, may or may not have porous borders, right. So with Bangladesh, it’s a very porous border. In fact, there are millions of daily wage workers who cross the border, work in India and go back. Now, this is going to be lesser and lesser of a phenomenon, because I believe Bangladesh’s GDP per capita just overtook India’s, right. So as Bangladesh gets richer, we are not going to have an in-migration issue with daily wage labor, it might even be out. It might be Indians crossing the border to go to Bangladesh to look for work. In terms, but a lot of the borders are very, very strict, because it borders with China and there are conflict areas or it borders with Pakistan, which has been a very long running conflict area. So because of that, you don’t have this foot movement across borders, but India for all practical purposes has a pretty open immigration regime. It’s just a question of who would wish to come and work in India and naturally assimilate in that environment. So, it has to be someone who is...it’s very easy for someone who is English speaking, relatively elite, gets very easily plugged into the formal part of the economy. It’s quite easy to move to India and immediately find work and things like that. And India has so many examples of people coming in as BBC reporters and just staying back, right. Because they’ve assimilated almost too well. On the other hand, if you are looking to come from some of the poorer parts of Asia or Africa, it can be difficult to integrate into a country if you don’t know the lingua franca, and India is so specific in terms of its caste and religious and linguistic relationships that it’s not easy for outside groups to just immediately mingle on say, a factory floor or just come and buy agricultural land and become a farmer or something like that. So, the very typical migration that you see from an even poorer country in India to come to India and start picking cotton or something like that, you don’t see much of that happening in India. And as a percentage of population, it’s a blip. India has just got so many people that migration is not the route that changes numbers, meaningfully. Tamara Winter: One, I appreciate so much that you took the time and we’re both optimists, I think, and I wonder, to close this conversation out, what are, to your mind, the most potent reasons for optimism about India’s future? Shruti Rajagopalan: Lots and lots of people, right. And lots and lots of people who are getting better and better and get integrated into the global economy. And this is because of India’s own regime of relatively free speech, democratic systems and access to the internet. So, I should give you this example. Recently, I like collecting a lot of Indian art, especially tribal art. I bought a particular piece of art, it’s made on textile. It’s called Mata ni Pachedi. I can send you the picture and it’s by a wonderful artist called Sanjay Chitara. I hope I’m saying his name right, and he’s from Gujarat and it was...I mean, he’s basically vegetable dye on textile and it was sold on an online auction platform. I bought it sitting in a Washington, DC suburb and the payments were processed by Stripe, right. And so, this kind of integration has now made an artist who works on folk art in India so much richer because we have been able to connect with him and there’s massive gains from trade. Those are the sorts of things that make me incredibly optimistic about India. I think what is preventing India from reaching its full potential is basically, very poor regulation, bad government regulation. Government just needs to get out of the way and let Indians be entrepreneurial. And the second is just very poor health and education systems, which always...I think that really hampers people from reaching their full potential, right. How many wonderful artists and Einsteins and Mozarts and geniuses are hiding in India because they are not plugged into the global network, either because they couldn’t access education or they’re not healthy enough, or they’re not rich enough to afford a phone and an internet connection and so on, right. So I think those are the things, if India can manage to fix, I’m just very, very optimistic about its future, but most importantly, because of its numbers.

Tamara Winter: Hello, and welcome to the final episode of season one of Beneath the Surface. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. Over the course of six episodes, we’ve traveled the world from London to Lusaka, from the Salton Sea to Singapore and talked to infrastructure experts and visionaries who are all working to find creative solutions to some of the biggest problems facing their communities and the world. So it’s not surprising that, well, we have a lot more information than can fit into the episodes we made. So today I’m sitting down with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s the series producer for Beneath the Surface. You might remember him from episode two, when we visited his family’s plot of land near California’s Salton Sea. Together, we revisited each episode discussing some of the clips, characters, and stories that got left on the cutting room floor. We also got to talking about some of the big themes and episode ideas that we’ve been sitting on, ones that might make for an interesting season two, possibly a video spinoff? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, I hope you enjoy this look beneath the surface of Beneath the Surface. Everett Katigbak: Well, today we’re back in the studio talking about some of our highlights and lowlights and all the interesting things in between, our experiences in producing Beneath the Surface. Tammy just tracked the final episode, and now we’re just kind of reflecting on some of our learnings from it. Tamara Winter: I also wonder how many times we can say "beneath the surface" in this conversation, take a shot of oat milk every time. Everett Katigbak: So, Tammy, obviously we’ve kind of learned a lot through digging into these various topics, but maybe we can start at the top. The first episode was very kind of close to you, near and dear. And you have a lot of firsthand experience. What has happened in Zambia or what have we kind of just learned in Lusaka and in Nkwashi since we launched that first episode? Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly exciting about that episode, and I think for a lot of this series is that the stuff that we talked about is happening in real time. And that is very much the case with Nkwashi. So actually this week, as we speak and sit here in San Francisco, Mwiya and several other entrepreneurs are hosting the African Union and they are talking about just interesting ideas around trade and development and economic growth. And so I’m sad we couldn’t be there. But Nkwashi itself too, it’s amazing to see people move in. The residents of Nkwashi starting to kind of identify with the city and post about it. I think one of the things that was particularly interesting about that episode is that there’s a growth story within a growth story within a growth story. So we’re talking about a city in Zambia and then beyond that, we’re also talking about what it hopes to enable, which is like a really robust and flourishing technological ecosystem. So since that episode Nkwashi’s grown. There are, it seems like new interesting companies popping up, not just in Zambia, but across the continent, like every five minutes. So I’m optimistic. Everett Katigbak: It was really great kind of going from a place like Zambia and Nkwashi and then kind of bringing that somewhat closer to home. Obviously Salton Sea, was really kind of personal for me, but the most kind of exciting moment that I had there was actually spending time in Slab City and East Jesus and getting to meet a lot of the people that live off the grid there. And actually kind of realizing ultimately infrastructure is about supporting people. It’s the thing that kind of supports a lot of these different communities and lifestyles. Tamara Winter: More broadly, one thing I enjoyed about the Salton Sea episode, I think we could probably do a whole series on places that were, and then are now starting to come back. I mean, I don’t know that Salton Sea was ever on top necessarily, but it’s pretty striking that it went from being sort of the next Palm Springs to like an asthma machine. And so yeah, that could probably be its own series. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, it was interesting when, when we were there, I actually do recall quite a few like luxury cars, like Audis and BMWs driving around and exploring the area. And I can’t tell if they were just kind of extending their Palm Desert vacay or if they were genuinely looking at it from a developer’s perspective, because land can be had for pennies on the dollar there. But maybe there is kind of this thought that lithium is kind of permeating through the community and the people are starting to look at it as more of an investment. So it was really fascinating to see some of that going on. Tamara Winter: Yeah. And it just seemed like the conversation around Salton Sea is very much live. So I’m optimistic. I’m interested to see how GM kind of makes good on its commitment to have all electric vehicles by 2035. I’m interested to see what Tesla does there, what Ford does there. It’s going to be a place to watch, particularly if the Controlled Thermal Resources team can manage to make a breakthrough with the way that lithium is extracted. You’ll hear me say this a lot in this episode, I’m just very optimistic. Supply chains. Everett Katigbak: We talked a lot about, I think supply chains was probably the first episode that we really knew that we wanted to try and tackle this thing, not only because of how it’s been exacerbated by COVID, but also because I think the shipping container as a unit of measurement and as a metaphor and as an example for efficiency, actually gets kind of thrown around quite a bit in the industries and circles that we talk about. But just seeing you and Ryan Petersen interact was really fascinating. And seeing him kind of naturally dig into some of the storylines and the narratives that we talk about things like trade routes, historic trade routes, the Silk Road and how that was not only responsible for trading of goods, but also this kind of cultural transmission and how that shaped a lot of the people. You could almost see it as a cultural gradient throughout broader Asia and the Eastern Europe continent. So, that was really great. Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly interesting about this episode is that Ryan, it’s funny, he’s running one of the biggest companies in the world that’s focused on global trade. Despite the size of the company that Ryan is running, he had such a ground floor view of the acute challenges that the US, and kind of more specifically California, and even more specifically the port of Long Beach were facing. The thought to just like literally go out to the port and talk to some of the union workers and bring tacos. Everett Katigbak: Right. Tamara Winter: And literally just get people talking about what exactly was keeping people’s stuff so backed up was interesting. And it turns out that even though that was such a triumphant moment, when Ryan was able to help the city and really the state get that port up and running, there are still kind of persistent supply chain challenges. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. I remember, I think we had to rewrite some of the intros and some of the narrative bits to hear mainly because it was changing so rapidly. And I think when we first conceived the episode, things weren’t as congested in the ports. And then ultimately by the time we recorded, I remember going out to Malibu and seeing this long stretch of backed up cargo ships. And that was something I’d never seen. I’ve seen it in port towns, like maybe Singapore or Asia, but never on the California coast. So that was kind of mind blowing to actually visualize it. Housing, because a lot of it was Ben Southwood. I actually thought it was great seeing Ben Southwood in his natural element. When we were out there recently, I got to walk around with Ben and he’s just like a natural encyclopedic kind of tour guide, just hearing him point out very obscure, but also fascinating things about, "Look at this building. This brick pattern is because of this. And this is how it affects the building structurally." And going into ancient Rome and Londinium, and this was all within like a three block radius. So I really enjoyed kind of hearing him talk with the Haredi Jews, because they were able to kind of speak the same language, but also from very different perspectives, which was really fascinating. Tamara Winter: We knew we wanted to do something on housing, but the conversation around housing, why we don’t have enough of it, why it’s so expensive for me has gotten just extremely stale. And so it was really nice to see a very interesting community and maybe not necessarily the first one that you would think of being on the front lines of upzoning and really doing something about the astronomical rises in the cost of housing. So I really enjoyed personally, just learning about how Motty and Shmuel and the rest of the community were able to kind of solve their own problem. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, I guess that is one of the kind of things that changed even in the short time, since we launched this episode. I think we’re originally looking at it from a buyer’s perspective, looking at the markets, but then when you start looking abroad and realizing that even things like zoning, these are the things that are really impacting housing costs. And ultimately, what ties to the whole series together, I think it goes back to what a lot of things that Ryan Petersen was talking about, building materials and supply chains are also exacerbating housing inventory and things like that. One thing that I also started to see as a series unfolded was how all of these seemingly disparate topics were kind of connected through supply chain and infrastructure, ultimately. Tamara Winter: One thing I particularly appreciated about that episode was that I think sometimes with infrastructure, it can be such a big topic. It’s something that everybody needs, but it also has a ton of different stakeholders and the costs of infrastructure don’t necessarily always present themselves immediately. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, and it was really great to see. I mean, a topic like housing, there’s so many different vectors that can influence the ways that things like laws and zoning and ultimately building go. And this was a good example of them working with the municipalities local kind of government to retain the kind of historical sense of the area, but also kind of to address their cultural needs. Oh, transit was a great one. It was actually great to see kind of Tammy exploring her new surroundings out in New York City. In the episode she started off being a Dallas born and bred person, but moving to both places like San Francisco and New York that actually heavily rely on public transit. It was also really fascinating again, since we recorded and shipped this episode, there’s actually been some progress with bullet trains out in the Dallas and in the broader Texas area. So I’m wondering how that impacts you and your relationship with your kind of home base. Tamara Winter: Yeah. My sister texted me about that news. She loved the transit episode. So I’m from Dallas. My sister is in school in San Antonio right now. And so she was extremely excited about the bullet train. And I think people in Texas, I mean, that project has just made a ton of sense for a long time. So Texas I’m rooting for you. We started the housing episode talking about the fact that I had lived in San Francisco, DC and New York and kind of my experiences with renting in each of those cities. But the transit one is almost as striking, right? So each of those cities is very walkable, but the experience of taking transit and getting from point A to point B there is just very different. But I knew that I wanted to do an episode kind of as a thank you or a love letter or a like, thanks for welcoming me to New York. So it was really exciting to kind of explore the Upper East Side, to see the actual Second Avenue subway line in action. But it was just incredible listening to people talk about Japan and London and just other cities. I think what’s particularly striking about transit, even though it’s extremely difficult. It’s multifaceted. They’re all different agencies. There are like labor issues. There’s like what the public wants and will allow in their backyards. All of these things end up being impediments to transit. And yet some countries and cities still manage to get it done. Everett Katigbak: You know what, one thing that I observed, even in the kind of very few times that I’ve ridden Japanese trains, it is like quite a user-centric experience. I think it integrates very well into the landscape. It kind of connects this kind of futurist vision that people have of Tokyo and this kind of ancient historic version of Kyoto and the broader area. And it’s not a destructive process. Oftentimes we think of building trains, especially in the United States, it means that we have to tear down or retrofit something that’s historic, and it does change the landscape and make it look and feel different. But in Tokyo, these layers are able to exist in a way that I think is actually, I don’t know, it preserves their cultural history, but it also kind of projects Japan as this very futuristic and forward thinking place. Tamara Winter: Population. I mean, this is the episode that I was most excited about. This is the one I knew I wanted to make no matter if we made any other episode, because I don’t have any special love for buildings and trains and roads. It’s all useful insofar as it serves people. And so I think questions and population are just fascinating. I mean, years ago I got really interested in birthright trends in the first place and what governments were doing about it. And so you could probably sit for hours and just go down a non-stop list of downright comical things that governments are trying to do to address what they perceive to be the sort of big challenges of having an aging population. And so it’s everything from, we talk about Singapore in the episode. What we don’t talk about is like the time that some of their train stations had literal cartoon eggs on the floor, reminding women that they only had like a finite number of eggs, to Italy’s fertility day to the classic Australian campaign, 40 is the new 20, except if you want to have children. And so I was interested in moving beyond the kind of friendly cringe shaming of women and their sort of expanded choices about rearing families and to really kind of observe how people make decisions about fertility. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. It’s really interesting to see how Singapore kind of uses that lever or kind of turns that dial almost the way that we do here in the States with interest rates and things to kind of really stimulate or catalyze the economy because they’re kind of trying to envision 10, 20 years down the road, what the populace is going to do and how they’re going to impact all these things there. But ultimately, it does come down to like people and human capital as the main driver of economy because that’s why we do and make and build the things that we do is ultimately to kind of support and service people and human’s needs Tamara Winter: This episode, I was both very excited about, and that made me kind of uncomfortable because it turns human beings into kind of these fungible widgets that you can just kind of like turn on if you need more and turn off if you need fewer. It’s the one episode again, that I was kind of the most excited about going into it. And it’s also the one that I have the most questions, regrets. I don’t know what you would call that about. There are lots of things within population that are interesting. Decades ago, South Korea had a gender ratio that was like India’s. A lot more men than women due to a lot of like sex selective abortions and kind of social pressures to have more sons. And today their gender ratio is more like Canada’s. How does that happen? That’s a whole story in and of itself. And that right there may be the story of the series. That within every episode there was a thread that we barely got to pull. That could be an entire story in and of itself. It has been such a joy to work on this series, to sit down with climate scientists, population researchers, train nerds, housing analysts, and city builders, and to reflect on how all our lives are shaped by the infrastructure we build. If there were any questions that came up for you while you were listening to the series or just to this episode, let us know. The world of infrastructure is vast. And even though we’ve gone beneath the surface of six facets of it, I feel like in a lot of ways, we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. So get in touch with us. You can send an email to stripepress@stripe.com or you can tweet us at @StripePress or @_TamaraWinter. Well, you’ve heard me say it at the end of every episode, but Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. And since this is the last episode of season one, let me tell you a little bit more about Stripe Press. Our mission is to spread ideas for progress. So we publish books, produce movies, and yes, make podcasts all about people working for progress. One book that we recently released is Pieces of the Action by Vannevar Bush, which was originally published in 1970. For anyone who doesn’t know, he’s the guy who basically founded the National Science Foundation. This book is his account of working as the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II. He was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuse, the mass production of penicillin and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. You can find out more about Stripe Press, the books we publish, the movies we produce, and yes, even the other episodes of this podcast at press.stripe.com. The senior producers for season one up Beneath the Surface are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Original music for Beneath the Surface was composed by Auribus. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface.

Title: Stewart Brand – Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One
URL: https://press.stripe.com/maintenance-part-one
Time Published: 2026-01-20T19:01:30Z
Full Content:
The first in a multi-volume work, Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One offers a comprehensive overview of the civilizational importance of maintenance. The book explores the insights that can be gleaned from the maintenance of sailboats, vehicles, and weapons, with absorbing detours into the evolution of precision in manufacturing, the enduring importance of manuals, sustainment in the military, and the never-ending battle against corrosion. Maintenance: Of Everything is a wide-ranging and provocative call to expand what we mean by “maintenance.” It invites us to understand not only the profound impact maintenance has on our daily lives but also why taking responsibility for maintaining something—whether a motorcycle, a monument, or our planet—can be a radical act. Stewart Brand is the cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation. He created and edited the National Book Award-winning Whole Earth Catalog from 1968 to 1998. His books include The Media Lab (1987), How Buildings Learn (1994), The Clock of the Long Now (1999), and Whole Earth Discipline (2009). He was the subject of the documentary We Are As Gods (2020). Stewart Brand makes a persuasive case that keeping the human show on the road through well-planned maintenance is as vital and as fascinating a task as innovation and discovery themselves. A deliciously good book. Matt Ridley author of The Rational Optimist Once again, Stewart Brand reframes our worldview with a new perspective. You may not imagine you would be interested in rust, Soviet tanks, or tricked-out Model Ts—that is, until Brand reexamines them through the lens of maintenance. Maintenance: Of Everything is destined to be a classic. Danny Hillis cofounder of Applied Invention Stewart Brand is back with a manifesto on maintenance, the tool that empowers all tools. Preventative maintenance, deferred maintenance, and emergency maintenance: this much-needed, no-nonsense treatise illuminates the difference, and why it counts. George Dyson author of Darwin Among the Machines and Turing’s Cathedral Civilization is maintenance. No one else but Stewart Brand is talking about the art and science of maintenance and how to do it well. This will be an instant classic. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brand masterfully takes us on a journey through the world of the fixers keeping the gears of civilization rolling. If you’re the kind of person who wants to know why things break and how to stop it, you should read this book. Kyle Wiens CEO of iFixit What a splendid book to read while fixing an old house. I stopped moaning and whining and became a quiet hero of relentless “sustainment.” Bruce Sterling author and editor of Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology Maintenance is interesting in more ways than I can count. I felt smarter for having read this book and lucky for being alive at a time when Stewart Brand is writing it. Charles C. Mann author of 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus In his fresh and inimitable prose, Stewart Brand makes a striking case for what he calls maintenance–the upkeep of the things that make modern life possible. Back to the basics of caring and repairing–sailing boats, automobiles, sewing machines, Colt revolvers, bicycles and even tanks in the Yom Kippur war–Brand shows us why know-how and understanding how machines work really matter. New things get our attention but mastering how to take care of things we already have is life work that counts like no other. This book is Stewart Brand at his best. Jerry Brown former Governor of California A new classic — original and fresh, smart, wise, a universal topic, Stewart makes me so happy once again. Edward Tufte statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University Efficiency is the engine of civilization. But where do improvements in production efficiency come from? In The Origins of Efficiency, Brian Potter argues that improving production efficiency—finding ways to produce goods and services in less time, with less labor, using fewer resources—is the force behind some of the most consequential changes in human history. He examines the fundamental characteristics of a production process and how each can be made faster, cheaper, and more reliable, with detailed examples from a range of industries: steel and semiconductors, wind turbines and container shipping, Tesla and the Ford Model T, and more. The Origins of Efficiency is a comprehensive companion for anyone seeking to understand how we arrived at this age of material abundance—and how we can push efficiency improvements into domains like housing, medicine, and education, where much work is left to be done. Brian Potter is the author of the Construction Physics newsletter and a senior infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress. He previously managed an engineering team at Katerra, a SoftBank-backed construction startup, and has 15 years of experience as a structural engineer. Brilliant and comprehensive. Brian Potter is the single best writer in America on how important things get built, and his new book is the single best example of his work. Derek Thompson author of Hit Makers and coauthor of Abundance A whole-systems overview of all known manufacturing processes (past and present), crammed with dense details, stories, anecdotes, and lessons from the front lines… If you have any interest in, or responsibility for, how to make stuff at scale, you need to read this book. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brian Potter does impeccable, detailed research that he turns into clairvoyant insight about civilization’s most arcane processes. Here, he examines the mechanisms that enable spectacular efficiency in the production of goods and services. Stewart Brand cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation America has forgotten how to make things. Brian Potter is here to help us remember. By the time you finish this book, you’ll feel like you’re well on your way to becoming an expert in manufacturing. Noah Smith author of Noahpinion How did we build large language models? How do they think, if they think? What will the world look like if we have billions of AIs that are as smart as humans, or even smarter? In a series of in-depth interviews with leading AI researchers and company founders—including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, DeepMind cofounder Demis Hassabis, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, MIRI cofounder Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—Dwarkesh Patel provides the first comprehensive and contemporary portrait of the technology that is transforming our world. Drawn from his interviews on the Dwarkesh Podcast, these curated excerpts range from the technical details of how LLMs work to the possibility of an AI takeover or explosive economic growth. It also includes 170+ definitions and visualizations, classic essays on the theme, and previously unpublished interviews. The Scaling Era offers readers unprecedented insight into a transformative moment in AI’s development—and a vision of what comes next. Dwarkesh Patel is the host of Dwarkesh Podcast, where he produces deeply researched interviews with both obscure intellectuals and the most influential figures of our time. Gavin Leech is the cofounder of Arb Research, a consultancy that does empirical and conceptual work in various sciences. He has a PhD in AI. Dwarkesh has done a whole series of excellent video interviews with top AI researchers and engineers, and this book is a great distillation of those conversations to help people understand modern AI models, how they are built, where they are headed, and why they are important. Jeff Dean chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research There’s only one test relevant for an artifact about AI: Would you learn more from reading it than you would from using a newly released LLM for the equivalent amount of time? The Scaling Era handily passes. Patrick McKenzie author of Bits About Money and host of Complex Systems Dwarkesh’s interviews are full of quotes that will be in history books. Byrne Hobart investor, consultant, and author of The Diff and Boom From the Moon landing to the dawning of the atomic age, the decades prior to the 1970s were characterized by the routine invention of transformative technologies at breakneck speed. By comparison, ours is an age of stagnation; of slowing median wage growth, rising inequality, and decelerated scientific discovery. In Boom, Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber take an inductive approach to this problem. They track some of the most significant breakthroughs of the past 100 years—from the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program to Moore’s law and Bitcoin—and reverse-engineer how transformative progress arises from the same dynamics that govern financial bubbles, bringing together small groups with a unified vision, vast funding, and surprisingly poor accountability. Bubbles, they conclude, aren’t all bad—in fact, they create the ideal conditions for transformative innovation. Integrating insights from economics, philosophy, and history, Boom provides a blueprint for accelerating innovation and a path to unleash a new era of global prosperity. Byrne Hobart is an investor, consultant, and writer. He is the author of The Diff, a daily newsletter covering inflection points in finance and technology. He is also a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. Tobias Huber is a writer and investor. He is a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. He has a background in philosophy and holds a doctor of science degree from ETH Zurich. The dot-com bubble looked like the peak of delusion, but the truly deluded were those who wanted to indefinitely defer the future. Everyone knows bubbles can disguise madness as wisdom; read this book for the alternative history of our age. Peter Thiel investor and author of Zero to One Boom makes the case that humanity’s greatest risk is not climate change or misaligned superintelligent Al but not making enough progress. A must-read for those who seek to build the future. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz When is it that temporary bubbles can help drive forward progress? This happened with the railroads, with the internet, and it is likely to happen with AI. Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber have produced some essential reading on a very important and also understudied topic. Tyler Cowen author of The Great Stagnation and professor of economics at George Mason University “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up,” Charlie Munger advises in Poor Charlie’s Almanack. Originally published in 2005, this compilation of 11 talks by the legendary Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman has become a touchstone for a generation of investors and entrepreneurs. Delivered with Munger’s characteristic rhetorical flair, Poor Charlie’s Almanack draws on his encyclopedic knowledge of business, finance, history, philosophy, physics, and ethics to introduce the latticework of mental models that underpin his rational and rigorous approach to life, learning, and decision-making. It is an essential volume for any reader seeking to go to bed a little wiser than when they woke up. This abridged edition features a new foreword by Stripe cofounder and president John Collison. Charles T. Munger (1924–2023) was an investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He was the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett. He was chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 to 2011. He was also chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.Peter D. Kaufman is the chairman and CEO of Glenair, Inc. He was a longtime director of Wesco Financial Corporation and is a former director of Daily Journal Corporation. In 2005, he edited and published Poor Charlie’s Almanack, a compilation of talks given by his longtime friend Charlie Munger. This book is something of a publishing miracle—never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its internet site. Warren Buffett CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger was born before corporate speak, before business leaders minced words to obscure truths. But Charlie Munger’s words have always cut like a knife—and that sharp spirit of truth-seeking built Berkshire into what it is today. We should all aspire to such clarity. Katherine Boyle general partner at a16z Poor Charlie’s Almanack is a timeless classic that will change how you approach life. There is a billion-dollar education inside this book. Shane Parrish founder of Syrus Partners and Farnam Street This book is the best way to learn from Munger and his ideas. It’s a must-read for anyone interested in thinking clearly, rationally, and effectively. Ana Lorena Fabrega author, educator, and chief evangelist at Synthesis Charlie Munger’s insights are timeless. Some of these speeches were delivered over 20 years ago, but they feel like they could have been given yesterday. Tyler Hogge venture partner at Pelion If I could only read one book to help me succeed in life and business, this is the book I’d read. Charlie’s timeless wisdom has inspired millions and will continue to resonate for generations to come.

Jason Citron founder and CEO of Discord In Pieces of the Action, Vannevar Bush—engineer, inventor, educator, and public face of government-funded science—offers an inside account of one of the most innovative research and development ecosystems of the 20th century. As the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II, he was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuze, the mass production of penicillin, and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Pieces of the Action offers his hard-won lessons on how to operate and manage effectively within complex organizations, build bridges between people and disciplines, and drive ambitious, unprecedented programs to fruition. Originally published in 1970, this updated edition includes a foreword from Ben Reinhardt that contextualizes the lessons Pieces of the Action can offer to contemporary readers: that change depends both on heroic individuals and effective organizations; that a leader’s job is one of coordination; and that the path from idea to innovation is a long and winding one, inextricably bound to those involved—those enduring figures who have a piece of the action. Vannevar Bush (1890–1974) was an engineer, inventor, educator, and architect of public-sector funding for scientific research in the United States. During World War II, he oversaw a wide-ranging R&D program that paired government funding with scientific research, resulting in the development of radar and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Outside of government, he conducted foundational research in computer science, including the invention of the differential analyzer. His 1945 essay “As We May Think” is credited with anticipating aspects of personal computing and the internet, while his government report Science, The Endless Frontier laid the groundwork for the founding of the National Science Foundation. Both are considered seminal texts that have inspired successive generations of scientists and engineers. Pieces of the Action is not just about science and innovation, it’s about state capacity. Anyone who longs for renewed, effective institutions will find the wisdom of a kindred spirit reflecting on how to build them. Eli Dourado economist and senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University Pieces of the Action provides a window into the way Bush saw himself: as part of a larger cultural tradition, equipping new generations with knowledge from past ones. I came away encouraged and inspired by the knowledge that great things can be built in spite of stagnation, rigid norms, and conventions, through the determination and foresight of people who work to change institutions—and build new ones, too. Saloni Dattani cofounder and editor of Works in Progress and researcher at Our World in Data Scientific and technological progress depend crucially on leadership. Bush understood this better than anyone, and he had a front-row seat to the most important R&D work of the 20th century. This candid memoir gave me a better understanding of how research leadership works and why it’s desperately needed. Jason Crawford writer at The Roots of Progress It’s hard to deny that Vannevar Bush was at the nexus of an astounding number of people and events that shaped the modern world. In Pieces of the Action, he works hard to give us a window into his thought processes, and from them distill timeless lessons about leadership, research, institution building, and human nature. Ben Reinhardt CEO of PARPA, researcher at the Astera Institute, and host of the Idea Machines podcast Pieces of the Action catalogs the scientists and engineers who were pivotal to an Allied victory in World War II—and how the ad-hoc organizations born out of that crisis ultimately provided the blueprints for our modern scientific institutions. If you want to understand the ‘man in the arena’ at the center of it all, this discursive, blunt, and often funny memoir is the best place to start. Alec Stapp cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress Pieces of the Action is an often-whimsical ride through time and the mind of the man whose insight, strategic instincts, and institutional empire-building formed the basis of the modern scientific state. One comes away with a view of scientific development that is anything but linear: the gravitational weight of historical contingencies, idiosyncratic personnel, and key management decisions described in Pieces of the Action continue to profoundly impact us today. Caleb Watney cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress In Where Is My Flying Car?, engineer and futurist J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer the deceptively simple question posed in the book’s title. What starts as an exploration of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an examination of the global economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion and nanotechnology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. Hall then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress—one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. J. Storrs Hall, Ph.D., is an independent scientist and author. He was the founding chief scientist of Nanorex, Inc. and a president of the Foresight Institute and is currently a research fellow at the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing and an associate editor of the International Journal of Nanotechnology and Molecular Computation. He was also accredited as an expert reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the field of computational climate models. His previous books include Beyond AI: Creating the Conscience of the Machine and Nanofuture: What’s Next for Nanotechnology. Now residing on Chesapeake Bay, he dabbles in aerodynamics design under the auspices of Eastern Shore Flying Cars, LLC. There are many writers with optimistic visions of the future. However, the goals I most often hear are all the negation of negatives: cure cancer, eliminate poverty, stop climate change. . . . This is good, but it is not enough. [These techno-optimists] are content with bringing the whole world up to the current best standard of living, but not increasing it. In this context, I found Where Is My Flying Car? refreshing. Hall unabashedly calls for unlimited progress in every dimension. Jason Crawford founder and CEO of Roots of Progress One of the best and most interesting books on technology. Tyler Cowen professor of economics at George Mason University and cowriter of Marginal Revolution Whether there is ‘tech stagnation’ or a revolution about to swarm the skies, Where Is My Flying Car? offers piercing questions and answers about what it might take to make the dream come true. David Brin author of Existence and The Postman While Silicon Valley is synonymous with software, its beginnings were driven by a need for a better class of hardware. Michael S. Malone’s The Big Score is a panoramic history of Silicon Valley’s founding days—written as they were still playing out in 1985. One of the first reporters on the tech industry beat, Malone recounts the feverish efforts of technologists and entrepreneurs to build something that would change the world. Starting with the birth of the semiconductor in the 1930s, he illustrates how decades of technological innovation laid the foundation for the meteoric rise of the Valley in the 1970s. Malone punctuates this history with profiles of tech’s early builders, capturing the high-agency spirit that shaped the electronics revolution. A decades-long story with individual sacrifice and ingenuity at its core, The Big Score recounts the history of today’s most dynamic sector through its upstart beginnings. Michael S. Malone has covered Silicon Valley and tech for over 30 years. His articles and editorials have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Economist, Fortune, New York Times, and San Jose Mercury-News. He has written or co-authored more than 25 award-winning books, including Bill and Dave and The Intel Trinity, and coproduced The New Heroes, an Emmy-nominated miniseries on social entrepreneurs. He lives in Palo Alto, California. Mike Malone’s epic depiction of Silicon Valley was a calling card for me and countless other young entrepreneurs with a background in tech. Malone’s stories captured the essence of Valley culture and the many outsize personalities who helped create this mecca of tech. Years later, this book is still relevant, and offers insights into the Valley and its ongoing place in the world. Jeff Skoll first president of eBay Mike Malone is the gold standard for telling Silicon Valley’s history. He has witnessed the evolution of the Valley from fruit groves to office parks, and has catalogued the world’s dependency on the Valley’s innovative technology. Experience the growth of Silicon Valley through the eyes of a pioneer, friend, reporter, and mentor to so many of us early Valley entrepreneurs. Sandy Kurtzig founder, CEO, and chairman of ASK Group From the Valley’s deep roots in the semiconductor industry to the rise of startups and venture capital, and the emergence of new models of management, The Big Score documents the beginnings of a technological transformation. When the book was first published, the microprocessor was kick-starting the computer industry. Today, our greatest innovators continue to build on the work of these early pioneers. John Hennessy president emeritus of Stanford University and chairman, Alphabet Inc. So rich was the scientific harvest of the early 20th century that it transformed entire industries and economies. Max Planck laid the foundation for quantum physics, Barbara McClintock for modern genetics, Linus Pauling for chemistry—the list goes on. But in the 1970s, the nature and pace of scientific discovery began to stagnate due to a combination of peer review, mandated justification of spending, and the push for short-term miracles. In Scientific Freedom, first published in 2008, Donald W. Braben presents a framework to find and support transformative scientific innovation. Even in the earliest stages, groundbreaking research can look unrecognizable to those who are accustomed to the patterns established by the past. As Braben argues, support for this research requires rethinking the processes used to discover and sponsor scientists with revolutionary ideas—and then giving them the freedom to explore. Donald W. Braben is a scientist and author. From 1980 to 1990, he led British Petroleum’s Venture Research program, for which he developed a radical, low-cost approach to finding and funding researchers whose work might redefine their fields. He currently holds an honorary position at University College London. A superb book, both inspiring and provocative. Braben strives to ensure that the most creative scientists, if completely free to pursue unorthodox research, will aim to attain the ‘elixir of civilization.’ Dudley Herschbach Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1986 All scientists, granting agencies, and policymakers should read this refreshing book and respond to the need to change current funding paradigms. Sir Richard J. Roberts Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1993 Braben has long held visionary views of how to fund the most innovative and creative science. It cannot be denied that, with the right financial support, his approach can be made to work spectacularly. Sir Martyn Poliakoff University of Nottingham, Michael Faraday Prize 2019 A sobering (but hopeful!) exploration of the stagnation in what I would call ‘paradigm shifting research’ and what to do about it. Ben Reinhardt Braben does an excellent job of highlighting the need to reassess the selection criteria used to decide what scientific projects receive funding. Quarterly Review of Biology Over the last 20 years, open source software has undergone a significant shift—from providing an optimistic model for public collaboration to undergoing constant maintenance by the often unseen solo operators who write and publish the code that millions of users rely on every day. In Working in Public, Nadia Eghbal takes an inside look at modern open source software development, its evolution over the last two decades, and its ramifications for an internet reorienting itself around individual creators. By delineating the structure of open source projects, she explores, for the first time, the maintenance costs of production that software incurs for its developers. Drawing on hundreds of developer interviews and analyses of platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube, Eghbal argues that examining who produces things on the internet, and not just what they produce, helps us understand the value of online content today. Nadia Eghbal is a writer and researcher who explores how the internet enables individual creators. From 2015 to 2019, she worked independently and at GitHub to improve the open source developer experience. She is the author of “Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure,” published by the Ford Foundation. Nadia writes from a unique perspective at the intersection of open source, economics, and poetry. This is the definitive book on the dynamics of online creative communities. Nat Friedman CEO of GitHub Nadia is one of today’s most nuanced thinkers about the depth and potential of online communities. This book could not have come at a better time, as the ways we relate to each other have become more sharply mediated by the internet. Devon Zuegel former director of product for communities at GitHub In the age of information abundance, we’re all maintainers now. Working in Public is an anthropological dive into the stories of real developers, providing us a way to ask new questions through the lens of open source. Nadia presents us with a book that isn’t focused on just money, licenses, or code, but which is for all of us who make, as creators of all kinds. Henry Zhu maintainer of Babel Working in Public [is] a fascinating book . . . . We need to rethink the very idea of what crowdsourcing is capable of—and understand that it is perhaps more limited than promised. The open source revolution has been carried on the backs of some very weary people. Wired Eghbal clearly sees and articulates something important about the way we make things, and how that’s changing. . . .Working in Public opens by challenging a common perception about open source today: the idea that it’s collaborative. Alex Danco What inspires a great idea? Can we train our thinking to develop world-changing understandings and insights? Richard Hamming would say yes. In The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, he elaborates on his seminal essay “You and Your Research,” a provocative challenge to anyone who wants to build something great, and offers a manual of style for how to get there. Playfully framed as a textbook, and rich in its recounting of influential individuals like Albert Einstein and Grace Hopper, this unorthodox memoir by the seminal mathematician and engineer encourages the reader to aspire to, learn from, and surpass the achievements of yesterday’s greatest minds. This edition includes the original 1996 compilation of Hamming’s lectures for the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, along with a new foreword by designer and engineer Bret Victor and more than 70 redrawn graphs and charts. Richard W. Hamming (1915–1998) was a scientist and mathematician who discovered formulas that allow computers to correct their own errors. He provided crucial programming support to the Manhattan Project, and later joined Bell Labs. In 1968, he received the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science. Hamming is here to tell you about excellence. His lessons unfold through personal stories of discovery and failure—life as an extraordinary scientist. But Hamming demands that you do extraordinary work, too, and for that he offers the best advice I know. Andy Matuschak software engineer, designer, and researcher Hamming was always as much a teacher as a scientist, and, having spent a lifetime forming and confirming a theory of great people, he felt he could prepare the next generation for even greater greatness. That’s the premise and promise of this book. Bret Victor founder of Dynamicland Your last chance to read the thinking of one of the major intellects that the U.S.A. has produced. Eugene N. Miya NASA researcher [Hamming] was one of the last geniuses who believed in innovation as a shared public project. New Yorker, which named The Art of Doing Science and Engineering a best book of 2020 Before Prince of Persia was a bestselling video game franchise and a Disney movie, it was an Apple II computer game created and programmed by a lone developer, Jordan Mechner. Mechner’s candid and revealing journals from the time capture the journey from his parents’ basement to the forefront of the fast-growing 1980s video game industry, as a 20-year-old fresh out of college with a liberal arts degree—and the creative, technical, personal, and professional struggles that brought the Prince into the homes of millions of people worldwide. In The Making of Prince of Persia, on the 30th anniversary of the game’s release, Mechner looks back at the journals he kept from 1985 to 1993 and annotates them with insights into the game that established him as a pioneer of cinematic storytelling in the industry. Jordan Mechner is a game designer, screenwriter, and author. His other books include the sketchbook journal Year 2 in France and the Eisner Award-nominated graphic novel Templar, a New York Times bestseller illustrated by LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland. Prince of Persia was the first computer game I ever fell in love with. Mechner’s journey is a universal one for anyone creating something brand-new, and it brought me back to the early, crazy days of building Instagram. Mike Krieger cofounder of Instagram Mechner’s journals are a unique record from the birth of an industry. The Making of Prince of Persia is also an unvarnished window into the creative process, with all its excitement, toil, setbacks, doubts, and triumphs. A fantastic read. D.B. Weiss cocreator of HBO’s Game of Thrones Probably my favorite book on game development. Neil Druckmann writer and director of The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 It’s a genuinely delightful book, even if you don’t care about the history of video games. . . .To read Mechner’s contemporaneous logs of his wrestling with his tools and machines is to take a journey back to a heroic age of games authorship. Cory Doctorow The best biography I’ve ever read. Applied Divinity Studies Although communities feel magical, they don’t come together by magic. Whether starting a run crew, connecting with fans online, or sparking a movement of K-12 teachers, the secret to getting people together is to build your community with people, not for them. In Get Together, the founders of the community strategy agency People & Company—Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh, and Kai Elmer Sotto—provide a practical and heartfelt guide to create thriving communities, both in person and online. The authors break down into clear steps the challenges of getting passionate people together, help individuals and organizations navigate the intricacies of leading a community, and share true stories of everyday people who have created vibrant communities. Get Together shows that if we join forces—as company and customers, artist and fans, organizer and advocates—we’ll do more together than we ever could alone. Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh, and Kai Elmer Sotto founded People & Company, which helps organizations build communities. In 2021, People & Company was acquired by Substack. I highly recommend Get Together for anyone who’s looking to crack the code on building a community. Alisha Ramos founder of Girls’ Night In Get Together is a generous, practical, and heartfelt guide to creating community in the digital age. With no jargon and no nonsense, Bailey, Kevin, and Kai lay out simple steps for helping people come together in meaningful and powerful ways. Dave Isay founder of StoryCorps Get Together tells the stories and reveals the insights of community building. Don’t start one without reading this book. Robert Wang founder of Instant Pot While management is foundational to any organization, engineering management in particular presents its own set of challenges—especially in high-growth environments. How and when should your engineers pay down technical debt? How do you tackle a seemingly endless stream of migrations? How do you ensure that each engineer on your team is growing at the right pace? Will Larson’s An Elegant Puzzle explores the specific challenges of engineering management—from sizing teams to handling technical debt to developing succession planning—and provides a guide to solving complex managerial problems. Drawing on his experience at Digg, Uber, and Stripe, Larson presents a thoughtful approach to engineering management that balances structured principles with human-centric thinking. A useful primer for engineering leaders of all levels at companies of all sizes, An Elegant Puzzle lays out a road map for building organizations where engineers can thrive. Will Larson has been an engineering leader at technology companies including Yahoo, Digg, Uber, Stripe, and Calm. An Elegant Puzzle draws from writing on his blog, Irrational Exuberance. He is also the author of the book Staff Engineer. An Elegant Puzzle is a masterful study of the challenges and demands of the discipline of engineering management, viewed through the prism of systems thinking. Readers can expect an actionable template for addressing complex problems with finesse, creativity, and fairness. Cindy Sridharan distributed systems engineer and author of Distributed Systems Observability Software engineering is evolving faster than ever before. In An Elegant Puzzle, Will Larson captures the timeless spirit of creative problem-solving that draws us to software engineering, while also providing concrete strategies for modern organizations. Jeffrey Meyerson host of the Software Engineering Daily podcast Engineering managers can often feel like they are struggling to keep their heads above the water. Our technical training is missing the frameworks and tools needed to build healthy and productive teams. The insights and step-by-step approach covered in An Elegant Puzzle will become your favorite go-to resource. Oren Ellenbogen VP of engineering at Forter An Elegant Puzzle is to date the most hands-on perspective on engineering management within a high-growth, tech-first organization, that I have read. . . .[It] is not just for engineering managers: product managers and engineers working at high-growth companies will find it a good read. Gergely Orosz Larson captures the timeless spirit of creative problem-solving that draws us to software engineering while also providing concrete strategies for modern organizations. Software Engineering Daily When it comes to the flow of information, technology has categorically reversed the balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age—government, political parties, and the media. In The Revolt of the Public, Martin Gurri tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world. Originally published in 2014, The Revolt of the Public now appears in an updated edition, which includes an extensive analysis of Donald Trump’s improbable rise to the presidency and the electoral triumphs of Brexit. Gurri concludes with a look forward, considering whether the current elite class can bring about a reformation of the democratic process, and whether new organizing principles, adapted to a digital world, can arise out of the present political turbulence. Martin Gurri is a geopolitical analyst who specializes in the relationship between politics and global media. He spent 28 years analyzing open media at the CIA. The Revolt of the Public draws from writing on his blog, The Fifth Wave. All over the world, elite institutions, from governments to media to academia, are losing their authority and monopoly control of information to the broader public. This book has been my No. 1 handout to anyone seeking to understand this unfolding shift in power from hierarchies to networks in the age of the internet. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz Martin Gurri saw it coming. When, without fanfare, he self-published the first edition in June of 2014, he did not specifically name Donald Trump or Brexit. But he saw how the internet in general and social media in particular were transforming the political landscape. Arnold Kling economist and writer We are in an open war between publics with passionate and untutored interests and elites who believe they have the right to guide those publics. Gurri asks the essential question: Can liberal representative democracy survive the rise of the publics? Roger Berkowitz founder of the Hannah Arendt Center and professor of politics and human rights at Bard College “The internet has been a marvelous invention in lots of ways, but it has also unleashed a tsunami of misinformation and destabilized political systems across the globe. Martin Gurri . . . was way ahead of the curve on this problem. Vox Mr. Gurri writes that the internet has empowered ordinary citizens by giving them new information and tools, which they then use to discover the flaws in the systems and institutions that govern their lives. New York Times Throughout history, economic growth has alleviated human misery, improved human happiness and opportunity, expanded political rights, and lengthened human lives. If we want to prolong growth trends and the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for societies that come with them, every individual must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us. So how do we enable such altruism? In Stubborn Attachments—a culmination of 20 years of philosophical and economic thinking and research—Tyler Cowen argues that reason and common sense can help free us of the faulty ideas that hold us back as people and as a society, allowing us to set our sights on the long-term struggles that maximize sustainable economic growth while respecting human rights. At its heart, Stubborn Attachments makes the contemporary moral case for economic growth and delivers a dose of inspiration and optimism about the future. Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and director of the Mercatus Center. He was named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the past decade. He is the author of several books, including the New York Times bestseller The Great Stagnation, and is an opinion columnist at Bloomberg. He also cowrites the blog Marginal Revolution and hosts the podcast Conversations with Tyler. Most of Tyler’s books will change how you see the world in a myriad of small ways. Stubborn Attachments might well change the way you see the world in one very big way. Whether you agree or disagree with Tyler’s argument, I think you’ll find that following the logic in Stubborn Attachments is as fun as it is intellectually provocative. Cardiff Garcia cohost of the NPR podcast The Indicator from Planet Money Tyler Cowen is a national treasure, and Stubborn Attachments is brimming with deep insights–about the immense importance of economic growth, moral obligations, rights, and how to think about the future. It’s a book for right now, and a book for all times. A magnificent achievement. Cass R. Sunstein Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard and bestselling author of Nudge Tyler Cowen is one of the most intriguing and eclectic thinkers on the planet—like many people, I read something by him every day. In Stubborn Attachments, he combines economics and philosophy in a truly important achievement. His best, most ambitious, and most personal work. Tim Harford author of The Undercover Economist The thing about economic growth, Cowen tells us, is that it has the potential to advance just about everything that people value. . . .There is considerable evidence supporting the commonsense view that citizens of rich countries are happier than citizens of poor countries, and that, within rich countries, wealthier individuals are happier than poorer ones. New Yorker Stubborn Attachments is a philosophy book. . . .[Tyler] doesn’t try to set out an absolute, formalistic, fully internally consistent system of ethical principles—instead, he embraces an eclectic, often conflicting set of principles. This is refreshing, since rigid systems always prove fragile to intuitive counterexamples. Noah Smith Stubborn Attachments presents a compelling case for redefining our long-term priorities in favor of more sustained economic growth and a greater respect for human rights. Los Angeles Review of Books Behind every great revolution is a vision, and behind one of the greatest revolutions of our time—personal computing—is the vision of J. C. R. Licklider. He wasn’t an engineer and he didn’t start a company or write code; instead, he was a relentless visionary who saw great potential in the way individuals could interact with computers and software. At a time when computers were a short step removed from mechanical data processors, Licklider was an enthusiastic catalyst for the seminal research that ultimately led to the internet. In a simultaneously compelling personal narrative and comprehensive historical exposition, The Dream Machine by M. Mitchell Waldrop tells the story of the birth of the computing revolution through the life of a man who shifted our understanding of what computers were and could be. Originally published in 2001, the book now appears in a new edition, which includes the original texts of Licklider’s three most influential writings. M. Mitchell Waldrop earned a PhD in elementary particle physics and a master’s in journalism at the University of Wisconsin. He has been a writer and editor at Science and Nature. He is the author of Man-Made Minds (1987), a book about artificial intelligence, and Complexity (1992), about the new sciences of complexity. When people ask me about Xerox PARC, I always tell them about J. C. R. Licklider—‘Lick’—and how he started the great research funding for interactive computing and pervasive worldwide networks, which have resulted in most of the technology we use today. The top book I recommend to read about this large process, which stretched over 20 years, is The Dream Machine by Mitchell Waldrop. Alan Kay computer scientist A masterpiece! A mesmerizing but balanced and comprehensive look at the making of the information revolution—the people, the ideas, the tensions, and the hurdles. John Seely Brown former director of Xerox PARC A sprawling history of the ideas, individuals, and groups of people that got us from punch cards to personal computers . . . impressive . . . compelling. New York Times The Dream Machine works admirably as an exploration of the intellectual and political roots of the rise of modern computing. It’s an ambitious and worthwhile addition to the history of science. San Francisco Chronicle Global technology executive, serial entrepreneur, and angel investor Elad Gil has worked with high-growth tech companies like Airbnb, Twitter, Google, Stripe, and Square as they’ve scaled from small companies to global enterprises. Across all of these companies, Gil has identified a set of common patterns, and compiled them into a repeatable playbook in High Growth Handbook. In this definitive guide, he covers key topics for scaling startups from 10 or 20 employees to thousands, including the role of the CEO, board management, recruitment and management of executive teams, M&A, IPOs, and late-stage funding. Informed by interviews with some of the most dynamic leaders in Silicon Valley, including Reid Hoffman, Marc Andreessen, and Aaron Levie, High Growth Handbook presents a road map for navigating the most complex challenges that confront leaders and operators in high-growth startups. Elad Gil is an entrepreneur, operating executive, and investor or adviser to private companies such as Airbnb, Coinbase, Checkr, Gusto, Instacart, Opendoor, Pinterest, Square, Stripe, Wish, and others. He is co-founder and chairman at Color Genomics. High Growth Handbook draws from writing on his blog. Elad Gil is one of Silicon Valley’s seriously knowledgeable and battle-tested players.

Reid Hoffman cofounder of LinkedIn Elad jam-packs every useful lesson about building and scaling companies into a single, digestible book. Aaron Levie cofounder and CEO of Box Armed with observations gathered while scaling some of the most successful and important companies of Silicon Valley, Elad has no-nonsense, highly applicable advice for any operator transitioning a company from the proverbial garage to the next stage, and beyond. Max Levchin cofounder and CEO of Affirm, cofounder and former CTO of PayPal Many founders eventually face a moment in their company’s journey when they’ll need to scale the company and think much longer-term about success. Mr. Gil’s book walks founders through some of the steps and challenges they’ll face, such as the role of a board, mergers and acquisitions and more. Wall Street Journal “We are as gods and might as well get good at it,” wrote Stewart Brand in 1968, as the opening sentence to the now iconic Whole Earth Catalog. For decades, Brand has had an uncanny ability to push “ideas that seem at the edge of believability,” accelerating progress in culture, technology, environmentalism, and more. His approach to work and life influenced many technologists who have gone on to shape our modern world, including Steve Jobs. We Are As Gods, produced by Stripe Press, is the first feature film about Brand’s remarkable life. Marrying never-before-seen footage with contemporary interviews, the film chronicles his journey, from his early days with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters through the birth of the personal computing revolution, to his latest quest to reorient environmentalism. The original score was composed by experimental musician and artist Brian Eno, who’s collaborated with artists such as David Bowie, the Talking Heads, and U2. Along with Brand, Eno is a founding board member of the Long Now Foundation, whose mission is to foster long-term thinking and responsibility. He contributed 24 original tracks, in addition to some classics. Infrastructure is—finally—having its moment. From transit systems to supply chains, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and others are evaluating whether our civic infrastructure is up to the task of supporting a growing—and warming—globe. In each episode of Beneath the Surface, we explore some of the most complicated challenges facing our world, and talk to the people who are rolling up their sleeves to build solutions. The New Atlantis: Charter cities Each year, tens of millions of people migrate from rural areas to cities—mostly in emerging economies, where populations are growing faster than governments can create basic infrastructure. To address the challenges of urbanization without industrialization, development experts, economists, and policymakers have proposed solutions spanning from increased immigration to better family planning. In this episode, we ask: could charter cities—a model inspired by the successes of places like Singapore and Shenzhen—be a path to accelerating growth in emerging economies? Founder and managing partner, Pronomos Capital Founder and former executive director of the Charter Cities Institute Founder and co-managing partner of Thebe Investment Management PhD candidate at McGill University Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto, and author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Juan Du, Dean of the University of Toronto School of Architecture, discuss Du’s book, The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City—and the many myths that surround the city’s origin and development. Salton Sea: White Gold in the California Desert In 1905, an engineering accident created one of the largest lakes in the United States: the Salton Sea. Now, more than 100 years later, the lake is shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the US. But the area is also poised to become the largest lithium mine in the country—to be used by GM, Tesla, and Ford to manufacture their electric vehicles. Still, there’s an inherent tension between mining heavy metals—often a dirty, high-pollution process, for environmentally beneficial purposes. In this episode, we explore the future of energy production, how boom and bust cycles affect cities and communities, and the often overlooked environmental considerations that roil the development of green infrastructure. Author of Queen of the Salton Sea: Helen Burns and Me Journalist at VICE Research Professor at University of California, Riverside Founder of Saving the Salton Sea and director of the Salton Sea Film Festival Audrey Carleton, environmental journalist for VICE, discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea to catalyze the burgeoning electric vehicle industry, the parallels to the oil and gas industries, and what it all means for the area's residents. The Industrial Ballet: An Investigation into Global Supply Chains Thanks to the global supply chain crisis, millions of consumer goods, from computer chips to couches to cell phones are in high demand but short supply. It would be tempting to think that the pandemic is the main culprit for the backup of global trade flows—but COVID merely exposed existing fault lines in our infrastructure. The advent of just-in-time manufacturing and a relentless focus on short-term earnings have left companies with little inventory in case of emergencies, making our supply chains less resilient. Ryan Petersen—CEO of Flexport, which manages global trade and logistics for some of the largest companies in the world—has some thoughts about how we can fix that. You Say You Want to Build More Housing The price of housing in major cities has, over the past few decades, far outpaced the cost of construction. Average New York City metropolitan area house prices are up 706% since 1980 (or 376% more than US consumer prices, and 326% more than US wages). For San Francisco the rise is 932%. In Ireland, prices have risen by about 800% in that period, driven by increases in Dublin in particular. The immediate effects of the housing crunch are generally well-understood: productivity suffers when people aren’t able to live near the jobs they want. But there are other, less-explored effects of the crunch: an increase in obesity (as folks become more sedentary due to longer commutes and a lack of walkable suburbs), a decrease in birth rates (as housing is often the biggest expense for families, making it difficult to realize their ideal family size), climate change, and inequity. Still, there are reasons to be optimistic. Advocates of building more housing are gaining important victories all around the world—but it remains to be seen whether or not these victories will prove to be lasting. Head of the Urbanity Project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University Founder of YIMBY Action Associate Professor of Economics at Trinity College Dublin Community leaders in the North London Haredi community In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Ronan Lyons, Associate Professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin, discuss Ireland’s economic development, the current challenges facing would-be homeowners and renters in Dublin, and the time the biggest concern in the Irish housing market was too much supply. Growing Pains and Bullet Trains: The Art and Science of Moving People In 2016, the much-anticipated Second Avenue Subway line opened in Manhattan, New York. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project… ever—a rare new addition to one of the largest and the oldest subway systems in the world. By contrast, half a world away, Tokyo has a sprawling web of commuter trains—boasting the 50 busiest train stations in the world. Yet today, even the busiest lines in Tokyo only experience a yearly average delay of 20 seconds—and minimal incidents. How did Tokyo manage to avoid the friction common in the transit systems of other megacities? In this episode, we examine how officials in post WWII-Japan created one of the most efficient examples of scaled infrastructure in the modern world—and what cities around the world can learn from them. Author of Pedestrian Observations and the Transit Costs project Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Pioneer Valley Planning Commission, Springfield, Massachusetts Train journalist and writer of How to Enjoy Railroads From Train Schedules. In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Alex Forrest, transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts, discuss the history of transit in the US, the relationship between transit and housing prices, and the formative years Forrest spent in Japan—and how they’ve shaped his current work in Springfield. People and Ideas: Populations as Infrastructure Up to now, we’ve explored physical infrastructure: supply chains, housing, transportation, and more. But the ultimate resource for any country is its people. For most of human history, populations were fairly stable. Then, in the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution precipitated an exponential increase in population, which reached a peak in the mid-20th century. Today, however, the demographic outlook in many developed countries is the opposite: birth rates around the world have fallen below the replacement rate. In this episode, we explore the effects of declining birth rates and what, if anything, could be done to reverse them. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about population growth: what happens when governments try to influence it through policy? Assistant Professor of Quantitative Analysis, Samford University Economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and Fellow at NYU Law Author of Slow Boring and One Billion Americans Retired Teacher, English Language Institute of Singapore Retired Quantity Surveyor In this conversation, Shruti Rajagopalan, Head of India Policy Research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and host Tamara Winter discuss Shruti's research on how population growth can accelerate economic development, the unintended consequences of fertility policy, and why 1991 was a pivotal year for India.

Wooo! Finally we got lights. Tamara Winter: Lagos, Nigeria is one of the largest cities in the world. It’s home to over 14 million people and one of Africa’s main economic hubs. It’s the most populous city in the country with Africa’s largest GDP. However in Lagos, even basic services are unreliable. Archived audio: Everything comes to life when there’s light. When there’s no light you can literally feel handicapped. Tamara Winter: This isn’t a new problem in Lagos. An unstable power grid and political corruption make providing everyday utilities—like electricity—a struggle. In 2016, The Guardian reported on a neighborhood that went without power for five years because its residents refused to pay bribes. These kinds of challenges are not unique to Lagos or even to Nigeria. Across the developing world—from Jakarta to Kinshasa—cities are growing rapidly. New residents are pouring into cities that have neither the infrastructure nor the institutions to adequately serve them. In his 2005 book Planet of Slums urban theorist Mike Davis chronicled the rise of million-person cities in the developing world. He described the lives of the more than one billion people who live in the world’s slums. Booming populations of these fast-growing cities find themselves in harsh living conditions. Flooded streets. Poor ventilation. Little to no waste clearance. And few basic services. The absence of infrastructure makes life dangerous. Lack of access to sanitation and healthcare are directly responsible for high infant and maternal mortality. Communicable diseases—that have become a thing of the past elsewhere—run rampant. Despite these challenges, people across the developing world are seeking out the economic opportunities that cities provide. So, is there another way? Another avenue for people in search of a better life to access not only economic opportunities, but also stable governance and reliable institutions. In this episode, we’ll be looking at one possible solution: charter cities. Built—sometimes almost from scratch—in developing countries. These developments are outside-the-box infrastructure. Rather than reforming or building on existing cities they are new constructions often with their own economic regulations and laws. Privately backed. And focused on bringing economic growth to emerging economies. Supporters see them as a way to theoretically seed the ground for more stable institutions and improved governance. Hello and welcome to the first episode of Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. It’s not an accident that the first episode begins in Nigeria. That’s where I was born. My family moved to the United States when I was just two months old. But growing up in Texas I often wondered: what if instead of being raised in Dallas, I grew up in Lagos, like the majority of my family? That question is part of why I’ve always been so fascinated by questions about development and specifically, about Africa’s trajectory. It’s part of my story. I’m also no stranger to the world of new cities. I used to work at the Charter Cities Institute. We’ll actually hear from the institute’s founder Mark Lutter a little later in this episode. The Institute, based in Washington D.C. is a non-profit that’s working to build the ecosystem for charter cities by developing institutional frameworks that can guide their creation. Now, before we get into the nitty gritty, I want to be really clear about some of the words we’re using in this episode. You’ve already heard me say ‘new cities’ and ‘charter cities.’ There’s a pretty broad ecosystem of new city projects. So when we’re talking about the whole landscape, I’ll use the term ‘new cities’—charter cities are just one part of that world, the part most focused on leveraging the creation of new cities for global development. So, what are charter cities and where did the idea for them come from in the first place? If you spend any amount of time talking to folks about new cities there’s one name that will keep popping up. Person 1: Paul Romer Person 2: Paul Romer Person 3: Professor Paul Romer Tamara Winter: Paul. Romer. He’s not a household name, but he’s been one of the most influential economists in the world for the last 20 years. He’s a former Chief Economist at the World Bank and in 2018 he even won the Nobel Prize. Archived audio: Dear Professor Romer...the tools you have developed broaden the scope of economic analysis...I now ask you to receive your prizes from his Majesty the King. Tamara Winter: He’s a big deal—if you’re an economist. But that’s not why all these people mention his name. In 2009, he gave a TED Talk. Now this might not seem that exciting—an economist giving a 20 minute lecture about his new idea. In fact, if you watch the talk—it’s on YouTube—you might not walk away inspired to start a city of your own. Romer walks on stage his hair more salt than pepper and close-cropped, wearing blue jeans and a dark suit jacket over a button down shirt. He paces back and forth while he talks, a clicker in his right hand occasionally changing slides behind him. His voice is steady, not monotonous, but not an orator’s. The talk has been posted on YouTube for just over 12 years and has only a little more than 150,000 views. However, for many who saw this talk back in 2009, who were captivated by Romer’s ideas, it was an a-ha moment. Like when the Beatles first went on the Ed Sullivan show. Back in 1964 a generation of young music lovers saw four guys from Liverpool playing music on their TV and thought to themselves: maybe my friends and I can do that. Inspired by Romer’s talk, many entrepreneurs began wondering the same kind of thing—what if they could build charter cities too. So—Romer’s idea. Charter cities. New cosmopolitan growth centers that would promote economic development and connect developing countries to the rest of the global economy. Romer’s proposed cities would be more than special economic zones—areas with different economic regulations—they would also be special governance zones. Places where different laws would allow for faster economic growth thanks to better institutions. Romer imagined cities located in developing countries administered by the governments of developed countries. Now, more than 12 years after Romer’s talk, if you ask some of the people most involved with the movement what charter cities are, and what purposes they serve, you’ll get pretty different answers. Patri Friedman: I think of a charter city as a special jurisdiction that is a geographic area that has different laws and institutions from the rest of the country. And the amount of difference has to be more than a special economic zone which typically just has some tax breaks, tariff breaks, a small number of legal changes. Tamara Winter: That was Patri Friedman. He runs Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm which invests in new city projects. Their slogan: Better laws. Better lives. Oh, and if you caught that his last name is Friedman. Yeah, he’s the grandson of legendary economist Milton Friedman. He got his start in the world of new cities when he founded the Seasteading Institute. A non-profit that worked to establish autonomous communities on free-floating platforms stationed in international waters. Friedman’s interest in new cities came from his analysis of governance as a kind of product that should be subject to updates. Patri Friedman: Why do our cellphones get better every year and our governments maybe occasionally get better, maybe sometimes degrade and what I realized is that if you throw away all the morality and philosophy and say, “Okay this is an industry”, what characteristics does it have? Tamara Winter: Mark Lutter, the founder and executive director of the Charter Cities Institute has a slightly more technical definition of what constitutes a charter city. Mark Lutter: So a charter city is a new city development: a new city with better laws. Paul Romer, for example, was advocating that high-income countries such as Canada act as a guarantor in a low-income country such as Honduras. And the Charter Cities Institute moved away from this, I guess, this idea, this definition, arguing for a public-private partnership. Tamara Winter: Lutter founded the Charter Cities Institute just one year after finishing his PhD in economics. In his view, charter city developments, if and when successful, will have long term positive impacts beyond the cities themselves. Mark Lutter: Charter cities have primarily been focused on emerging markets, creating a space with new institutions. So this would be going to places like Nigeria, Zambia, Honduras and creating new city developments that allowed for people to be able to hire more easily to, resolve disputes more easily to pay taxes, to register a business, having a government that’s effective at providing public goods, and this would allow for sustained economic development over time. Tamara Winter: The Institute’s website lists some of the existing cities that they see as examples of this model—jurisdictions that improved their governance and, as a result, their economic output. Dubai. Singapore. Shenzhen. Hong Kong. These cities have all experienced astronomical growth in relatively short periods of time. The Charter Cities Institute’s website has a slideshow with before and after images of each city and information about their growth. The images that accompany these numbers are just as striking. Shenzhen in 1980 is a pastoral scene of green fields, rolling hills, and distant mountains—home to about 300,000 people. But by 2017, it is all sleek skyscrapers and glowing lights—a metropolis with a population to rival New York City. Oh, and the average yearly income increased over 10,000 percent, too. Browsing these figures. Listening to Friedman and Lutter. And hearing Romer’s optimism echoing from 2009, it’s easy to understand why so many people are so dedicated to promoting the idea of new cities. But what do these numbers really mean? Who are these cities being built by? And maybe more importantly, who are they being built for? I first met Mwiya Musokotwane on a trip to a remote island in Zambia. I was there as part of my work for the Charter Cities Institute. Mwiya’s a stoic, physically imposing guy, well over six feet tall. I’ve known him for a while now and he’s basically got two speeds: full suit and sweatsuit. He’s either in board rooms, meeting with elected officials, and giving presentations, or he’s at home being a doting dad, the kind who keeps a lot of pictures of his daughter in his pocket—and on his Instagram. He’s the co-managing partner, along with his father, of Thebe Investment Management and the founder of Nkwashi, a new charter city project in Zambia. Mwiya Musokotwane: Zambia, it’s kind of like the junction point between Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa, and like South Western Africa also. Lake Tanganyika which is the world’s second longest and second largest lake by volume is partly in Zambia. The source of the largest river in southern Africa is in Zambia so it’s at the confluence of these interesting things. Tamara Winter: Zambia’s natural resources, especially copper, made it a target for colonization. But Zambia had a distinctly different experience than its neighbors. Mwiya Musokotwane: You didn’t have very militarized colonial experience as was the case elsewhere in Kenya or in South Africa. So the British were very white glove here. I think part of that is Zambia was never really seen as a place where they were going to settle…it was seen as a resource country. Tamara Winter: The British occupied what they called “Northern Rhodesia” from the late 19th century all the way until 1964. After gaining freedom Zambia began to function as a democracy. However, within a decade of independence the country was under one-party rule. Mwiya Musokotwane: Seven years later became a single party socialist state, as was the fashion in Africa those days, and you know that was basically the beginning of a long and steady decline for the country. Tamara Winter: The economy was soon in crisis and actually contracted for decades. Mwiya Musokotwane: We ended up losing three to four times our GDP per capita over the 20 years of socialism that we experienced. And then people basically got to a point where they had enough and demanded liberal democracy again. Tamara Winter: After a series of coup attempts… Archived audio: Where the rebel officers had attempted to announce they had attempted to overthrow the government because it was corrupt. Tamara Winter: …and internal struggles in the 90s, that saw former leaders imprisoned… Archived audio Kenneth Kaunda: Today, God is great indeed. I am out, but I’ve not been told why I was in the prison for five months and seven days. Tamara Winter: Zambia has once again begun the move towards a multi-party democracy. Just last fall, Hakainde Hichilema, who ran for president six times in the last 15 years, was finally elected. As recently as 2017, he too spent time in prison, accused of treason for his role in anti-corruption protests against the former president. Now, Hichilema is committed to an ambitious agenda and has already begun traveling, connecting with other world leaders… Archived audio Kamala Harris: Well it is my honor and pleasure to welcome you, Mr. President, to the White House. Tamara Winter: …working to ensure that democracy in Zambia will be bolstered by strong national institutions and a renewed commitment to economic development. Archived audio Hakainde Hichilema: For us to be able to run our countries in a manner that would deliver what we may call democratic dividends. Kamala Harris: That’s right. Hakainde Hichilema: Delivering accelerated economic growth development to offer opportunities to our people. I think, Vice President, that’s what will sustain democracy. That’s what will make democracy attractive. Tamara Winter: Hichilema grew up in a farming family and spent years in international business. His presidency promises a new era for Zambia, one focused on economic growth and greater stability in the government. Mwiya, who was born in the late 80s, grew up watching Zambia’s economic and governance struggles first hand. Now in his early 30s he wants his investment firm to be an engine of development not just for Zambia, but for all of Africa. This vision drives Mwiya’s interest in Nkwashi. You can hear the same far-reaching desire when he explains why he wanted to build a city in the first place. Mwiya Musokotwane: I was asking myself, “how can I apply this to fix these problems as opposed to being a bystander?” I started thinking about the resources I had available to me. It just so happened that my family owned a ranch about a half-hour drive out of Lusaka and it was large enough that something meaningful could be done there. Tamara Winter: Mwiya mentioned Lusaka. That’s the capital city of Zambia and the largest city in the country with between two and three million residents. It’s a bit larger than Chicago and slightly smaller than Berlin. And the problems he’s talking about? Well, the city is growing fast—faster than many of its institutions can cope with. As recently as October of last year there were major blackouts across Zambia. Power isn’t the only element of infrastructure under strain in Lusaka. It’s estimated that by 2030, the city will have a shortage of three million homes. Part of Mwiya’s drive to build a new city nearby was to add another living and working hub: one that could be a home to professionals and those who want to connect more directly with the rest of the world. Mwiya Musokotwane: Nkwashi is a satellite town to Lusaka. We like to call it a knowledge city. We’re anchoring the city on institutions of learning and it’s been designed to be able to be a home to up to 100,000 people. Tamara Winter: Those learning institutions include a 130 acre university campus and the Explorer School which provides entirely online education for primary and secondary school. Archived audio: Imagine a school without borders. A school where students and teachers come from places all around the world from Bahrain to France, from Australia to Zambia. Tamara Winter: In Zambia it is common for the children of wealthier families to be educated outside of the country, in Johannesburg or even London, where Mwiya went to school. The Explorer School also reaches across borders with students in Nigeria, India and beyond but is anchored in Nkwashi. By creating learning institutions in Zambia that are internationally connected, Mwiya hopes there will be even more reason for those seeking economic and educational advancement to stay. Mwiya Musokotwane: We’re creating these institutions that hopefully can be the engines of initial economic growth. If Explorer School and Explorer Academy are fantastically successful that then creates the natural impetus to create city number two and three and four and five. Tamara Winter: Large scale new city projects like Nkwashi sit squarely at the intersection of public and private institutions. They are often so significant in scope that they require cooperation from local and national governments, in addition to willing investors. Luckily, Mwiya was prepared to navigate both of those worlds from an early age, whether or not he was fully aware of it. Mwiya Musokotwane: I didn’t really grow up with a very boxed-in view of the world. Tamara Winter: His parents made sure of that. His father is actually one of the architects of Zambia’s financial system. Mwiya Musokotwane: He’s like a super disciplined academic type person and he’s also been a central banker and economist and policy maker. A lot of the conversations he would have would be around things to do with how to develop Zambia. How to develop Africa at large. Tamara Winter: His mother was an entrepreneur. Mwiya Musokotwane: She had her own ways of conveying similar values to us. But most of hers were more practical so I think everything I learned about business as an example, I learned from her. Tamara Winter: Growing up in a household with international business interests meant an early window into the wider world. Mwiya Musokotwane: I would go with my parents on their trips to figure out different commercial undertakings they might want to get involved in like acquiring land and stuff like that at a super young age. It created this very like, explorer type mindset in me. I think that’s stuck with me into adulthood. Tamara Winter: But Mwiya was also an introverted kid who preferred his own company. Luckily at home he was in an environment that filled him with a fierce curiosity. His parents nurtured his development—each in their own way. For example, when he was 13 his father gave him a biography of Albert Einstein. His mother? Well, she gave him The Power of Positive Thinking. Mwiya Musokotwane: You know, where my dad is taciturn, she’s more expressive. Where his interests lie in more technical facts hers are much more to do with human wellbeing. He’s taught me how to build systems and she’s taught me how to lead those systems. Tamara Winter: And now, with a project like Nkwashi, Mwiya is combining lessons from both parents. Mwiya Musokotwane: Building cities and building institutions of learning...it sits right smack on the intersection between public sector and private sector work. Tamara Winter: These projects also take a hefty dose of confidence and that ‘explorer mindset’ that Mwiya described. Like Patri Friedman and Mark Lutter, Mwiya’s interest in new cities came from his dissatisfaction with the status-quo solutions he saw being offered to the structural problems in Zambia. Without Mwiya’s imagination, the land that is now becoming Nkwashi could have been put to more mundane use. Mwiya Musokotwane: There was the possibility of just subdividing allotments and then selling those, but that also felt very boring and like, low-impact. And the possibility of building something more meaningful seemed more interesting. So we’re like, “Okay we’re going to build a city.” Tamara Winter: In the red dirt and scrub brush, Mwiya saw something possibly transformational that could reach far beyond 3,000 acres outside of Lusaka. Mwiya Musokotwane: Right now what we have is a situation where Africans regardless of where they live in the world are treated as nominal equals. It’s one thing to be equal in the law, it’s another to be equal in the way someone regards you in their hearts. And I think that’s what places like Nkwashi represent for me. Tamara Winter: Mwyia’s clear sense of purpose in building Nkwashi is not always as easy to detect in the world of new cities. Nor is the seamless mix of public and private. That intersection can sometimes be an uncomfortable one. Remember, when Paul Romer proposed the notion of charter cities, he was clear: they would be special opportunity zones run by other governments. That idea met with almost instant backlash. Isabelle Simpson: The argument is that Paul Romer’s model was too neocolonial because he would have these foreign countries come and intervene, but that when it’s private entrepreneurs because they are not bound to a particular country that it’s not neocolonial. Tamara Winter: Isabelle Simpson is a PhD candidate at McGill University studying new cities and startup societies. Isabelle Simpson: But obviously from the perspective of the local people it is very much neocolonialism. Tamara Winter: Discomfort over foreign governments running cities in other countries is part of what spurred changes in how new cities are discussed and planned. Patri Friedman of Pronomos Capital—who we heard from earlier—is especially interested in thinking of new models for charter city development. Patri Friedman: That idea that a charter city is operated by a foreign power that just didn’t fly at all. So today’s charter cities are overseen by the host country and often are public private partnerships with companies that will build and operate the city. Tamara Winter: But this model presents challenges of its own. Patri Friedman: The gold standard right now is the Honduran ZEDE system. Tamara Winter: In Honduras, laws were passed to seed the ground for new city developments. Archived audio: Honduras has began to create two of the twelve regions of development and employment also known as charter cities. Tamara Winter: Called the ZEDE laws, they were so controversial they created a constitutional crisis, and inspired multiple protest movements. Local suspicion towards new city projects has been common in Honduras. One project, Prospera, has had ongoing tensions with the population that lives near its borders. Prospera has also been criticized for its legal system. A board of seven arbiters, many of them not native to Honduras, oversee private disputes in the city. They are asked to make rulings over residents who may or may not speak English and who are governed by a code that has borrowed liberally from different existing sets of laws. That’s a pretty extreme example. Mark Lutter, the director of the Charter Cities Institute, who you heard from at the beginning of the podcast, has been critical of this particular aspect of Prospera. Champions of new cities do, however, speak glowingly about the possibilities of these kinds of mix-and-match legal systems, ones that allow laws to be switched out and updated like software. From Patri Friedman. Patri Friedman: What’s interesting to me from an infrastructure perspective is that modifying other kinds of infrastructure—power systems or sewer systems of a city—is very, very difficult but law is a virtual layer so it can be modified the same way you deploy new software builds. Tamara Winter: And the sources for these new software builds? They can come from almost anywhere. Patri Friedman: It’s a really, really interesting point of leverage to say can we essentially write better operating systems or copy the existing operating systems, that is, copy functional sets of laws and administrative procedures from countries that work well and bring them to other countries. Tamara Winter: To critics of the new city movement this description of governance sounds too straightforward. It is emblematic of the tendency of charter city advocates to oversimplify complex issues. Isabelle Simpson goes all the way back to the first moments of Paul Romer’s original TED talk as an example. Isabelle Simpson: He begins this talk by showing an Associated Press photo of African students who are sitting under streetlights at an airport and they’re sort of bent over their textbooks. Archived audio Paul Romer: Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. Isabelle Simpson: So already I find this sort of annoying because people have this really bad habit when they want to illustrate dysfunction or chaos they use Africa. Archived audio Paul Romer: These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don’t have any electricity at home. Isabelle Simpson: And Romer does not mention that the students are from the Republic of Guinea and the airport is the international airport there. And the year is 2007. Archived audio Paul Romer: Let’s just pick one, for example the one in the green shirt. Isabelle Simpson: Romer then gives one of the students a fictive name, “We’re going to name him Nelson.” Archived audio Paul Romer: Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: I bet Nelson has a cellphone. Archived audio Paul Romer: I’ll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here’s the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology like the cell phone, but doesn’t have access to a 100 year old technology for generating electric light in the home? Now in a word the answer is rules. Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that’s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: Actually the causes of electricity blackouts here are complex and a comprehensive explanation would have required Romer to address in addition to the poor tariff structures—what he says are the ‘bad rules’—he would have had to talk about the country’s weak infrastructure, issues of transmission and distribution losses, supply shortages and lack of diversity in the electricity generation mix, corruption distorting contract negotiation, and the neocolonial economic situation that thrives on extraction by foreign companies which are the ones grabbing the most electricity at the lowest price. All these complex elements, they don’t fit into Romer’s narrative about bad rules. Tamara Winter: The reason scholars like Simpson fear this simplification is because simple-sounding problems invite simple solutions that overlook necessary complexities. Isabelle Simpson: If you say that you want to build a new city what is it exactly that you mean by city? Isn’t a city a political space where people with different opinions and different ambitions will come and debate and sort of try to create this better society all the time? Or are you trying to create this community of like-minded people which ultimately is just sort of a gated community? Tamara Winter: In addition to political questions about new cities, there are also cultural and historical ones. Juan Du is the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. She’s also… Juan Du: …the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto. Tamara Winter: In her book, she pushes back on the popular narrative about Shenzhen: that until 1979 it was a sparsely populated backwater. And after government investment and its designation as a special economic zone only then did its population and economic output explode. Juan Du: I think it’s important to keep in mind what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top-down policy, it was a bottom-up willingness that people wanted to go there. Tamara Winter: In her book, Du unpacks how Shenzhen’s history allowed it to rapidly transform into the megacity it is today. Juan Du: The centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. The incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen was built up on foundations that was already preexisting and those foundations took decades if not millennium to be built. Tamara Winter: Du also takes issue with many of the popular statistics about Shenzhen pre-1979 that feed the city-built-from-scratch narrative. Juan Du: People think that in 1979 it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that have 30,000, especially a sleepy one and a small one at that. Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. Tamara Winter: The population of that 2,000 village conglomerate? Closer to 300,000. And it was this preexisting network that ushered contemporary Shenzhen into being. Juan Du: There are so much local and indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first ten years. Tamara Winter: The willingness in the new city world to downplay this part of Shenzhen’s story in favor of a more a-historical, top-down narrative worries Du. Juan Du: City making is a very, very complex and difficult process. The misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch that it was a blank slate or a tabula rasa is, I think, the most dangerous misconception. That one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. Tamara Winter: But looking at some proposed new city projects it seems like that’s exactly what certain investors hope to do. In 2020, Hong Kong real estate developer Ivan Ko proposed a creatively named new city “Nextpolis” to be located in Ireland and populated by residents of Hong Kong who wanted to escape that city’s increasingly challenging political environment. There was also a proposal in Singapore for a floating city that could house migrant workers and move, when needed, to be near construction projects. These simple-sounding solutions point to other important questions that need to be addressed in the new city ecosystem. Like who has a say in governance. Simpson points out that many of the cities cited as examples of new city developments—Shenzhen, Dubai, Singapore—are also those with restrictive, even authoritarian, national governments. Isabelle Simpson: It’s very bizarre that charter cities entrepreneurs would use this very authoritarian model as their blueprint for this sort of pro-free market, pro-freedom, individual freedom developments that they’re trying to do. Tamara Winter: One of the most high profile new city projects currently under construction— Saudi Arabia’s NEOM—fits this mold. Archived audio: The contemporary city needs a full redesign. What if we removed cars? What if we got rid of streets? What if we innovated in the public space? Tamara Winter: Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars of government money, this ambitious plan includes everything from automated ports, to city modules spread out over hundreds of miles of desert and connected by high-speed rail. Promotional materials make it sound almost irresistible. As one Wall Street Journal article put it: it’s Disneyland meets Dubai. Archived audio: Through advanced manufacturing methods we will create green industries of the future with sustainability and reusability built into their DNA. Because any business destined to change the world, must also protect it. Tamara Winter: NEOM is part of Saudi Vision 2030, the flagship project of the authoritarian Saudi government of Muhammed bin Salman. It has ruthlessly targeted journalists, activists, and critics at home and abroad. Isabelle Simpson: Entrepreneurs who are very insistent on freedom of association, freedom of movement, freedom of speech. Their model for charter cities are authoritarian countries. Tamara Winter: Nkwashi, however, is not this kind of project. It’s being built in Zambia by someone with deep roots in the country. And it is being supported by a new administration that is committed to using economic development to build more democratic institutions. Some form of government support is crucial in creating a new city. The projects that succeed will have both government support and a significant connection to the place where they are being built. Nkwashi has that connection. Even the name of the city speaks to its Zambian roots. Mwiya Musokotwane: It means eagle and so the Zambian national bird is the fish eagle and so we decided to name the city after the national bird and we chose to name it in a language that was indigenous to the area. Tamara Winter: However, these close ties don’t mean the city and the ideas that come along with it will be instantly adopted. Mwiya Musokotwane: I think people think of us as being fairly forward-thinking and maybe a little bit crazy sometimes, but I think in a good way. Tamara Winter: Some might view Nkwashi as ‘crazy’ but that hasn’t really harmed its popularity. Mwiya Musokotwane: And you know we sold out in like three months; that initial batch of I think 80 five-acre plots, it was. Tamara Winter: And Mwiya firmly believes in the mission behind Nkwashi—not just the city, but what it could represent. Mwiya Musokotwane: I see Nkwashi as a beta, as a proof of concept. Speaking as an African, I think one of the challenges Africa has had is we haven’t yet done really big interesting things as a continent—the kind of things where people look at them and say, “Oh wow that’s like super cool that has a lot of positive impact not just for Africa but for the world at large.” Tamara Winter: That drive to change perception is a personal one for Mwiya, shaped by experiences he had during his university years in London. At 17, he left Zambia, hopeful and a bit apprehensive. Tamara Winter: He made friends quickly and found community in the classroom. However, while in London he also experienced everyday racism. This might not sound that revelatory—a young African man encountering racism in early 2000s London. What makes these experiences so important is the way Mwiya talks about them. Mwiya Musokotwane: Running in the train station to catch the train and then policemen in the train station stop you like, “Where are you running to?” I’m in a train station, it’s obvious I’m going to catch a train. You know, it’s interactions like that where I felt like I was nominally equal. Tamara Winter: Did you catch that? Nominally equal. Mwiya uses the same words talking about these incidents as he does when describing the necessity of Nkwashi. If Nkwashi is proof of concept and other similar new cities can be built around Africa, Mwiya hopes that—in time—through the educational and institutional development they bring, the international perception of Africa and Africans can change. In the end, there are as many questions about the future of new cities now as there were twelve years ago when Romer gave his talk. Maybe even more since there are real projects being launched. I was once a die-hard evangelist for new cities, a true believer. I still see the promise in the model, but now I approach the subject with more humility. Basically I’m trying to remember how little I know about what the next decades of new city development will entail. The world of new cities is shifting all the time. There have been some major changes just in the last few weeks. Remember the ZEDE laws in Honduras? They don’t even exist any more! They were unanimously repealed by Honduras’ national congress. I’m still optimistic that some version of new cities will fit into the fabric of solutions to economic challenges. But I also recognize that, in 30 years, the actual model or models that succeed may look very different from many of the projects that have been proposed so far. In the meantime, knowing there are people like Mwiya out there, thoughtful enough to meaningfully consider the big questions facing their societies and daring enough to work on audacious solutions, gives me a lot of hope.

Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the first episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Juan Du. She is the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto and the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. In our conversation she offers insights into Shenzhen’s history, explains the personal connection to the city that inspired her to spend 15 years writing a book about it, and reveals why she thinks the ‘Shenzhen Experiment,’ as she calls it, is far from over. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dean Juan Du. Tamara Winter: So we’ll start with the hardest question first. Tell me your name, your academic affiliations, and why I’m talking to you right now. Juan Du: The why I’m not sure if I can tell you! So, hello, my name is Juan Du, I am the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto in Canada. And I recently relocated in the last six months from Hong Kong to Toronto. So it’s nice to be speaking with you. Tamara Winter: And tell me, so you’re an architect by trade. I would love if you could tell me a little bit about your background. How did you end up writing this book? Because, well you know certainly Shenzhen’s architecture is mentioned, that isn’t really the defining feature of the book. And maybe you could tell folks what the name of your book is as well. Juan Du: Sure. So the book is called The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City and the book as it was published is probably the fifth evolution of it or reincarnation of it. I didn’t start out by writing such a book because I am trained in architecture. And I started out to write a more architectural book about the city and specifically about the urban villages of the city. However, as I started to uncover more and more about the urban villages, I discovered a larger story really at the story of the city and the story of China. It is a story that I think is very misunderstood. It essentially is the story of China in the last 40 years and how that is contextualized within a broader understanding of the history of China, perhaps over a few centuries. So it just became a much bigger book, perhaps not in length, but in scope, the more I researched and worked on that. One of the first reasons why I wanted to write the book is actually based in my first hand experience of planning and design projects in Shenzhen. And I came across this deep history and vibrant, overlooked, urban neighborhoods that is not present in the way that Shenzhen is typically portrayed in either national media in China and especially international media in the world. It’s usually portrayed as the city without history, the city without any important pre-urbanization culture or people of significance. And that was just very much contrary to what my own experiences and later my own research uncovered. So this is why I decided to take on this challenge of writing this book. And it was very difficult for me, precisely because I wasn’t trained particularly to write such an expansive book, but it was very much a learning journey. And with these knowledge and lessons that I’ve uncovered over a decade of research and writing, I think it does contribute back to my own discipline of architecture and urban planning and design, but also I hope it contributes to others who are interested in economics, politics, geography, environmental transformation, whether it is in the Chinese context or anywhere else in the world. Tamara Winter: For anyone who isn’t familiar, what is Shenzhen? Where is it? And maybe you can answer this now, or I can ask it again in just a little bit, why is Shenzhen such a significant city? Juan Du: Sure. I’ll start with the ‘where’ first, maybe. So Shenzhen is located in southern China. It’s at the southern east most tip of China, just north of a river from Hong Kong. And the river is called the Shenzhen River. And this river is the border between the city of Shenzhen and the city of Hong Kong. And it used to also be an international border that you know defined between China and colonial era Hong Kong, which was ruled by the British. So it is a very interesting location. I would also say that what’s a unique geographical feature, in addition to where it’s located, is the people via one fact: it is the only city in China’s southern region where the primary dialogue is not Cantonese, which is the southern dialogue of China. The primary dialogue in Shenzhen is Mandarin, which is a typically northern dialogue that people have used to speak everywhere in China. So this is not to say that Shenzhen is a northern city, but it really testifies to the cosmopolitan nature of the city, that it is located in the southern tip. And it has a very rich southern history of China, but it is a city of migrants from all across China. And it’s really, I would say the most diverse city in China in terms of the backgrounds of people and where they’re from geographically and perhaps also socioeconomically. And I think that for me, is what makes it a significant city. And I would say that it also makes Shenzhen the most dynamic city in China today because of that mixture, because of that diversity. And it has this extreme mixture of low tech and high tech industries, it has this extreme mixture of urban and rural cultures. It has this extreme mixture of kind of the very local regional quality of a southern city with international enterprises and international headquarters via where it is and its unique history. It’s also significant if we want to speak about numbers, it’s also significant in terms of its population number. It is a city of 20 million people, which makes it a rare mega city in the world, 20 million. But what makes it more unique is that in the 1970s, the population in Shenzhen was 300,000. So it went from 300,000 to 10 million in two decades. And then when it was 10 million in the early 2000s, everyone said, “Well, this is it. This must be it. I mean, Shenzhen has reached this potential. It’s no longer unique. It’s no longer special.” Yet, over the following decade and two decades, it continued to grow into where it is today, a city, 20 million people. And that makes it an internationally significant city because that type of population growth, not only is it unprecedented in China, it’s unprecedented in the world, anywhere, at any moment of history, in the world. Tamara Winter: I really appreciate that because you just flagged Shenzhen’s population in the '70s. I’m going to come back and ask you a question about that because when I was working at the Charter Cities Institute, I was under the impression that the population was actually 30,000, but there’s a very particular reason why you used the 300,000 number. Juan Du: Yeah. Tamara Winter: But there were a lot of people who speak as though Shenzhen’s history began in 1979. Why was 1979 such a significant year for China more broadly? Juan Du: Right. So 1979 is a very significant year for both Shenzhen and China. In 1979 was the year, the city of Shenzhen was established, meaning it was formally designated as an urban unit. So prior to 1979, the region was called Bao’an county, which was a rural county in the province of Guangdong. So in 1979, it was designated on this special entity as a city of Shenzhen, but the further significance of 1979 to both Shenzhen and China is because 1979 was the year China, via the central government in Beijing, launched China’s reform and opening. It was basically the beginning of a series of economic and sociopolitical reforms that entirely pivoted China’s economy and culture onto the world stage and into the identity of what China is today, internationally. I think for anyone who perhaps do not have that particular memory or anyone who’s younger than 50, I would imagine that they would be very shocked if they’re shown images or facts about what China was like in the 1960s and '70s, including anyone who’s younger than 50 in China today. The year 1979 to launch, it was a very pivotal moment and pivotal year. It’s not to say everything was instant.1979 launched the reform and opening. 1979 established the city of Shenzhen, but the first decade of that was very rocky. It was very difficult. It was very challenging. Shenzhen was very close to being shut down multiple times, reform opening policies was close to shut down multiple times. It wasn’t until the mid 1990s, right, almost two decades after 1979, did it stabilize and the country and the city had enough confidence that this is definitely the right direction for the city and for the country. Tamara Winter: And for anybody who doesn’t already know, how did allowing Shenzhen, designating it as a special economic zone, change the city? I mean, you’ve alluded now to population growth. I’m also curious about GDP growth and more broadly how Shenzhen’s success really impacted the whole country. Juan Du: In 1979, what was initiated was not only the city of Shenzhen, there also was initiated a policy to create special economic zones. And in 1979, Shenzhen was one of four special economic zones that was created. So what makes Shenzhen’s beginning as a city unique is that within that year, it was both a city and a special economic zone in China. There are many conversations about special economic zones. It continued to be used almost like a miracle growth formula in the world today, especially in developing economies and cities, what it meant for China at that time for Shenzhen, at that time by special economic zone, it simply meant within the designated special economic zone of Shenzhen, which was only actually the southern half of the city of Shenzhen. But within that special economic zone that the zone and the city government had the power to create an experiment with various policies and various mechanisms that was not legal, that was not allowed and not existent outside of the zone. And I also think sociopolitical reforms and policies that were experimented with, that at the time was not possible anywhere else in China. For example, at that time, if you were not born in a particular city and had its local residency status, which is called Hukou in China, you cannot legally work in anywhere but that city. You cannot get a job, you cannot get housing, you cannot get married anywhere else, but that city. It was very much mechanism of economic and population management system in China, let’s say, that it was a planned economy. But because Shenzhen was designated as a special economic zone, in Shenzhen if you were a migrant from somewhere else, from another city, from a rural region, from a village, you could get a job. You could go to school, you could rent a home, you could get married, you could make so many decisions about your own life that at the time in China, you couldn’t. And that’s why it was significant. And I would say, that’s what attracted people to go there. So what makes it unique, it’s not only the number and the population growth. I think the question is that why did all these people go there? That’s one of the biggest, I think overlooked lessons. Shenzhen as is being discussed either as a charter city precedent or model, or as a special economic zone model. I think it’s important to keep in mind, is that what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top down policy. It was a bottom up willingness that people wanted to go there. People were not forced to go there. People were not sent to go there. People left the comfort of their home. People left the comfort of their jobs and their families to go to, at the time, I said the first decade was very difficult for Shenzhen, but people left the comfort of their home. And under a planned economy, if you had a job, you had that job for life. It may not be a job you love, but you had it. You had housing, you had a job, you had your basic social networks. Within those first decade, the type of people that the city attracted were a very unique type of people. It was people who was more adventurous, it was people who is entrepreneurial. It was people who are not satisfied with what life offered them in wherever they were. So what makes Shenzhen a really interesting case study for me is a much more closer understanding of what propels people, what would attract someone to whichever place or whichever socioeconomic costs are coming from. What would attract someone to leave everything they know, and go to this place and believe that it is a land and opportunity. And to the testament of Shenzhen, even though there has been, of course, many people who arrived in Shenzhen and couldn’t make it and left, but many more did stay, right? The fact that it started with the population 300,000, now it’s 20 million. We’re basically talking about 20 million migrants, 20 million people, because it’s only within four decades, right? New population growth. Those were born in Shenzhen is still not the majority of the 20 million. The majority of the 20 million are migrants from everywhere else. They went to Shenzhen and they were able to, despite whatever challenges of a new environment, changing policy, they were able to take root and take advantage of the various unique opportunities that the city have offered and was able to make their homes there. Tamara Winter: You went to Shenzhen, I believe in 2005, I love that the book kind of starts and ends in the same place. Forgive me if I say this wrong, in Baishizhou, what did you see when you first got to Shenzhen and why is that specific village so significant to you? Juan Du: I did use Baishizhou, a particular urban village, as a historical site and device to open the book and end the book. And there are personal reasons. And I think for me also intellectual reasons to want to do that. Personal reasons is that in 2005, I was working in Beijing at the time and I was flying to Shenzhen to work. And I would fly to Shenzhen once every week or every two weeks. I’d fly in in the morning and I’d leave in the last flight out, because why would I want to stay in Shenzhen, it’s a city with no history, no culture. I’m only going there on business. And then one day my meeting ran over, the city official, the urban planner that I became very good friends with decades later was driving a bit too slow, going to the airport. And I missed my flight. So the city put me up in a hotel. It was a place called Overseas Chinese Town, O-C-T, which is the nicest neighborhood in Shenzhen. It has these kind of Italian villas. It has a very famous theme park. It has these tree-lined streets and some business hotels. So I was put there to stay for the night and take my first flight out the next morning. And in the hotel room, I couldn’t sleep. So I thought maybe a walk would do it. So I started walking and got lost and walked into this incredible scene, this was probably past midnight already, of a city square with everyone full of people at midnight, full of people, cooking and eating and this outdoor market, lots of kids running around. And I described it as seeing, I think in my book rather cinematically, but it was a very cinematic experience. It was as if I discovered this new world that no one had told me about, none of the architects and planners and government officials I had met at that time in Shenzhen, because I was just starting to understand the city has ever mentioned such a place of urban villages. None of what I’ve read about the city have talked about it. So it was just this incredible thing. And then later I was to understand that Baishizhou is the city’s largest and most populous urban village. It has this incredible history that I speak about in the book, I think in one of the chapters. And I did decide to end, I believe it was the last chapter on Baishizhou as well to, in some ways to talk about what started out as a very touristic understanding of what the urban village is and what the city is. But after a decade and a half of researching and interacting and learning from the local residents and the local scholars, I start to really have a much deeper understanding. However, by, at the end of the 15 years, Baishizhou was in the process of being cleared out for demolition. So I really wanted to be able to include that part in the book to really put in some ways a sense of urgency to what I wanted to call out to attention of both the people in Shenzhen, people in China, people everywhere else is that very often what’s happening through an urbanization process of so-called urban renewal, what we are demolishing, which on the surface might cosmetically look as if it shouldn’t be there, that in fact is the very heart and engine of what made that city vibrant and important in the first place. And that, for me, I think has a certain degree of urgency and has a degree of importance to be able to share with an international audience. Tamara Winter: Your book does, I think a masterful job of pointing out many misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen, whether it’s that Shenzhen’s success should primarily be attributed to top down government, to the idea that Shenzhen before the city kind of grew to become what we know it to be today, had no one there and it was just kind of this like back woods village and the land was pretty insignificant. So I’m wondering if you could tell me what are maybe some of the sort of most jarring misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen and why was it so important to you to kind of take pains to correct them? Juan Du: The reason why it’s important for me to put that front and center is because I had those very same misperceptions and misconceptions of the city when I started first going there. But what’s different between myself and perhaps the greater media perhaps is that my misconceptions are very quickly dispelled by me understanding the city more, but then is to watch that those misconceptions, not only did it stay throughout the decade and half I was researching and writing the book, they actually grew, it grew in their status. And it grew in the number of people who held them, it was primarily at first just kind of a national discussion. And then it became an international, Shenzhen became an international model city. And with Shenzhen’s reputation rising in the last decade, the misconceptions also arose in their importance and impact. So I thought it was really important to outline that and to say that this is why I’m writing the book, is I wanted people to have an understanding that not only is Shenzhen not the way that is commonly being perceived. In fact, it is the exact opposite. That’s what I think is really intriguing and unfortunate to me about these misconceptions of Shenzhen, and there’s many. But I think for the purpose for the book and for the purpose of me trying to create it more succinctly and communicate them, I had outlined that there was misconceptions of time, misconceptions of people, misconceptions of purpose. So misconceptions of time, we spoke about the fact that Shenzhen was established as a city in 1979. And for the most part, we’ve been speaking about the city’s growth in the past four decades and how that paralleled or instigates, actually, the growth of China in terms of economics in the past four decades. However, if you have read my book, you understand that in the book, I take pains to research and create evidence to show that the centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. And that if we did not understand what had happened in Shenzhen in the region in China prior to 1979, there could be no understanding of why Shenzhen was created. Why there was this special economic zone. Why China launched the reform opening. And most importantly, I think I wanted to evidence and I hope it was compelling to anyone who has read the book that the incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen in the past four decades absolutely was built up on foundations that was already preexistent in the region. And those foundations took decades, if not millennium, to be built. And that if Shenzhen was what people think it was in 1979, and this is where the misconception at place is also one of the misconception is that people think that in 1979, it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that has 30,000, especially a sleepy one and small one at that. But Shenzhen was not a small sleeping fishing village. Even if we don’t look at the population statistics, Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. And this is really important to understand the region and this particular place, the people, the geography, the fact that it was a port, the fact that it had these rivers, the fact that it had all of this land, that was cultivated. So that geographic understanding is really important because the misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch, that it was a blank slate or tabula rasa is I think the most dangerous misconception that one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. So I think that really is the biggest and most dangerous misconception of Shenzhen because that’s not how it happened. And the reason why I say it’s the most dangerous misconception is that Shenzhen now has been used as a model city in the context of charter cities, in the context of new cities, in the context of special economic zones, to demonstrate that not only is it possible to grow a city from blank, to plan a city from nothing. And all you had to do is add foreign direct investment. Not only is it not that, it’s the opposite of that. There was so much local indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first 10 years. And this is really something that I’m very passionate about to advocate because I believe in the importance of cities, I even believe in charter cities as something that’s important to talk about, I believe that we can make new cities and make it livable and attractive, but we also need to understand that it’s not just add money or just add policy, there is no miracle growth in this way that it is city making. It’s a very, very complex and difficult process. And if my study of Shenzhen hopefully can evidence is that it’s really important to understand that preexisting geography of people, history, culture of that place and that we should see those existing geographies, not as something to get rid of, not as a inconvenience, not as a nuisance, but really see them as the key ingredient, the seeds, if you will, that can contribute to the success of the future new city or the future new charter city. Tamara Winter: I think a lesser understood part of Shenzhen’s kind of contribution to the world, its cultural contributions. There’s a music video that you reference. This is around the time that you’re starting to get the first music videos coming out of China and these music videos are being shot literally as the city is being constructed. And one thing you’ve taken quite a lot of care to sort of show, not tell people about, and whether it’s in your book or in your appearances since then, is the real spirit of the people in Shenzhen. Juan Du: Yeah. So, I think in the book, I say one evidence, the first master plan of Shenzhen was based on a anticipation of a population 1 million by 2010. And by all accounts, that was a very ambitious master plan. There are not many cities that was able to go from scratch to 1 million. It was already a very ambitious plan, top down planning, many cities who’s been planned to have city of 1 million do not have any, right. There are many ghost towns, whether in China or elsewhere, more top down planned cities fail than succeed. So the top down planning from policy, from resources, infrastructure, housing, central funding, what have you, anticipated population of 1 million by 2010. The actual population in 2010 in Shenzhen was 10 million, 10 times more than what was planned via policy and the various instruments of that, whether economic or spatial. So 90% was unanticipated bottom up, right? 90% was just, people wanted to go there. And this is where the importance of the urban village I was speaking about earlier because the city was planned with its infrastructure, whether it’s housing, schools, hospitals, restaurants, to serve a particular proportion of the population. Who made up for the 90%? The local communities, the local villages, they turned their own houses into rental housing. And then once they had rental housing, the new migrants opened up restaurants. So what’s interesting of Baishizhou is that you can walk into any street in Baishizhou, and you can, within one hour, sample food from all over China, because they’re all opened by migrants from all over China. So this is what I mean by that I think we have underestimated the powers of bottom up action and bottom up growth. And because the book is intended for a general intellectual audience, I do not put too much academic or theoretical terms in there, but that aligns with my own work, in understanding informal urbanization, informal settlements, and to understand how communities build their own housing, build their own economy, build their own social network and social systems. And I’ve come to really understand that for a city to be a healthy, vibrant, expanding city, you need both formal or top down policy and planning and governance. It’s not just, that’s not important. It’s very important without that 10%, right? Without that top down, there would’ve been no Shenzhen. But this other part, the informal growth, the informal settlements, kind of these informal networks that very much is tied into and contributed to that formal economy, that formal policy, you need that without the informal on the bottom up, there would be no Shenzhen as we understand it today, and we would not be speaking about it and I would not have written a book and it would not be cited in India and Africa, Honduras, Ireland, wherever it is around the world as a model city, right? Because that top down aspect, that kind of planning aspect is actually quite standard, but it’s this kind of how these policies, when emerged with the local population of the preexisting villages and were emerged with all of these people from all around the country, coming into this one city and all collectively believing in the possibility of the new. That is an incredible, I think, a social, psychological experiment. So, I go back to why I called my book The Shenzhen Experiment is because I think that it is very much an experimental city. It was set up as an experiment for China to experiment with, can you have market economy in a communist country? But I think its significance goes way beyond that. It’s an experimental city in understanding human nature. It’s an experimental city in understanding both the incredible opportunities of urbanization and rapid growth, but also the native impacts on the environment on the geography of rapid urbanization. You know, the fact that it’s the state of where it is today, of being say a mega city of between 10 million to 20 million people, it’s only in the last two decades. That makes it one of the world’s youngest cities and newest experiments. I think in the conclusion of my book, I said, “I think the Shenzhen experiment’s far from over.” So I am always very uncomfortable, even myself to make any very declarative or conclusive comments about Shenzhen, because I think we don’t really understand it yet. Despite the fact that I’ve spent these time researching into it and reading everything I can about Shenzhen and southern China, I think there’s still so many more we don’t know about the city. There’s so much more lessons to uncover. So I think this experiment continues and where the city is today and where it’s going to go, it’s an open question. It’s an absolute open question. So for me, is that there’s so much for us to learn about this city and for the knowledge and experience of the city to benefit both cities and governance and also individuals in China, in Asia, but also I think there’s a lot of lessons to offer to people from all around the world, whether they’re decision makers or they’re citizens themselves. In the book, I do highlight a number of individuals I have met. Some of them are historical figures, and some of them are common everyday people and how their own lives were impacted by the urbanization of the city. But also I wanted to show how they, as individuals contributed to the city and ultimately shaped the city. And one thing I always like to remind myself and remind everyone else, that 20 million sounds like a monolith block. It’s very common for when, especially in the American context, when we look at Chinese cities or when we look at China, we see these huge gigantic numbers and that just automatically turns apart your brain into thinking that is monolith. But I do want to highlight that it’s 20 million of individuals and it’s 20 million individuals not unlike you and I. It’s 20 million individuals who have their strengths and weaknesses, who have their own neuroses, who have their emotional baggage. And these individuals, whether they’re mayors or they’re construction workers, they have had and continue to have influences in shaping the city and that’s whether it’s in Shenzhen or elsewhere. And that ultimately is something that I really would like for, especially the English reading audience and especially the North American audience, to have a more humanistic understanding of Shenzhen, to have a more humanistic understanding of China, to have a more humanistic understanding of cities that in one country or in one city, there are so many diverse views and so many different diverse entities and that individuals, nationalities, places of residence should not be grouped in within one overarching understanding about one particular country. Imagine if that be the case in the reverse, right. Do we, as individuals, want to be defined by the overall message that came out of the U.S in the past five years? I would think not. So in the same way, I would also ask everyone to have the curiosity, to try to understand whether it’s China or India or Africa or France, to understand the nuances of these political situations, and to understand the difference between national politics and individual rights and individual dreams.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: Earlier this year I visited California’s Salton Sea for the first time. I went with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s a producer on this podcast, and you’ll hear from him throughout this episode. It was his first trip back in over 20 years. Everett Katigbak: It just surprised me how little has changed. But also seeing the lake itself was kind of surprising. When I was standing there the other day, it’s a no man’s land. It’s literally scenes out of Mad Max. I know we say that kind of jokingly, but you can really envision it. Tamara Winter: Since the waters of the Colorado River rushed into the Salton Basin in 1905, the lake they created has been a source of promise and conflict. Now it’s shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the country. It’s also poised to become one of the largest sources of lithium in the United States. As the world transitions from gas to electric vehicles, demand for lithium is increasing rapidly. And so is interest in the Salton Sea. The potential for investment and industry could be transformational for the area. But what will that transformation look like? What impact will lithium extraction have on local communities? And what can examining the history of the Salton Sea reveal about its present and future? Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter. In the first episode of Beneath the Surface we looked at charter cities. New urban developments built almost from scratch through financial investment and political will. In this episode we’re visiting a very different kind of place. Everett Katigbak: So we’re here in Salton City. This is, I think the largest community out here around the Salton Sea. Tamara Winter: The communities that have grown near the Salton Sea are unincorporated. And include everything from off-the-grid artist communities to half-inhabited suburban developments. The fate of these communities is tied to the sea. When it was a tourist destination they felt the benefits. But that opportunity has long since dried up, along with the sea. Now, the promise of becoming a ‘lithium valley’ is bringing a wave of development that could breathe new life into the area. I mentioned my colleague Everett. Well, when we started talking about doing an episode on the history and future of Salton Sea, we found out that Everett and his family have a stake in the area. At the tail end of the Salton Sea’s resort era, his family bought some land there. Hoping, like many, that it was an up-and-coming oasis. Everett Katigbak: This is the place where when I was young my parents actually bought a plot of land. We’re literally standing on this plot of land. Around it there’s a handful of homes, but for the most part it’s a bunch of empty lots out here. It is a very picturesque view. It’s like a postcard. But I imagine the closer you get to it the less photogenic it gets. Tamara Winter: You have a daughter Drew. How do you hope she experiences the Salton Sea? Do you think in her lifetime it might get, I don’t know, poppin’? Everett Katigbak: I don’t know…I don’t imagine she’ll have any connection to it. I never talked about it growing up. It’s just something I totally forgot about. The more my parents are getting older and thinking they need to let go of this place the more I’m hearing about the lithium stuff. So for me it’s something that I kind of want to hold onto for a little longer and see if something happens. Tamara Winter: In the early 20th century, major construction projects were underway across southern California. Engineers planned irrigation canal networks to bring water to arid corners of the California desert. The dream at the time was to provide water for farming to the scorching hot Imperial Valley where temperatures regularly spike well above 100 degrees. Rain rarely falls. And snow has been recorded only once in the last century. But nature had other plans. For millennia, the Colorado River had occasionally made its way into the Salton Basin, creating lakes. But in the spring and summer of 1905 multiple floods wore down and eventually broke through the canal gates. And water poured into the basin. Initial attempts to close off the flow of water failed miserably. Another flood in November swept away the hastily constructed dams of gravel and brush. For two years the water flowed. And for two years crews worked around the clock. In sweltering temperatures. Under the threat of multi million-gallon flash floods. To redirect the river. When the water was finally stopped, the newly formed Salton Sea covered over 400 square miles. The early years of the Sea were mostly quiet. Naturalists categorized the many species of birds that began to congregate on its shores. The Salton Sea Wildlife Refuge was created. During the Second World War the sea became a source for fish when German u-boats made the ocean too dangerous. The military used the sea for bombing exercises. In fact, the crew that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima flew practice missions over the Salton Sea. The sea, however, was already shrinking and becoming saltier and saltier. But this didn’t stop interest in the sea from growing during the postwar economic boom. One of the people who moved to the Salton Sea after World War II was Helen Burns. She and her family made their home on a small plot of land owned by her father. Her daughter Donna Kennedy—who was barely more than a toddler at the time—remembers those early years well. Donna Kennedy: She moved us down to the Salton Sea into a trailer which had an adjacent outhouse. And we had a standpipe where we could stand and bathe. It didn’t make any difference that we were nude because no one else was there, it was completely deserted, just us. Tamara Winter: Living in the semi-wild meant Donna and her sister had a unique childhood. Donna Kennedy: We did a lot of swimming in the sea, it was very clean then. Sandy beach and very lovely. So my sister and I would just frolic in the water and the sagebrush and try to catch lizards and avoid snakes and scorpions too, we didn’t care for scorpions. Tamara Winter: Helen, however, had big dreams. She set up a makeshift stand built out of a piano box and some palm fronds. Truck drivers. Immigrants trekking up from Mexico. Occasional tourists. They all stopped by Helen’s for soda, coffee, postcards, or tubes of Salton Sea sand. Business grew. And so did the number of tourists. The Salton Sea became a destination, marketed as an inland resort—the next Palm Springs. By the 1950s the Salton Sea was the place to be. And Helen expanded to meet the demand. Donna Kennedy: Basically if you wanted to have some fun you went to Helen’s. At her high point she had a marina, a boat dock, gas tanks. A campground. Besides the bar and restaurant, the motel, but I’d say by 1958 things were really moving. On 4th of July she had hell divers and people water skied across the sea and back and got trophies and wore little horns. On New Years she had icebreakers and people skied across and back. There was the Miss Salton Sea Contest, the Mr. Salton Sea Contest. There were treasure trails where people went across the desert in their dune buggies and they’d try to find all the treasures she had hidden…it was just roaring with activity. Tamara Winter: Helen even earned a new title: Queen of the Salton Sea.Helen wasn’t the only one who saw the promise of the sea in the 50s and 60s. Other entrepreneurs, sensing opportunity, hitched their fortunes to the sea. The newly formed Salton City grew and grew. Promotional videos from the time show a desert oasis, a paradise of crystalline waters and inviting beaches. The future for Salton Sea couldn’t have looked brighter. Archived audio: In an article appearing in the The Los Angeles Times April 17th, 1966, Salton City was chosen by a group of planners, architects, administrative officers, politicians, professors, and associated thinkers as one of the 24 major cities in southern California in the year 2000. Tamara Winter: By the late 1960s and early 1970s however, tourism was drying up. And so was the sea. The water level dropped so significantly and the salt level rose so much, environmental observers worried that the fish and birds that lived in and around the sea would begin to die. The lack of rainfall in the Imperial Valley meant that the sea’s main source of new water was agricultural runoff. Which brought with it pesticides. Soon birds began dying and algae bloomed in the once clear waters. Resorts closed or scraped by with reduced clientele. When powerful tropical storms ripped through the Imperial Valley in the mid-70s many packed up for good. Archived audio: Whacko: It used to be a real nice dinner house owned by Bill and Maxine McClaren. Huell Howser: What happened to it? Whacko: Eh, the floods. Huell Howser: Uh huh. Whacko: They kinda split up, well, actually it’s the floods what did it. Tamara Winter: By 2000, Salton City was far from being one of southern California’s major cities as the LA Times had predicted. In fact, its population shrank to less than 1,000. Most people who have heard of the Salton Sea are probably familiar with this era of its life - from the 70s to the present. In the popular imagination, it has existed for almost 50 years as a polluted, decaying, steadily salinating space populated either by die-hards left over from its boom years, or those looking for off-the-grid living in the surrounding desert. Less than an hour south of the sea, the unincorporated community of Slab City grew on the remains of a defunct military base. Artists, dropouts, and others seeking a life outside of mainstream society congregated in the desert in what is now affectionately referred to as “The Last Free Place in America.” When we visited Salton Sea, Everett made a trip out to The Slab and talked to some of the colorful residents. Wizard: Greetings and welcome to East Jesus! I am your mediocre half-assed tour guide. I don’t give tours. Tamara Winter: That’s Wizard. Wizard: I spend six months here and six months in India or Vietnam. Tamara Winter: If you meet him, his name makes a lot of sense. He’s got this long dusty gray beard that he’s clearly been growing for several decades and he speaks with the confidence of someone who could conjure a rabbit out of a hat. Wizard: This is a sheltered workshop for the work ethic impaired. They’re not lazy. They’re work ethic impaired. Tamara Winter: East Jesus is a massive collaborative art piece. Wizard: It’s a work of over 2,000 artists. And they would come here and they’d be inspired by the art. They would create art. Tamara Winter: It’s about 50 miles from where Everett’s family has their plot of land in Salton City. On the other side of the sea. But the environmental disaster at the sea touches both communities. As the sea evaporates in the baking desert sun, dust rises from the exposed lakebed. Wizard: The wind blows all this toxicity towards San Diego and LA and Imperial County doesn’t have the money to do anything but San Diego and LA does. If it affects them, they’ll do something about it. Archived audio: Sort of fine white powdery dust sits on top of the playa…and a very small wind will blow that and…I’ve been out here at times when it looked like a snow blizzard, you couldn’t see anything. Tamara Winter: Faced with looming environmental and human crises, the state of California has created commissions. Convened taskforces. And made multimillion—even multibillion—dollar promises to restore the sea. But these plans, some of which have been debated for almost two decades, have not changed the day-to-day reality for many who live in the area. Now the Salton Sea is at a crossroads. It is a potentially vast source of lithium - an essential ingredient in the batteries that power the green economy. Audrey Carleton: Lithium, it’s been called “white gold” it’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas. Tamara Winter: That’s Audrey Carleton. Audrey Carleton: I am an environmental journalist for Vice. I wrote this story on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote-un-quote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: Leading car companies are increasing the number of electric vehicles they can produce. Tesla made headlines last fall for having a market valuation greater than Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, Ford, and GM combined. But GM’s stated transformative goals set them apart. Audrey Carleton: General Motors is kind of paving the way. So, they made a first in the nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. Archived audio: Person 1: General Motors plans to stop making gas powered cars by 2035… Person 2: On the assembly line at this GM plant outside Detroit there are two things autoworkers…will never see again internal combustion engines, and gas tanks. Audrey Carleton: Because they are like the American automaker and they’ve made this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. Tamara Winter: Right now it’s estimated that almost 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United states come from transportation. So it’s understandable why GM’s plans are so ambitious. And their dedication to lithium mining is so strong. Audrey Carleton: They’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the EV space in doing so and in order to make that happen they’re going to need a lot of lithium so General Motors struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. Tamara Winter: Enter the Salton Sea. The US Department of Energy estimates that the sea could be the source of up to 600,000 tons of lithium. Per year. In fact, the Salton Sea is… Michael McKibben: …the largest brine source of lithium in the world. Tamara Winter: That’s Dr. Michael McKibben. He’s an Emeritus Professor of Geology at the University of California Riverside. He’s also one of the authors of a recent report on energy resources—including lithium—at the Salton Sea. To understand how lithium will be extracted at Salton Sea, we first need to talk about why it’s there in the first place. That’s a journey that starts millions of years ago, and thousands of miles away. The Colorado River snakes and curves across the southwestern United States passing through parts of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and finally California. The waters of the river have traveled that route for millions of years slowly eating away at sandstone and sediment. It was these waters that carved out the Grand Canyon. Over millennia the river carried all of the rock and mineral it eroded away. Occasionally, when hard rains fell, or there was heavy snowmelt in the Rockies, the river waters rose. And in southern California, the river would burst its banks and the parched Imperial Valley would be filled. Temporarily. The ancient lakes that formed became central to the lives and mythologies of the native peoples who lived in the area. Quechans, Chemehuevis, Cahuillas, and Kumeyaays gathered on the lake’s shores and fished their waters. The presence of these lakes can still be seen. The largest and most recent, called Lake Cahuilla, left what are called ‘bathtub rings’, or marks on the surrounding rockfaces indicating where its waters once stopped. Repeated flooding and evaporation over thousands of years left behind sediment full of minerals and trace metals, picked up as the river rushed from the Rockies to the sea. Among those metals: lithium. A lot of lithium. Dr. Michael McKibben explains just how much. Michael McKibben: Sort of back of the envelope calculation estimates I’ve done are somewhere on the order of two million to six million metric tons of lithium. Tamara Winter: A million, or six million, of anything is a lot, but Dr. McKibben puts those numbers into perspective. Michael McKibben: You know, even if we just produce a faction of it every year we could supply all US needs for lithium and actually have enough left over to export it to other countries. That would totally reverse the situation the U.S. is in where we’re now importing over 95% of the lithium we need. Tamara Winter: Right now, most lithium is mined outside the United States. Australia, Chile, Argentina, and China are all home to robust mining operations. But it’s not just the fact that the Salton Sea is in the United States that makes it such an attractive source of lithium. It’s the way lithium can be extracted. Right now, there are two common ways lithium is mined: open-pit, and evaporation. Open-pit mining is especially common in Australia. Archived audio: It’s vast and remote here in Pilbara and rich in minerals. Tamara Winter: Pilbara: sparsely populated and full of lithium. It’s home to growing mining operations. Archived audio: A new mine has recently opened here with the aim of becoming one of the biggest lithium mines in the world. Tamara Winter: That clip is from 2018. Since then, global demand for lithium has grown. And mining operations have become more and more lucrative. Archived audio: But we do things differently here. Mining hard rock lithium. Tamara Winter: In this type of mining, lithium-rich rocks are blasted apart. Pulverized. And soaked in sulphuric acid. Places like Pilbara are the ideal location for this kind of mining. It’s a region slightly larger than Iraq, but with barely more than 60,000 residents. But the pits still leave deep scars across the land. And acid runoff contaminates water supplies. The other type of mining used to collect lithium is evaporation mining. This practice is most common in South America and involves pumping groundwater from underneath dry lake beds and salt flats into enormous evaporation ponds. For example, the ponds at the Atacama salt flat form a checkerboard that stretches almost 30 square miles. In addition to taking up a lot of land, this type of mining uses large quantities of water in areas where it is already scarce. Indigenous communities near the Atacama salt flats have lost access to water and those opposed to mining fear for the fate of local wildlife if the mining operation continues. Archived audio: Sonya Ramos believes that lithium mining is killing this desert. A growing number of Chilean scientists agree and have come to the Atacama to join her campaign to stop it. Tamara Winter: So, the irony here is clear. Mining lithium—the metal that is crucial to a global transition to clean energy, can create environmental issues of its own. Added to this is another uncomfortable reality: currently the most developed nations in the world have the highest demand for lithium. But it’s sourced from some of the poorest. As Dr. Michael McKibben notes… Michael McKibben: We’re letting all the environmental problems occur in these other countries to satisfy our need for lithium. Tamara Winter: But this is where the Salton Sea comes in. The way that lithium will be gathered from the Imperial Valley is so different from open-pit and evaporation mining that Dr. McKibben hesitates to call it mining at all. Michael McKibben: The thing I worry about most is people understanding direct lithium extraction in the context of how lithium is mined elsewhere in the world. And that’s really our biggest challenge is we shouldn’t call it lithium mining at the Salton Sea—we should call it lithium extraction because it’s not mining in the traditional sense of the word. Tamara Winter: The process called direct lithium extraction involves using some of the green energy infrastructure already at the Salton Sea and repurposing it to collect lithium in addition to creating clean energy. There are already large scale geothermal energy projects at the Salton Sea. Everett and I saw some of them when we visited. Everett Katigbak: Maybe describe we’re seeing, Tammy. Tamara Winter: Okay, well this is a geothermal plant. It’s interesting…everything looks rusted by the way…it’s a lot larger than I thought when we were first driving in. You’ve got these giant, round cylinders with scaffolding at the top I guess. Tamara Winter: They draw hot saline brine, rich in metals and minerals, to the surface. As the brine is brought up, the change in pressure causes it to boil. The steam from the brine turns turbines creating electricity. Usually the brine and the recondensed steam are pumped back into the ground so the process can begin again. Direct lithium extraction basically places a filter on this process. Using other elements to draw the lithium out of the brine after it has already been brought to the surface. Then the brine, minus some lithium, is pumped back into the ground. Geothermal electricity is created. Lithium is extracted. And the only remnants are the brine and water. The potential for geothermal energy and lithium extraction at Salton Sea is especially promising because of California’s green energy goals. Michael McKibben: So California is now legislatively mandated to have its electrical grid be based on all renewables by 2045. And so that means we need more geothermal energy to satisfy that requirement and we need more lithium storage batteries to store electricity. Tamara Winter: This new commitment to renewables means that California is ready to invest in more geothermal energy. The state—famously situated on a fault line—has huge geothermal potential. But geothermal has long played third fiddle to wind and solar because of the high cost of building power plants. Now, as California works to decarbonize, the growth in demand for geothermal energy could provide an influx of well-paying jobs and political attention to the Imperial Valley. Michael McKibben: The state public utilities commission just asked for 1000 megawatts more of geothermal energy and the only place that can be supplied by really is the Salton Sea geothermal field. So they may have to double or triple the number of geothermal powerplants down there over the next decade to satisfy the demand for renewable energy. Tamara Winter: This could be an avenue to even more green industry. More geothermal plants means more potential for lithium extraction. But extraction is only the first step. Currently almost 80% of lithium ion batteries are made in China. If lithium extraction at the Salton Sea is successful, it is entirely possible that the area will become the ideal location for large scale domestic battery production. All of this potential is politically attractive. Presidents from both parties have championed the idea of “energy independence” for decades. Archived audio: Gerald Ford: Good evening. Last January 15th I went before your senators and representatives in congress with a comprehensive plan to make our country independent of foreign sources of energy by 1985… Archived audio: Ronald Reagan: ...technologies and more independence from foreign oil. Archived audio: George H. W. Bush: ...there is no security for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil. [Cheering] Archived audio Bill Clinton: I have repeatedly called in this campaign for more energy independence for America… Archived audio: George W. Bush: One of the greatest results of using hydrogen power of course will be energy independence for this nation. Archived audio: Barack Obama: We are closer to energy independence than we’ve ever been before… Archived audio: Donald Trump: We have energy independence right now… Archived audio: Joe Biden: …quote “energy independent” which is a phrase that’s thrown around… Tamara Winter: Energy independence. A political catch phrase that is so popular because it can mean, well, almost anything. Does it mean opening up protected lands for oil drilling? Expanding fracking operations? Investing in wind power and solar arrays? Well, depending on who is speaking it could be any of those. Or all of them. But the underlying desire for stable, domestic sources of energy makes a lot of sense. And as the globe transitions to green energy, the benefits of significant domestic production of lithium and lithium batteries will only grow. The question remains: will lithium extraction do what no other industry has accomplished and bring political attention and well-paying jobs to the Imperial Valley? Archived audio: Infrastructure turned this desert into productive farmland, but young people…worry that there’s no political will to help this delicate ecosystem and the families who live here. Tamara Winter: For decades the communities near the Salton Sea have heard government promises of investment. And while there is a lot of hope about what lithium extraction could mean, there is also some understandable suspicion. Archived audio: Person 1: Anecdotally after windy days we see a lot more asthma patients coming in. Person 2: Myself and my family developed asthma while living here. Tamara Winter: Childhood asthma rates are more than twice as high in the area around the Salton Sea than in the rest of California. As the sea continues to shrink… Archived audio: This area used to be water…but now obviously it’s dry here and the shoreline is hundreds of yards in this direction. Tamara Winter: …more and more fine dust particles are exposed. And risk rises. The hope is that, through lithium extraction, not only will the area receive an economic boost, but that efforts to restore the area will also gain attention and urgency. Roy Durantes: For a very long time the state was the number one entity working to restore the Salton Sea and to be honest with you things were going very slow. Tamara Winter: Roy Durantes is a former news producer and the founder of a group called “Saving the Salton Sea.” He’s also the director of the Salton Sea Film Festival, which gives local youth the opportunity to document their experiences of the area. Roy Durantes: I am not an expert. I am just a concerned resident. I know some people who suffer asthma. And one of my very close friends had some asthma seizures. The playa dries, all these contaminants that have been dormant there for practically 100 years could dry up and become airborne could become dust and go into the region and into people’s lungs. Tamara Winter: Durantes worries that the speed of the state’s response does not match the rate at which the environmental disaster is escalating. Roy Durantes: If you look at the playa exposure. This thing, man, is drying. It’s almost like in a race to dry up and we’re in a race to stop it from drying up because we don’t want to turn this into a ghost town. Tamara Winter: But there are still open questions around what lithium extraction will mean for the Imperial Valley. One thing is certain: lithium operations will grow in coming years. Global demand is expected to rise by over 800% in the next decade. So as this new layer of energy infrastructure is being created, it’s important to ask the right questions. At the Salton Sea, an area that has seen economic and political promise come and go, all these questions are playing out in real time. As Dr. McKibben explains… Michael McKibben: So part of the challenge to the geothermal companies and then those of us who are doing research down there is to educate the public about what’s going on and to help them understand that this is not traditional lithium mining that we’re talking about. Tamara Winter: A little bit like the L.A. Times in 1966 envisioning the area as the next Palm Springs, there is a potentially thrilling future in the making at the Salton Sea. One where lithium extraction is a success, battery factories are built, well-paying jobs flood the Imperial Valley like the Colorado River waters, and the environmental crisis at the Sea is contained. That’s a future Roy Durantes can see. Roy Durantes: What’s important is the thousands of families who are here. The thousands of kids, the thousands of people. My hope for the area is that the Salton Sea is restored so that it becomes a place of business. A place of industry. A place of recreation. A place of economy. A lot of us are very expectant and very hopeful. We want to see something happen. We want people to bring in solutions. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press.

To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and more, visit press.stripe.com That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the second episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Audrey Carleton. She is an environmental journalist and multimedia producer who writes for Motherboard, the science and technology arm of VICE. She covers all aspects of the global transition to green energy. In our conversation she discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea. She also draws on her experience covering the oil and natural gas industries to help explain why local environmental and social justice groups have reservations about the lithium operations. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Audrey Carleton. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, why are we talking today? Audrey Carleton: So we’re talking today because a couple of months ago, General Motors, which is America’s car maker, basically, struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. For context GM made this first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, they’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the, in the EV space in doing so. And in order to make that happen, they’re gonna need a lot of lithium. So they have staked out this area with Controlled Thermal Resources in Southern California called the Salton Sea which is a really interesting place because it’s this very toxic, very salty lake. It’s, it’s just a interesting place. And there’s a lot of kind of sociopolitical dynamics going on here, but essentially the goal is to mine for lithium using existing geothermal power plants and use that lithium to create EV batteries and achieve this goal of, you know, being all electric by 2035. Tamara Winter: So you recently wrote about Salton Sea. Tell me a little bit about that. Audrey Carleton: So back in July, I wrote this story for Motherboard on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote unquote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, what is the Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So the Salton Sea is not actually a sea. It is sort of a lake. And it’s kind of an accidental one. It was created in 1905 as kind of like an offshoot of the Colorado River. So essentially the Colorado River spilled out of its irrigation system into this one kind of reservoir in the very southern tip of California near Baja. It’s also kind of near Joshua Tree, if you’re familiar with that area. It sits around 200 feet below sea level. And it doesn’t have an outlet. So there’s, you know, water kind of flows into it from the Colorado River, but it doesn’t flow out of it. So it just kind of sits there and the way that the water level is managed is water kind of evaporates off of it. And that process leaves behind a lot of salt and a lot of minerals. So it’s become, over the years, incredibly salty, I think somewhere around 50% saltier than the Pacific Ocean. So it’s not the most habitable place for animals or people. It’s in the middle of the desert, but you know, it’s, it’s a really kind of interesting, interesting area from a social kind of demographic standpoint. I believe the last numbers I saw on unemployment in the region were around 20%. So pretty high. So, you know, I think we could call this in, in one future day, if, if this does become a real lithium hub I think it will be a place where environmental justice questions are like really at the forefront of who’s involved in the economic boon that this creates, who kind of benefits from it and who is potentially harmed. I think there are a ton, a ton of interesting questions, all kind of hovering around this area. And after I published this story for VICe, I will admit, this is probably the one story that has gotten me the most, the most response, because this is like an extremely hot button controversial issue. Tamara Winter: I want to get back to some of that after we set some context for folks who may not be familiar with things like what lithium even is and why Salton Sea is, is so toxic. So Audrey, what is lithium? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Great question. It is an element, you might remember it from the periodic table and it is a key ingredient in lithium ion batteries. So specifically, it’s extremely conductive. What that means is it has an extra electron on its outer shell and that electron because it just has the one it wants to be moving around and glamming onto other elements and creating bonds and in bouncing around so much, it creates an electrical current. So it’s highly conductive and when it’s shoved into batteries, it makes, you know, a really strong electrical current. It’s also unbelievably flammable. So these lithium battery fires are kind of a growing issue that we’ve also been working on at VICE. It’s, it’s because it’s so conductive, it’s really hard to put out and fires kind of spread in this crazy way because this one electron just wants to glam onto other things and they can be really hard to control. That’s a little bit tangential, but you know, lithium is, it’s been called white gold. It’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas because we need batteries in order to create electric vehicles and to create battery storage. Batteries will be the key to holding onto the energy that’s generated from wind and solar. In, you know, in kind of building up that infrastructure. It’s super important. I mean, one of the main kind of counterpoints that people always say about wind and solar is, well not everywhere is windy and the sun is only out for half the day, less than that during wintertime. So how are we going to, you know, generate constant energy storage or have sort of a constant, reliable energy source if these things are not around for, if they’re only around for a short amount of time and the answer is, is batteries you generate electrical current and you store it into a battery and then that’s, you know, used for later, but we need to be creating batteries and mining for minerals or elements like lithium in order to do that. And, you know, lithium’s a crucial one and it’s got a, gotten a lot of attention, but there are other elements that have kind of been that are like essential to battery creation too. Like cobalt. But it’s sort of the big one. Tamara Winter: How is lithium mined typically? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Yeah. So Lithium’s kind of an interesting element. It doesn’t exist in a pure state in the earth. That’s usually glommed on with you know, another element. So it’s often mined in this process called open-pit mining, and thisrefers to the kind of technique for mining. And that’s used also in like coal mining and mining for lots of other things, but specifically with lithium, essentially what happens is a few feet of earth is dredged up. Usually open-pit is used and with open-pit mining, this is usually done with whatever the mineral or element that is being mined is pretty close to the surface of the earth. So you just kind of just dig up some earth. A few feet, few hundred feet. And create an open space, and that will make way for the minerals that you’re looking for. This process is done with coal mining for example, this is the same process that leads to mountaintop removal which is extremely controversial and really environmentally destructive. But with lithium mining, it’s, you don’t quite have to go that deep, it often creates these sort of flats. They kinda look like salt flats. You may have seen, you know, like these aerial images of lithium mines, they’re these kind of vast greenish whiteish kind of, honestly like really beautiful looking mines. And what happens is when that earth is dredged up, it gives way for this sort of salty, muddy briney stuff that then the water is evaporated off of it. And that leaves just the minerals behind. And then those are distilled and lithium is taken from it. And this is done typically, I mean, there’s, this is sort of a new thing for the U.S., but there’s this one region in South America called the lithium triangle in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. And there’s these massive lithium mines there. And that’s sort of the process there is open-pit mining and the one consequence to this, the few consequences to this is that it’s very water intensive, it creates a fair amount of mineral waste. And, you know, the health consequences of being around open-pit mines are sort of unknown. There’s this one lithium mine in Nevada, in this region called Thacker Pass that’s gotten a lot of attention and been very, very controversial because it would sort of require doing this same process and dredging into this one mountain. And you know, I think a lot of concern around this process is valid because we just, you know, it’s relatively new, we just don’t know a ton about it. So we, it’s sort of, it’s sort of like a new frontier, like a new unknown, what, what it’s gonna, you know, what kind of consequences it’s gonna hold for the people who work in this industry and the people who live nearby it. Tamara Winter: And I am gonna jump out of order here, but I’m curious how CTR’s process differs from open-pit mining. Audrey Carleton: Yeah, sure. So, Controlled Thermal Resources has proposed a slightly different process from the typical sort of open-pit mining process. The Salton Sea is already home to a number of geothermal plants so those are power plants that take heat and steam from deep beneath the earth. It’s kind of the same heat and steam that you might see in a geyser, and it’s a renewable resource. I mean, we will always have these stores of heat underneath the earth. And you know, these geothermal mines take this up and generate energy from it and then pump that back into the earth. So it’s renewable. What CTR has proposed is taking brine as a byproduct of these power plants and extracting lithium from it, and then sending that same water back into the earth. So it’s essentially taking a byproduct of an existing energy generation process and taking a mineral out of it and then returning what was already going to be going back underground into the earth. The company has been firm that this process is less water intensive and less wasteful. And generally just kind of better for the environment than open-pit mining and requires a lot less in terms of land use. Because that’s another thing with mining is that it uses a ton of land and you know, like maybe years down the line, we’re seeing this with coal mines, at least in the infrastructure package, there’s sort of a push to reforest old coal mines and that’s possible, but it takes a lot of work. And so that’s one, one other consequence of, of traditional mining is just how much it takes in terms of land. And you know, that is land that takes a lot of work to get it back to the way that it was or if you even can get it back to the way that it was. So, you know, this process kind of takes advantage of existing infrastructure. But that said, I mean, they’re still working out the kinks of what exactly this is gonna look like and, and what they need to build and what they need to create in order for, you know, this, this lithium valley or this, they calling it ‘hell’s kitchen’. This region of California to become a real lithium mining area. They’re still kind of working out what that’s gonna look like in terms of infrastructure. So the land use question is kind of still, it’s still there. Tamara Winter: And I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but I’m going to ask it again. What companies right now are really interested in mining lithium in Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So General Motors is kind of the big one that’s staking its claim in this region, but California has created a commission, the Lithium Valley Commission, to kind of oversee the process and turn this area into the home of an industry. I think of it as like a second Silicon Valley, because the names are so similar, but General Motors is kind of paving the way. So they made a first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, because they’re like the American automaker and you know, they’ve made this, this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time, they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. It’s going to say, if this works, it’s going to say to other automakers, look, we can do this, here’s how you can do it as well, we can live in an electric vehicle country, you know, within, within a reasonable amount of time. And it could turn this area into a real hotbed. It could really make this part of California, like an actual lithium valley, you know? So I think it’ll be interesting to see what happens. But we’re still a couple years away from that because the deal, you know, with this one mine is still kind of being figured out. Tamara Winter: Why is it so important to mine more and more lithium? Why is there particularly such interest right now? Audrey Carleton: Yeah. That’s a great question. So lithium is a crucial element in the creation of batteries. And batteries are going to be essential in the transition away from fossil fuels because they hold on to energy that can be, you know, kind of created at any time and they make broadly speaking, they make renewable resources more reliable and more sustainable. Wind and solar are often kind of critiqued as being unreliable resources because the sun only shines for a certain amount of time every day and the wind is not everywhere, not all parts of the world are windy, and the wind doesn’t blow all the time. It doesn’t blow at the same speed. So how can we rely on these resources? Well, the answer is with batteries. By taking that energy and storing it somewhere, we have it to use for later during periods when it’s nighttime or periods, when it’s, there’s not as much of wind as a resource, we have that energy that we can rely on. With electric vehicles specifically, what that means is that each car has a battery and that gets plugged into a charger, but the energy that that charger pulls from the grid can come from any number of resources. So it’s kind of a mix right now. It could come from oil and gas. It could come from renewables, but the goal is to transition the entire energy grid to renewables and be able to pull energy from that and store it in cars with batteries. Batteries are essential for everything for the broader kind of transition to renewables. They’re essential for cars because they eliminate the likelihood that you’re using fossil fuels to power your car, because the energy that you’re pulling and storing in that battery could come from any number of things. As long as it’s energy, it can be stored in a battery, essentially. It’s just electrical current. Tamara Winter: Are there environmental risks to lithium mining? Audrey Carleton: I mean the main things are the land questions, the land use questions and also the water that’s required. And the waste. So those are the three big ones is that it’s this process that just requires a lot of water to generate, you know, to pull minerals out of these briney kind of flats. And it, you know, requires a ton of land. A lot of land has to be staked out to create these mines. And in, you know, like Thacker Pass that’s land that’s on the top of a mountain. It’s also land that is on and near Indigenous communities. So that’s very, you know, valuable, culturally valuable and really, really important land. It’s the water, it’s the land and it’s the waste. There’s a lot of mineral waste that’s generated in this process as well. So, you know, CTR, Controlled Thermal Resources aims to kind of cut those out of the process by just using a byproduct of existing infrastructure. But it’s also kind of a new technology that they have created. Tamara Winter: And who lives in and around Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: The community around the Salton Sea is fairly low income. Historically on average, there are a lot of Latino communities in that region. And this would be, if this goes well, and the jobs were given to people in this community, it would be a real boon. I think from what I gauged when I was reporting on this story there is a fair amount of distrust because there were some solar projects that went up in the region a few years ago that did not end up having the jobs go to the community. That’s sort of historically how these things go. I mean, solar’s a little bit different and renewables we’re still kind of learning, but with oil and gas projects, often what happens is, you know, a pipeline will go up or oil wells will go up, or drill rigs. And the people who work on those rigs are often not people from the community. They are people who work for the company and travel around and go from region to region. And so that’s how you sort of hear about these like abandoned or these sort of ghost oil towns in, you know, in the Permian Basin in Texas is, the industry will kind of move into a region. It will be a huge boon that helps all sectors of life. I mean, the value of everything goes up when there’s a resource like this that’s so valuable and, and becomes such a part of the economy. Everything from like haircuts to like how much your coffee costs, everybody’s just making more money for that short amount of time. But then once that resource dries up, those workers move away, they go onto a new place. That’s also how you hear about these, these sort of man camps of workers who kind of move into this region and work for a period of time and then move to the next one with their company. That’s sort of the trajectory that we’ve seen with fossil fuels. I think there’s still a lot that we’re seeing around the construction of all renewable infrastructure, including mines for elements like lithium. But I think the number one concern that anybody has when something like this pops up in their region is who’s going to be benefiting from it. And if this doesn’t become something that could lift up the community around the Salton Sea and flow cash into it and really become an economic boon for that region and the people that have lived there for decades then it’s kind of like, who’s it for? What are the consequences, what are the trade offs, what’s being sacrificed in order to make this happen? And, you know, if this mining typically is not great, I mean, mining is like kind of a dangerous, dangerous process. Coal mining we have seen comes with like countless health consequences and lithium mining is still kind of being studied, but you know, if there are harms and those harms are kind of inflicted on the people who live in that region, but at the same time, they’re not really given, you know, the local jobs then that’s like a really unfortunate trade off. That’s a really, really unfortunate situation. And it would be kind of an injustice for that to happen. Fortunately, it’s looking like that’s not going to be the process, but I think that is the fear. And so, you know, the folks that I talked to when I was reporting this story out said that people in the community hadn’t really been informed of the mines going up, but were open to being part of that. If it was something that was, that proved to be kind of a financial boon for the region. But you know, they just kind of want to have a stake in the process. And that’s why this Lithium Valley Commission is so important. It’s kind of a multi-stakeholder body. It’s got you know, folks from the company. It’s got folks from the local government in Imperial County in California. It’s got a couple of members from like local community development organizations and nonprofits on it. So it really does have a lot of different voices at the table. And you know, I think if this mine comes also with something like training programs for folks who live in the region and you know, kind of job development programs, then we could see this be something that really does benefit the whole community. But you know, that’s, I think the nuances of that are still are still being worked out. And the one government official who I spoke to in Imperial County when I was reporting this story out, said that so far, you know, I asked him like, does it seem like, you know, the voices of people who live in this region are really gonna be heard, like who has more say, you know, on this, on this panel. And he was like, well, everybody’s getting along for now, so… which is good looking out in the future, but we’ll see. I mean, there’s just any number of directions this could go. Tamara Winter: Wow. Audrey Carleton: I think a lot about the term like ‘sacrifice zone’ which is one that’s commonly used to talk about oil and gas projects. And even in Brooklyn, there was this pipeline that went up, has gone up over the last couple of years. And that term was kind of used a lot, was like you know, this region is a ‘sacrifice zone’ for this infrastructure. With pipelines it’s a little bit different because it’s kind of like, you know this infrastructure just runs through your area, but it doesn’t really create any jobs other than the jobs that are required to build it in the first place. But then once it’s built, it’s kind of built. With a mine it’s a little different because I think you know there’s a more steady kind of flow of work involved in that process. But yeah, I mean, nothing is really guaranteed and we see this all the time with fossil fuel projects where, you know, there’s been some semblance of input from a local community that for example, like really needs funding for education or really needs funding for a certain, you know, social good. And so when they get the chance to kind of tap into something like, you know, some sort of resource that’s really, really lucrative then they’ll often, you know, leaders will ultimately decide to say yes to it, but it’s a trade off. Because it does come with health consequences and then often that, that doesn’t end up panning out the jobs.There’s no commitments or no contracts that say the jobs have to go to people who live in that region. So these are kind of promises that are often made in the first kind of planning stages of a project, but aren’t ever really kept. That’s not to say that’s always what happens, but it is a very distinct possibility with any project that you know, it’s not that this trade off ends up being like the people who live here and have lived here forever, and for whom this is really their home and their community, they don’t get any of the benefits of this. In fact, they just get an influx of people from outside who come and that can lead to all kinds of things. It can lead to displacement/ I mean if we compare this to the Silicon Valley and look at the displacement that happened in Northern California as a result of that. You know, that’s a distinct possibility here. But mostly, I mean, when I think about these things, I think about the health impacts cause there’s pretty much no form of resource extraction that comes without any kind of health consequence for the people who live near it, whether that’s like air pollution in particulate matter and asthma or you know, ingesting like runoff and toxins that have leached into your waterways. Like all of these things come with consequences. And so if it were to be that the community and the Salton Sea only kind of gets those negative consequences and none of the benefits, none of the economic benefits that they’re saying, you know, they’re expressing interest in, that they’re saying that they want, then, that would be like a huge injustice. But I mean, if I’m being frank, I think it’s one that like a company like General Motors would be able to get away with because oil and gas companies have been doing this kind of thing for years. And there’s only recent attention to environmental justice as a concept. But you know, there’s nothing that would, I don’t know, I guess I’m just cynical. I think that the company would probably be able to get away with it. Tamara Winter: I don’t know if I totally disagree, you know, I hope that people will keep writing about it and talking about it. And I do wonder if the tide is turning a little bit. But yeah, I don’t, I don’t know if we have like full, like a hundred percent reason to be optimistic. I know, I’m going to wind get this down and basically just ask you one, is there anything that I, that you think is really important that I, or listeners of the podcast should know that we haven’t talked about? Audrey Carleton: I feel like we’ve covered a lot of stuff. We’ve covered a fair amount of ground. I would say, I just think this is going to be a new, massive frontier in kind of the energy transition. There are probably going to be mines popping up all over the place and other mines. I mean, this one is not as controversial, but the Thacker Pass Mine in Nevada has become like wildly controversial and sort of represents this new intense kind of question of like, what are we willing to sacrifice in order to get to a renewable economy and whether we can kind of maintain the scale of consumption that we’re at and still, you know, avert the climate crisis. Like I think that this question around lithium is so interesting from an environmental perspective, but also weirdly like a philosophical one because you know, we have certain needs that we, as a species have gotten used to having like heat and electricity and cars and the ability to travel and the ability to shop and go places and mail people things. And if we want to maintain that, we’re gonna need an energy source, but no energy source comes without consequences. So it’s kind of just about minimizing those things. And I think this is a really interesting time to be looking at this right now because it’s so new, but I think that we are only going to continue to see more mines and more protests and more lawsuits against companies that are aiming to mine. And I also really staunchly believe that if we want to see a just transition, that means that we cannot treat people and the earth in the way that the fossil fuel and the coal industry has treated people and the earth. And, you know, those processes of permitting plants and permitting drill rigs and stuff and oil wells historically have been rife with violations and like, you know, like bad things happen in oil fields every day. There is illegal dumping all the time, you know, like this is a really, really difficult space to regulate. And I think if we want, you know, our new renewable economy to not come with some of those negative things, we need to hold these companies that are leading it to account. And so I think this is gonna be just like a really interesting sign of where we’re at in terms of that to see, how the creation of these minds play, plays out. And I think it’s like a really interesting, the Lithium Valley Commission and this one community and, you know, the kind of dynamics, the political dynamics at play here are really kind of interesting litmus test of that. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. Audrey, thank you so much for this. I learned a ton. I read your article, which is fantastic, but I learned a ton in just talking with you. So I’m so grateful that you took time to chat with me. I really appreciate it. Audrey Carleton: Yeah. Thank you so much. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our associate producer and editor was Astrid Landon. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and a whole lot more, visit press.stripe.com. Alright, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: The global supply chain is like an industrial ballet. An intricately choreographed dance of manufacturers, distributors, and transportation infrastructure that physically moves materials and products across the globe. However just like a ballet, when one dancer stumbles - the whole production can go sideways very quickly. Archived audio: This is what the traffic bottleneck looks like at the ports of LA and Long Beach. Tamara Winter: In the fall of 2021, with holidays fast approaching, a record number of ships sat waiting just off of the Port of Long Beach, California, unable to unload billions worth of cargo. Fifty miles north in Malibu, the pristine coastline looked more like the area’s notoriously congested freeways. Cargo ships also stretched south, some 100 miles or so towards San Diego, not too far from the border of Mexico. Archived audio: The backup is mostly due to a surge in imports because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tamara Winter: Online sales increased more than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic, and continued to rise throughout 2021. Local lockdowns, and physical constraints on workforces, compounded the problem until, in the lead up to the holidays, it reached a breaking point. Archived audio: The complex delays at the nation’s busiest ports, accounting for 40% of the country’s container traffic, affects consumers from coast to coast. Tamara Winter: One person monitoring the situation closely was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a technology platform for global logistics. When he heard the news stories about the backlogs at California ports, he took action. He hired a boat, toured the ports, and then he took to Twitter. In 30 tweets he laid out his five-point plan to ease the bottleneck. Soon he was on the phone with California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia was implementing some of his recommendations. So how does someone end up writing what came to be known as “the tweetstorm that saved Christmas”? Welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press all about big ideas in infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter and today we are sitting down with Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen to understand how he thinks about trade, the way he understands the intersection of government and technology, and why he founded Flexport in the first place. We cover a lot of ground talking about everything from ancient trade routes to what Flexport is doing to help during the present crisis in Ukraine. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Ryan Petersen. Tamara Winter: This is a really long time coming. I almost feel like the hipsters, like I knew you before, my dad was reading like cover stories about you. People now know you for donating lots of money to Ukraine or saving Christmas, but some of us, some of us have been here before that. Maybe we’ll start with what is Flexport? Ryan Petersen: Well, Flexport is a technology platform for global logistics. We make it possible for companies of any size to ship anything anywhere. And simply that process try to bring kind of utility grade infrastructure to an industry that’s kind of taped together by duct tape and emailed Excel files and PDF attachments and stuff. And we can make this seamless, our mission is to make global trade easy for everyone, but we want to make trade so easy there will be more trade as a result of when we’re finished. 20 years ago, I ran a small business buying products and China and selling them on the internet and was very frustrated by my experience, dealing with logistics and felt just like…George Bernard Shaw says every profession is a conspiracy against the laity. And it felt like that, like anytime I dealt with these companies, it just seemed like there was, nobody could tell me where my stuff was, how much it was gonna cost, whatever they told me, ended up costing more, a lot of really confusing paperwork, regulations, documents that were needed, data that needed to be collected and shared with the governments and stuff. And it just, nobody was there to hold my hand and make this easy for me. And it’s an industry full of code words, acronyms and Viking English, weird language is used all the time. And kind of like an all boys club, literally an all boys club, there’s lot of men working in this industry. And like, it’s very hard to parse as an outsider. When you’d ask someone to explain it to you—my working model now that I’ve kind of been on the other side is that I think that the industry treats these words, these acronyms, this lingo, as kind of a rookie detector. And it’s kind of icky. Like I want to work with companies that just want help people. And it should be a really fun industry. You get to help entrepreneurs, you get to help businesses achieve their goals, right? But it’s so important. Like we probably lifted a billion people outta poverty in the last 50 years through free market economics and adoption of global, free trading type policies around the world. And yeah, it’s like, here’s something that’s really important, interesting in my view, fun and really broken. It’s like, it’s a good heat map for where you should go work and what you could, what, where you could like build a career and do something interesting. Tamara Winter: In a word, the thing that you’re fixing is transaction costs, it’s funny. I was born in Nigeria and every time I go back, my mom’s like, “Look, if we’re at the market, don’t say anything”, because as soon as I do, it’s like, you sound like an NPR host, I’m immediately gonna charge you, you know, 40% more or whatever. Ryan Petersen: This is when you go back now? Tamara Winter: Yeah, exactly. Right. Ryan Petersen: How old were you when you left Nigeria? Tamara Winter: Two months. I just want to get into, you know, you live and breathe logistics so much so that, tell me about your daughter’s Halloween costume last year. Ryan Petersen: Well, my wife gets all my credit for this. We dressed my daughter, she made a wagon into a container ship, like a little radio flyer wagon, and made it into the Evergiven container ship. And we dressed my daughter like a sailor and had her drive, you know, ride around and pulled her around in that thing. And we even at some point blocked traffic with it. Tamara Winter: [laughs] But I’m sure nobody minded because it’s like this beautiful little girl just being driven around. Ryan Petersen: It was super fun. Tamara Winter: Tell me about, so we talked about, why you started, how you got to starting Flexport, but I wanna go back even earlier. What was your upbringing like? How does somebody raise a child that goes on to, you know, I don’t know, save Christmas? Ryan Petersen: [laughs] Saving Christmas. So my mom is an entrepreneur actually. And she’s an expert on food safety and like regulations, the intersection of food safety and government regulations. So helping companies to comply with food safety regs and, and build healthier food supply chains. I do kind of think she raised my brother and I to be entrepreneurs. We used to get our allowance by delivering sodas to her office. And like we had to sell them, we would buy the sodas at Safeway or something, sell them to her office and make, you know, make a spread. Tamara Winter: [laughs] And then that was your allowance? Ryan Petersen: Yeah, that was how we got allowance. It was good money. She allowed us to overcharge her for the sodas. We’d go to Costco and buy, blow pops in bulk. And I’d sell them to all the other kids in my middle school. I don’t think at the time I was thinking about entrepreneurship, obviously, she never talked to me about that, but both my brother and I became entrepreneurs. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting how many parallels there are to different parts of the series, but the very first episode with Mwiya who is building a city in Zambia, his father was like one of the chief architects of Zambia’s finance ecosystem, but his mother was an entrepreneur. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, my mom’s a huge influence on me. My brother’s probably even more so. My brother’s a born entrepreneur too. And, when I graduated from college, I didn’t have a lot of prospects for gainful employment. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: I don’t know, I went to UC Berkeley. I was really interested in international development. The question of like, why are some countries poor and some countries rich? Tamara Winter: You didn’t want to become an economist? Ryan Petersen: I didn’t have the skillset for that. And then no, I didn’t wanna do like a PhD in economics. Honestly, I’m very skeptical of it all. So my brother hired me working for this trading company. Tamara Winter: Is he older or younger? Ryan Petersen: My older brother, yeah. And he was a computer programmer at Intel and he was taking his salary and using it to buy stuff in China and sell it on the internet. Just like very entrepreneurial. This is, late nineties, early 2000. So there was a tech startup scene, but we weren’t part of that. It was like just a couple kids trying to make some money. Tamara Winter: And are you from Berkeley? Ryan Petersen: Bethesda, Maryland. Washington DC. Tamara Winter: So this is interesting because you are sort of like right in the heart of government. And you’re in Bethesda. And for anyone who’s listening, who doesn’t know about Bethesda, Bethesda is where sort of the children of bureaucrats grow up. Ryan Petersen: Well, my dad worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. My dad’s a computer programmer actually, wrote his first code that was like in production, in use in the seventies when he was working, it was actually evaluating Soviet defense. Eventually my mom started this business that does food safety and she needed software to evaluate risk of pesticides and applying like, okay, if we use this pesticide, what will happen based on the dietary data of the whole United States population? What’s the safety implications of various pesticides? And so he wrote that software. And that’s still the software that the U.S. government uses to evaluate pesticide risk assessment in the United States, is written by my father. Tamara Winter: So in some ways the marriage of government and technology or commerce is just like a very natural one for you. I’m curious about your philosophical influences. I mean, I’m hearing some like Hayek in what you’re saying. I was looking at some of the books that you recommended and I mean, they’re everywhere from The Goal to just like interesting philosophical read. So tell me, who are the sort of intellectual influences on how you think? Ryan Petersen: The thing I love about reading is like, if, if you’re reading good books, every good book you read should point you to like two or three more. I don’t think I ever really read a book by the way, cover to cover on my own until I was about 25 years old. I’m serious. I like hacked my way through college and like, you know, found the Cliff Notes or whatever. When I was 25, I was living in China and running this sort of business that would export products from China, studying Chinese in the morning and exporting products to sell in the United States. I was living there and all of a sudden books became incredibly scarce and I was kind of bored. I didn’t have that many friends. And so when, you know, there’s not a lot of English bookstores at that time. In the part of China I was living. So I would go to Hong Kong and buy like a backpack full of books and bring ’em back. And so that’s when I really became a reader. I think I read over, over like 75 books in one year that year. And it’s become a real passion of mine. The biggest influences, I think that the aha moments where I was like, whoa, this changed my worldview, probably like Richard Dawkins and reading The Selfish Gene and understanding something about evolution and genetics. And then building from that is a book that really changed my worldview is called Complexity, Waldrop is the guy’s name. And it’s about complex adaptive systems. And this idea of feedback thresholds of complexity, when a system has enough interacting parts that at some point there’s this threshold of complexity it reaches, and it has emergent properties and it changes. So take hydrogen and oxygen. It’s pretty simple, but if you put them together, at some point you get enough of these molecules together and you got the emergent property of wetness of water, but there’s nothing about hydrogen or oxygen that if you looked at them, you would say, oh, this will—there’s wetness here. Like, no, it happens at some level of complexity when you put enough of these together. And so that was the first book that set me on that. And the one that I found that I really recommend to people, it’s not a book, it’s an Audible course called Big History. And it’s the application of complexity theory to the history of the world starting at the Big Bang all the way to the present. And then when you start to see that you can apply that in business is when it gets really fun. And that many, you know, it’s many of these things are just fascinating to watch, be able to apply an idea from one discipline to another. I think that’s where you get the most innovation is taking an idea from biology and applying it to business. Society tends to create specialists. And I really like being a generalist, understanding a little bit about everything and then you get creativity because you’re putting ideas from different disciplines that no one ever thought to combine. And my most recent inspiration has been a guy named John Boyd who’s a military strategist and talks about, how do you manage volatility and chaos, which is something that the military has to be really good at. And what is, what are the attributes of an organization that in the middle of complete chaos fog of war, what’s going on here can still take decisive action and not be caught like in survival mode and fail. And I think that’s something I’ve been trying to apply a lot at Flexport because we’re in a lot of chaos all the time. And if we can make sure we’re still playing offense, like understanding what’s happening around us and taking decisive action and then learning based on our actions. Tamara Winter: Okay. Tell me about trade routes. Maybe you can paint a picture for me sort of about the evolution of modern logistics. Ryan Petersen: Oh wow. Oh, well trade is something there’s, there’s evidence of long distance trade between human beings that far predates even things like art. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Possibly predates language like 10, 50,000 or more years ago, you can, you can find evidence that humans were transporting things over a long distance. It goes for a really long time, even like the invention of the boat. The invention of the boat happened in like Mesopotamia, where what they were actually doing is transporting goods down river. And what they would do is build these wooden boats, cover them with animal skins so they could float down river and then scrap the boat, but keep the animal skins and hike back and do that over and over again. That was tens of thousands of years ago, like before agriculture, even. So this is an ancient, really ancient industry. I think you could probably date the more modern form with the age of exploration and sort of like Prince Henry, the navigator in Portugal. And actually you really wanna tie that to the Mongol invasions. So the Islamic empire kind of separated Europe from the east and they traded a lot, but the Islamic empires were in between and they were the middle man and they marked everything up like 10x and made a lot of money became rich doing that. And during the Mongol invasion, the Mongols came and defeated the caliphate in Baghdad and opened it up. And that’s where you get like Marco Polo, right, traveling to the east and kind of saw the riches of Asia and Europe for the first time was trading. And that was about a hundred year window when it was open. And then it came kind of crashing back down. The iron curtain of the Islamic empire came back and Europe was like, wait a minute. We, like, we just saw, all those riches we wanna get in on these like cheap spices and all the other stuff, the silks and everything. And so it started with the Portuguese trying to find a way around Africa and they started, this is like the original kind of like technology industry. They had to build all kinds of astronomic instruments to be able to tell where you are. It was about, I want to say 1350 is when they really started that program. And 1498 is when they rounded the horn of Africa and made it into India. Now, it’s not all beautiful. Like obviously there’s terrible things that happen. Like the first thing they did was kill a whole bunch of people who were on their way to the Hajj Islamic pilgrimage. It’s easy to kind of see yourself in these people. Especially as like a European descent person like myself, I’m like, oh yeah, I came from these people, but they were like really superstitious, very different types of people. They saw themselves in a holy war against Islam it was really, like reverse jihad crusade from the beginning. But very quickly they set up trading centers and the spices were like 1/1000th of price or something like that. Maybe, maybe that’s a bit, but it was so much cheaper if you could go to the source and not just in India, but all the way to the Spice Islands, which is, I think, modern day, the Malukus or Indonesia. And so it suddenly became very, very rich. It was kind of the original venture capital that if you sent a ship to the Malukus and it made it back, you made like eight extra money and yeah, only half the people made it back, but you still got four extra money. You know, only half the ships made it back. So that’s kind of the origin. And I think where it really comes to the next level is in the, I want to say like one of the Dutch East India Companies, the first joint stock companies, or the first public company you could buy shares in was a shipping company, the Crown of the Netherlands and later England and France to the certain extent gave monopolies on trade and in exchange for, the crown would take 20%, but then if you wanted a trade with the east, only this one company could trade. And so that was like 1700s, 1800s the East India Company, but there’s terrible things, of course: trading slaves, trading opium was big, we don’t want to pretend like all of the trade was always great and you do need regulations and there’s good reasons to have like all the rules that we have around trade today, but yeah, it’s a fascinating industry and it’s like really cool to be part of that today. Probably the most important thing, I would argue that the most important technology of the last 50 years is the shipping container. At least in terms of like lifting people out of poverty and unifying the world, creating globalization and yet, it hasn’t really changed. We still unload these ships one container at a time. It’s just like, there’s not a lot of innovation and it makes sense because it’s hard to change an organization, an institution, a way of doing things. Tamara Winter: That actually sort of beautifully dovetails into what I wanted to ask you next. You know, most people tend to think of supply chains from a consumer point of view, right? So you know, earlier this week I ordered my favorite version of Clif Bars, this is a peanut butter banana one, and you know, I press some buttons on Amazon and it comes to me. So that’s the typical way people think about supply chains, but can you talk about how the supply chain affects the economy more broadly? Ryan Petersen: Well, it’s the circulatory system for the economy. The supply chain can be a lot of things. It’s also the manufacturing and things, the raw materials, there’s a great paper called I, Pencil. You know what I’m talking about? I, Pencil? Tamara Winter: I love I, Pencil. For anyone who’s not listening, the founder of FEE, the Foundation for Economic Education. It’s a great essay about trade, about how a pencil gets made called I, Pencil. Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, yeah. And it’s basically the idea that like, there’s no human being that understands how you make a pencil and you couldn’t possibly make something simple as a pencil because you have to understand, okay, what is it made of? It’s got wood. It’s got like maybe rubber, some graphite in the middle and some kind of aluminum rapper. It’s like, okay, to make that, you need to understand how to cut down trees. Okay. How do you cut down a tree? You need a saw, okay, now I need to know metallurgy. It’s like right away, you give up. There’s no one, you know, of course there’s some people who know metallurgy, but now to make rubber, okay. I need to know how to grow rubber trees, do the little thing where they cut the slit in it, you know, capture the rubber, process it. The same for aluminum, same for graphite. And then create, I have no idea how they put the graphite inside the wood, but they have to do that too. It’s like, there’s no one who could do all of that. And then imagine that on an insane complexity of the modern economy, where everything is connected to everything else, and we all take it for granted. And that fundamentally it’s the supply chain. How does this connect to one another? How do we connect companies, people and the ideas that go into those products, right? Adam Smith has a great quote, he’s like, “I never saw a dog exchange a bone with another dog.” It’s something that only humans do. And we depend on it to an insane degree. It’s what advances civilization and progress because every time two people trade with one another, there’s a mutually beneficial exchange. And so value is created from that process. I give you something that you value more than what you gave me, I think it’s a foundational aspect of like, how we rise up as a human civilization, as a, human you know, species. I think it’s actually one of the dangerous things in globalization, is you lose kind of some of the uniqueness of different cultures and different civilizations and being uniquely good at something. Probably the most important economist, if not the most famous, is David Ricardo explained how this value creation takes place when two people trade. But if everybody has the same ideas, then all you get is like, oh, we have slightly different geographic attributes, geologic attributes, you have coal and we have timber or something. It’s not, not that interesting when all the ideas are the same. And you lose some of that if there’s cultural monotone, like all the civilizations have the same ideas. It’s not very interesting. I love to travel and I think I used to like to travel even more because the internet has kind of created a lot of monoculture. You can get avocado toast anywhere you want on planet Earth now, it’s like a sign elites are traveling in the neighborhood. I hate seeing avocado toast when I’m in some foreign country. And you know, you want to live in a world where there’s like more cultural diversity and I think it can lead to more interesting exchange of ideas and exchange of products and things. Tamara Winter: There’s a great Verge article that I think about constantly called Welcome to Airspace. And it’s all about the Airbnbification of everything. The last time I was in Zambia, I just tweeted pictures. Like, where do you think I am right now? And I got like, oh, Miami, San Francisco. And I was like, nope, I am in Lusaka, Zambia. And it looks like I’m in Miami. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. I bet you can get avocado toast there. Tamara Winter: You actually can. And you know what? The avocado toast was some of the best avocado toast I’ve ever had, I’m still thinking about that avocado toast. Alright, I’m ready to talk about Flexport. What is the problem that Flexport was created to solve? Ryan Petersen: It’s fundamentally that it’s too hard to buy products in another country and import them into a different country, ship them around the world, clear them through customs, get them delivered, where they need to go. And this is for businesses, like helping a company solve this problem that they shouldn’t honestly have to have this big bureaucratic department pushing paper to do the things, it should be automatic like, companies need to be really good at two things: make an awesome product that’s high quality at scale that people want—very, very hard, almost a nightmare to do that in this world—and then even harder in my view is be differentiated, like build a brand, a customer connection, sell the product. So supply and demand, right? It’s like the core attributes of a business. And if they’re doing all this other stuff like compliance and spending time on paperwork and shipping and routing containers and tracking things like, it’s not really value added work. It should be an automatic kind of utility scale, just reliable thing that’s out there. And that’s what we, that’s what we’re building. Very, very hard problem, because if you wanna ship a single, let’s call it a pallet of goods. Tamara Winter: Yeah, I actually would love you to walk me through, you know, if I’m, if I’m the, you know, the Clif company, what actually does it take to ship this from wherever it was made now I’m kind of scared, to me in, in New York. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and so if you’re, if you’re making well, let’s say—I don’t know enough about Clif Bars, so I don’t wanna speak to, that specific company, but let’s say you’re making a pallet of some new, like cool hardware company, maybe these headphones right here. And you’re trying, they’re probably made in Shenzhen or thereabouts, in Southern China. And if you were to try to get those products made and shipped in a smaller batch, let’s take, because I want to show you it’s very normal to ship like a pallet of stuff. It should be even more normal than it is, except it’s really hard. But let’s say we’re shipping a pallet. So we’re talking about like one meter cubed of stuff that needs to ship around the world and it’s going to be—okay, how many companies are gonna be involved in this transaction? I’m shipping this from, let’s say Shenzhen to St. Louis. Alright, I’ve got a pallet of stuff and it’s going to go by ocean freight to save money—air freight’s pretty expensive. I’ve got the factory that’s gonna pick these up. So I’ve got to send a truck to pick it up, bring it to a warehouse where it’s gonna be consolidated with other customers’ cargo, put into a container. I’ve got to find a container somewhere. I’ve got to then get another truck that takes that container to the port. A customs brokerage needs to clear it out of the port, out of the country. I’m now at seven companies involved in this transaction and I haven’t left the home country yet. Seven different companies. Put it on a ship is eight, clear it through customs on the other side of the world, bring it to the port, 10 companies, another truck picks it up, brings it to a warehouse. That’s 12 companies. Another truck brings it to your final warehouse for wherever it’s destined. I’m not even like in the store yet. Oh. And by the way, there’s a bank that’s providing a payment on this transaction, maybe it’s Stripe. There’s a insurance company that’s going to underwrite in case something gets lost or damaged in the way. So I’ve got like 13, 15 companies, very normal thing to have that. Tamara Winter: And I don’t even have my headphones yet. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Your headphones haven’t got to the consumer, right. And so warehouse pick, pack and delivery. Fundamentally the problems come about because everybody in this chain is operating off of like a very local set of data of what can they see about the transaction. And yet they’re dependent on each other in a chain. Humans have to be involved in some of it. Compliance is at stake. You can’t just ship anything across international borders for good reasons. Counterfeit, drugs, arms, people, who knows what can be shipped, right? So you need these regulations. And so that’s the fundamental problem is how do we get data to the company that needs to do something, connect with that asset, with that truck, with that ship, if there’s an asset involved, show them what to do. They need data to do their job. And then they have to tell us what they’ve done and share data back. And that’s, that’s fundamentally, what’s different. We call this business a freight forwarder. That’s what we call this industry that solves this problem. Because if you’re a startup making headphones, you definitely don’t wanna be dealing with 15 companies every time you ship your pallet of headphones. So you call a freight forwarder and then a freight forwarder deals with the complexity. I often joke it should called freight email forwarding because they basically just like email everybody and make it happen. And you don’t have to deal with that. What Flexport does differently is build interfaces, web interface, mobile interface, increasingly it’s about APIs and connectivity to software talking to software so that, that data can flow to and from these parties and get visibility at what’s happening, control over what’s happening, to help smooth that transaction, make it cheaper, make it faster. Hopefully we can route around disruptions in supply chain. We can find you better routings and cheaper, faster, more options and make that process better. Tamara Winter: You have had an inside look, more so than most, into what part of the supply chain has broken down in the past couple of years, you know, there’s the like sort of evergreen headline in this, in these unprecedented times. What in the supply chain broke down? Can you just help me understand that? Ryan Petersen: A lot of things, I mean, I think fundamentally what’s happened is that consumers really shifted their buying patterns rapidly overnight. When we all locked down and stop going to restaurants, hotels, bars, travel, all these things that are in the, what we call services, massages, like stuff that you just stop doing, tended to be services and we all shifted our spend onto goods. Income didn’t fall that much. A lot of people were out of work, especially if you worked in the services businesses, but the government really printed a lot of money and did a lot of stimulus. So people had money, money burns a hole in your pocket, you’ve got to spend it you know, you’ve got to get your dopamine somewhere. So people just kept buying stuff on Amazon and elsewhere, e-commerce went crazy. So you had this big shift from services onto goods and with all those goods purchases that just put incredible stress on our supply chain, manufacturing companies and couldn’t keep up. And so a lot of things kept breaking down. On logistics, it’s a simpler story. We just didn’t have enough infrastructure, not enough containers, not enough chassis—these are the trailers that haul containers—not enough drivers for the trucks, not enough container ships, the ports that we have didn’t have enough throughput to keep up with all the excess volume. So like volume of containers is up 20% over pre-pandemic levels. Things started to break down just by just not being able to keep up with the demand. Tamara Winter: I’m thinking back to when my poor dad had to sit through me and Swan Lake. I mean, if one thing goes wrong, if the Nutcracker, you know, falls, everybody falls. And, and it sounds like that is kind of a, there’s a similar level of fragility in our supply chain, which I don’t know that most people appreciated, because again, there’s a pencil right here. All you can see is, you know, the pencil that gets to you. And a lot of that complexity is just kind of hidden. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. And markets work like for the most part and the price mechanisms respond. And you gotta be careful what if the price goes way up for ocean freight, which it has, it’s like up five x or so over pre pandemic levels, and there’s a lot of push right now, Congress is trying to bring it back down through regulations. We’ve got more talk about price controls than we’ve had, like in my lifetime right now. And it’s pretty dangerous because that high price is a signal to market participants. Hey, there’s money to be made. If you can bring a ship to market, if you can build a ship and that’s how markets are supposed to function. So you take out the price mechanism and you will not get more goods in response to the demand. And like, what we need is more supply, and that’s what prices are for. So when prices go up, I know a lot of government politicians, or it’s popular to say, oh, corporations are greedy, but like, maybe so, but the mechanism is price is high. Oh, wait, there’s opportunity here. And people surge onto that. And that’s, it’s amazing. It is a ballet like that. It all works. And it works because of the price mechanism basically. But it’s also amazing that it works given how screwed up humans are, like human nature is pretty screwed up. And like the fact that it all works is kind of a miracle. Like people have all, we’re kind of like beasts inside and have all these crazy emotions and terrible things, yet the economy mostly works and it’s, we can call it fragile, but it’s been relatively resilient. Tamara Winter: Tell me about some of the misconceptions that people have about global trade. You’ve become kind of a go-to expert, like what are the sort of things people just get wrong over and over again? Ryan Petersen: The idea that trade is exploitative, I think is a really interesting one. Like you have this whole fair trade movement, which I don’t quite get because trade is like mutually beneficial exchange or the idea that someone’s being exploited here, doesn’t really add up to me. I think you do need really good regulations on like externalities, like environmental damage and there’s great reason to have rules, like to protect environment, and labor safety standards and things like this, child labor and all that. But like, that’s not a trade. That’s just like good governance. The trade aspect of like one company exchanging something for money on the other side of the world, that’s like, that is the heartbeat of wealth creation, value creation, the engine of prosperity. And so to take it away, I’ve found to be really dangerous. That’s like one criticism. I think the valid criticisms that I’m very much like really interested in or the stuff I was getting to earlier on like global monoculture. Like if it’s the same product sold everywhere on planet Earth, the Earth becomes less interesting. And it’s maybe that’s like a privileged white guy thing to say, because like, I want to go to Zambia and experience like Zambian culture and like, show me what Zambia is like and make it different. Whereas Zambian people are like, look, we’re trying to be less poor. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: We want to have a life like you have. And who am I to say like, oh, you can’t, I don’t want you to benefit from like Western nice things. I want you to live with the way Zambains always lived in my mind. Tamara Winter: Look, I didn’t wanna say it, but I, you know, I was thinking it, but I’ll tell you what, next time I go back to Nkwashi, I’ll take you with me. You’ve touched on this a lot, but I wanna ask you explicitly, you know, there’s an inverse relationship between trade and poverty. And I’m hoping you can offer some sort of like more examples of this and expand on that point a little bit, because it’s one that I believe really strongly. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and well, we’ve seen it over the last 50 years. I think China’s probably the best place we can point to where we lifted 600 million people or so from below the poverty line, it’s really an economic miracle. But it’s not unique to China. Korea’s a great example. Export led growth in Korea. Dubai is a more modern example where liberalization and opening things up and allowing trade to take place. I think it’s well rounded in economic theory, which I’m skeptical of, but in empirical data, you can just look and see that the countries that trade more, become more prosperous. And it’s a little dangerous in my view, there is nothing that says that all progress is up and to the right, Like we kind of think so, because we feel like we’re in a golden age and the world’s never been richer. And the graph of GDP is just like this amazing exponential curve. Four percent annual growth, but if you do it for 500 years, you get like an insane exponential curve. But that does not have to be the case. And if you look across 10,000 years of human civilization, there are these waves of progress and then collapse. And we’re right now at a crossroads where trade has not been so unpopular in a long time, you’ve got trade wars between China and the United States. You’ve got pretty much both parties in the United States, no longer supporting a free trading agenda. You’ve got war as we speak unfolding in Ukraine, which has made trade and economic sanctions into a weapon. I’m not necessarily arguing you shouldn’t do this, but we should talk about the consequences. Russia and Ukraine combined are number one and number five in grain exports. And Belarus is I think number one in fertilizer exports in potash. Take Africa over the last 40 years, Africa’s made huge amounts of progress at five x the output of food in the continent per capita over the last 40-50 years. But a lot of that’s dependent on fertilizer imports. And so if you suddenly remove all these fertilizer imports and that’s going to be even for the food sufficient nations, all of a sudden they might not be. And a lot of countries take Egypt or many Middle Eastern countries are net food importers and they buy a lot of grain from Russia and Ukraine. And if that’s removed from the market, food insecurity is what leads to civil war, famine, anarchy, right. And we’re on some level, we’re going to find out just how important globalization and trade is because we’ve taken it for granted. We’ve become incredibly dependent on it. And if you suddenly rip that carpet out, it’s almost, it’s a pretty unfair to these countries who were sold a bag like, hey, you’ll be able to get goods from anywhere. It’s very scary. I’m very worried about it. Tamara Winter: It’s really interesting because there are, you know, the first order effects that I think even those, I don’t know that they’re very well understood. But the second order effects I think are really poorly understood. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and the second order effects, third order effects. I mean, it’s really anyone who thinks they could predict all of this. I have no idea, but very few people predicted, like realized that actually the governments really aren’t nearly as important as the people in the west and in the social media world, just reacting. And then every company feeling like, oh, we can’t do business in Russia anymore. Tamara Winter: Right? Like Coca-Cola. Ryan Petersen: Even if we’re allowed to legally, we just can’t, and backing off. And that probably was not part of the calculus of like, you know, we’re not, McDonald’s is not required to shut down all their stories, but they just did. Tamara Winter: It’s like interesting, you know, 30 years ago or whatever you see, like those incredible images of the first McDonald’s opening post-Iron Curtain falling. And now, you know, McDonald’s is like pulling out. It’s just, it’s really interesting and visceral. You talk often about cargo as capital. What does that mean when you talk about cargo as capital? Ryan Petersen: Well, just inventories is another form of dollars, the money has taken a different form for a period of time. I mean, that’s trade fundamentally is you’ve exchanged dollars for this other thing, which is a form of capital, working capital, inventory. I think many logistics companies and logistics companies that are buying logistics services, brands, the logistics department is not really thinking in these terms. This is classic, like finance teams think about this. Like they see it on the inventory and on the balance sheet, as you know, working capital, inventory is another line item there. But the logistics teams of the world have been trained, just like buy cheap freight as cheap as they can get the service to buy freight. They’re not really doing the math, which is not that sophisticated, but it takes one degree of sophistication more to realize that, hey, you know what, if you can ship that container 30% faster, then that’s 30% less inventory at any given moment sitting on the water, being unproductive, doing nothing useful. And so you should be willing. Now you can do the math. Are you willing to pay a premium for faster freight in order to get that cash back and reinvest it in your business in more interesting ways and put it to work? This is why, that’s one of the reasons why very high value products will ship by air. You don’t want something really, really valuable sitting on the ocean for a month. One, it might get damaged, but no, it’s more, it’s not valuable have a container load of iPhones. I’ve not done the math. Well, we could probably do the math pretty quickly. There would be probably 50,000 iPhones in a container, times a thousand bucks, each 50 million in an iPhone. I made this up. I have no idea, but I’m just doing it in my head, 50 million dollars. There’s better things Apple can do with 50 million bucks, like run some more ads and pay for air freight, which isn’t that expensive given the value of those products. So those will ship by air. There’s some degree of that, but the typical logistics team doesn’t think that way. And at Flexport, we try to get to, hey, can we help you be heroes, help you represent this data to your CFO so they can see the option like, oh, wow. I could, if I ship, if I pay a little bit more to ship it faster, I get the money back and improve my working capital situation. Tamara Winter: I want to talk about containerization, because I’ve asked you very little about that. You know, shipping containers are kind of, the heart of global trade and of the basic unit for measuring global trade. I want to know, is more generally better when it comes to containerization? Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well I think containers revolutionized trade. We probably reduced the cost of shipping things by like 95 to 99%, depending on the commodity. You see these old photographs, we have some in the Flexport office, like there’s this photographer who worked at the port of Oakland as a longshoreman and was also a photographer. And he took these beautiful pictures right at the dawn of the container era. So they have some containerization, but they also had these guys doing backbreaking work, like hauling sacks on their bag, loading the ships. And the way the ships were loaded was like, literally like tying rope to tie it all down and unbelievably laborious. And it would take a week or more to load a ship, which is not a good use of an asset. Like you’ve got to get this thing moving. It makes money when it sails. So containerization revolutionized the world and made trade possible, made it possible to buy things from around the world and find, you know, allow economic opportunity, jobs to be created and us to have cheap stuff as well. However, there’s been very little progress in that since the seventies when this took place. I don’t think the container itself needs to change form factor. It seems like basically correct. But the process by which they get loaded, unloaded from the ships, seems like there’s a lot of opportunity besides just like, pluck one container at a time off the ship. Like it would be fun to do a design contest where there’s some really creative types. Tamara Winter: Maybe you should. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, conveyor belt, like PEZ dispenser out the front. I don’t know. There’s got to be some better way to do that. Tamara Winter: There’s so much talk right now about the next World’s Fair. Like bringing or World’s Fair, reviving it. I don’t know. I would love to go and see container ships. I was eating at Mission Rock and we were just watching the container ships, just one by one come through and I, it would be really cool to see like a giant robot crane. Ryan Petersen: Well, the thing to watch is, is the crane up or down? Tamara Winter: What does it mean? Ryan Petersen: Well, if it’s up, it’s not working and just watch they’re, they’re not down that often. Tamara Winter: Tell me, speaking of throughput is the health of global trade, is it primarily about throughput? Ryan Petersen: Well from a logistics standpoint, yeah. It’s all about throughput, efficiency costs, you know, transaction costs. How do we lower the transaction costs to reduce the amount of error? Like most actual transaction costs, some of it comes from humans doing work, but I think at least within Flexport, most of the problems come about through bad quality, bad data rework, like having to redo the thing, getting the, when the data’s wrong, it can lead to, you know, a hundred x more cost. Like if you take a customs clearance, if you file with the right data, it might take you a minute to get the data organized correctly, like a minute of human labor and review the documents, we use machine learning to ingest the data off of, if it is a PDF or Excel file or something, but you still need a human to review it and validate it like for compliance reasons. So it might take you a minute. If the data’s wrong, it might take you two weeks of dealing with customs to sort it out and what went wrong. Tamara Winter: I guess I want to know and this might be intuitive to most people, but why is it so important to have uniform standards across countries on things like shipping container dimensions? I didn’t realize that that actually wasn’t standardized until very recently. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well, standards are crucially important for, I mean, the container’s an obvious one because if the container’s a different size, then you can’t have a standard size ship, crane, etcetera. If every container’s different, it just leads to chaos. And so that was actually created by the Federal Maritime Commission, which is a U.S. agency, created that standard. And then used that funding mechanism where if you wanted to build a ship, you basically got super cheap capital. As long as you adhered to the standard. You could build another kind of container ship, but why would you do that when like, this is the standard everyone’s using and it’s like free money if you build a ship like that. So that was one way to get a standard. It’s notoriously how hard to get everyone to agree on standards. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: Well, everyone has their own opinions and you have these very boring consortiums, like I’ve never been involved in the, what do you call the web? The, HTML standard setting body that sets CSS and all these things, I would go crazy. I might have an opinion, but I can’t sit through those meetings, which is dangerous because then the standards get set by like the most boring people possible who are willing to sit through such meetings, and actually it’s a very good example is that the, the 40 foot container was not the right standard necessarily. The companies that invented the shipping container where one was using a 24 foot container and one was using a 26 foot container and for their businesses, that was like more optimal for the size and volume of the stuff that they were shipping. And there’s nothing to say that 40 foot is the right amount. In fact, I would argue it’s definitely the wrong standard because for trucks in the United States, domestic trucks, 53 foot is the length of a standard semi truck, which is really silly because we should have 53 foot ocean containers because then on every single shipment you’d have about 30% more cargo per driver per asset move. Tamara Winter: Why is it 40? Ryan Petersen: It was just set that way. Tamara Winter: It was just arbitrary? Ryan Petersen: By the Federal Maritime Commission. I mean, I don’t know, I wasn’t in, in the meetings standard setting body. Tamara Winter: So maybe it’s your fault because you weren’t in the meetings. Ryan Petersen: Or like take the QWERTY keyboard. I mean, it’s notorious like not, it was set to slow you down rather than type fast. So that’s a bad standard, and yet standards are super valuable. If every keyboard was different, you could only use your own computer. I think optimizations are really important here. So for example, all the containers that we ship on average are only 70% full. Like we use, we digitize these packing lists and do the geometry of the cardboard boxes inside and see that they’re only 70% full, there’s 30% extra space right here. Okay, cool. Like you got 30% savings on carbon just by filling the container correctly. That’s not hard. So there are some easy, low hanging fruit, but fundamentally, how do you replace this? And it might be that this is one of the last holdouts where you continue to use fossil fuels, even as we go to electric fleets on cars or nuclear, hopefully nuclear power for the grid. Like you’re probably not gonna get people comfortable. There has been one nuclear power cargo ship in the history of the world, back in the sixties. I don’t think we’re ever going to go back there. Tamara Winter: What happened to it? Ryan Petersen: It got decommissioned. It went for a couple of years. It was like a super fast boat. But it pre-container era. And so when the containers came along, it was retired and I think it was also pre-Chernobyl when people freaked out about nuclear. Tamara Winter: It is so interesting to me, you know, my background, I went from Bethesda to San Francisco too, then to New York. But it was always really interesting to me to observe the way that technologists interact with government. There’s your sort of Stewart Brand style person who is sort of both very interested in government and very interested in technology, but there is, I think a perception that technologists today sort of hate the government and I wonder why it is so important to you and why you have sort of gone out of your way, really to work with governments basically at this point on every level. Ryan Petersen: Well it’s, our business is in clearing goods through U.S. customs. So we, you know, Flexport couldn’t exist until we got a license from the government to be able to do customs clearance and I had to go through FBI background checks, Department of Homeland Security, every customs broker does. So you know, that is our business is complying with government regulations and we don’t have a problem with the government regulations actually. I think there’s good reasons. Of course I can object to certain things. I think tariffs should be lower or have nuance and stuff like that. But like fundamentally governments have every right to control what goods flow into their country and there’s reasons, very good reasons to prevent drugs and certain kinds of weapons and yeah, illicit activity, counterfeits and stuff from crossing border. So the government plays an appropriate role and we’re happy to work with them constructively on that stuff. As a citizen, I am kind of like confused in San Francisco, why the tech community has been so disengaged with the government. I mean, like we have the board of supervisors is our version of the city council here in San Francisco. And it’s like really antagonistic to technology and to business. They just keep passing rules that are like really anti-business, new taxes, things that are just like, oh, they clearly don’t want us here. We should leave. And yet there’s 11 people on that board. I think probably seven of them are really anti-business and four more moderate and reasonably pro-business appreciate that we employ lots of people in the city and, and pay lots of taxes. So there’s seven seats and, you only need a majority or some form of majority, seven elections, each of which is decided by a couple hundred votes, We are home to some of the greatest technology platforms in the world with literally billions of users. Like we’ve managed to sign up a billion users from your website and you can’t get a hundred people to vote in an election. Like what is going on? Why are we so disengaged? I don’t have a good answer for it, I think you’ll probably start to see people wake up take action and like, look it’s, I believe deeply in democracy, but part of the democratic process is people like taking action and getting people getting out to vote. Tamara Winter: And, you know, as you look across whether it’s shipping, Flexport, what are you optimistic about? Ryan Petersen: Well, you know, it’s, you have to stay optimistic about the ability for individuals to make a difference. I found over and over again in life that if you just take some action, it has a quality of its own that, can pick up the phone and call someone and make something happen, send emails, make stuff happen, and the world just kind of responds. Most recently, like we had this concept on our executive team meetings. Tuesday after the war started, we’re like, hey, we should activate flexport.org on Ukrainian relief. Tamara Winter: For people who don’t know what is flexport.org? Ryan Petersen: Oh, that’s the impact arm of Flexport. We do logistics for humanitarian relief, disaster relief. It has two missions, one is carbon measurement and offsetting and mitigation and two is humanitarian relief. So this is our impact arm. Of course the executive team level we thought of, hey, let’s get flexport.org working on this. flexport.org had already been working on it for like three days. They had already lined up nonprofits and aid agencies and would take action. But we, what we said was, hey, let’s help them raise some money. I mean, there’s only so much that Flexport can do as one company to pay for very expensive humanitarian relief operations. So let’s reach out, texted a couple of people. Next thing I know Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis run this like GoFundMe campaign that’s as of this moment has raised 20 million bucks for us and for airbnb.org to house refugees, us to do logistics for refugee sites. It’s like four days, we did that. And not everyone has our brand and our resources and knows how to text Ashton Kutcher or whatever, but like, you can start on a smaller level and just take some action and help somebody. And especially when you try to help someone else is when the world tries to help you, help you help them. But next thing you know, it’s a virtuous cycle and we’ve seen that with flexport.org. In fact, that was part of the reason that we set it up in a way that we can take donations is it allows us to go out and ask people to get involved, like our customers. We get them to donate products. If we can find a product that our customers make that a refugee camp needs, that’s like, what we do is we match them and we pay for the logistics, or we’ll get a donor to pay for the logistics. But like, by getting that sense of community engagement, everybody’s asked to help. People love to help. Like they want give back, they want to find these opportunities. And so I’m so very optimistic of the power of kind of, I might call it naive optimism that like, believing that you can do something, even if it’s tiny and it has a power of its own to inspire other people to do that. We live in a messed up world, but I don’t think it’s more messed up than it’s been in the past. Like there’s always been wars, since the dawn of humanity, go read the books, like there’s been much worse wars as bad as it is to say, because we’ve never had an iPhone to watch this stuff firsthand the way we do right now. But wars have gone on since the dawn of men and that is not going to change because human nature is not going to change. There’s gonna be wars in the future. And yet humans also, I think if you were to go over right now to Poland, you would see people taking care of each other people housing refugees, people looking after families. And so the bright spot of humanity is not going to change either. And there’s a lot to be optimistic about for sure. It’s like kind of crazy to recognize we all do kind of have these superpowers. It takes a long time to compound so that the world’s given me more resources and connectivity and network to get stuff done, but I think we all have that superpower a bit. And the more you use it, the more it compounds, and becomes more powerful. Like I have a couple of friends who are I might call them like obsessive phone users on like the old school, like call people. And these people have superpowers that would, you would not believe. Like the willingness, I don’t have this, but if you had it, the willingness to make 20 to a hundred phone calls per day, if you make a hundred phone calls per day in 10 years, you’ll be a billionaire. I’m certain of it. One of them called me last night. We’re flying all these goods over to Ukraine and he’s trying to get me to fill the planes full of refugees coming back. And I’m like, that’s a great idea. They’re passenger planes. So there’s empty seats. We could do that, but they need visas to come into the United States. He’s like, yeah, you’re right. Okay. And he like patches me through and calls this like world famous venture capitalist while I’m on the line, gets him on the phone, is like, “Hey, can you help us get visas for refugees coming to the country?” He’s like, “I don’t know why you would think that I could help you with that. But like, let me see, I’ll email the government,” and like next thing, you know, like emailing senators and like I have no idea if that’ll happen or not, probably not, but like I’ve seen crazier plans work and it’s just like the willingness, energy to go try stuff, like make it work. And then you keep trying it and it compounds so, a bit like that. With my kind of port tour tweet or, you know, I’ve just been trying stuff like this for a long time and finding out like, oh wow. It can, like, you can actually have a big impact out there if you, if you’re willing to look stupid sometimes and just go for it. Tamara Winter: So that was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport. I don’t think there’s a lot more to say after that other than maybe we should all be making a few more phone calls? In the meantime, I hope you will join us for the next episode of Beneath the Surface. We’ll be looking at a type of infrastructure that has acutely felt the impacts of COVID-era supply chain disruptions: housing. We’ll travel to London and visit with a Haredi Jewish community that has fought to upzone their houses so they can have room for their large families.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Ben Southwood: It’s March the 15th. Half past one in the afternoon and I’m standing on a residential street in South Tottenham, which is in Haringey, a borough of North London. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood. He’s out on the streets of London to look at houses. Ben Southwood: So the buildings we have here are two-story terraced Victorian and Edwardian homes. I can see many of them have cornices under their eaves or bay windows, gables… Tamara Winter: And he’s looking at these houses here because many of them are beginning to change. Ben Southwood: This residential street’s not quite like every residential street in the country because in addition to its normal two-story Victorian terraced homes, there are additional extensions that have been put on many of these houses. They have been built directly upwards, completely in keeping with the existing Victorian facade. In fact, I’m standing directly opposite an extension going on right now. Tamara Winter: Victorian houses in the UK were built during the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901. People from across the country flocked to London just as the industrial revolution was picking up speed. From 1811 to 1851, the population of Greater London doubled, half of the country’s population called the city home. A lot of new housing was needed and fast. And today, many of these Victorian houses are still in use. But now, London faces a new housing crisis: unaffordable rents, overcrowded conditions, and the dream of home ownership drifting further away from the city’s young people. London isn’t alone here. A similar story is happening around the world in cities large and small. However, on that quiet residential street in South Tottenham, the story behind those extensions offers a lesson for those tackling the global housing crisis. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our previous episode, we looked at supply chains: the movement of materials and products from country to country and a delicate dance that makes up the global economy. Today, we’re looking at a component of infrastructure that by its very nature doesn’t move: housing. The issues around housing are diverse and wide ranging. Whether the locality in question is a small town or global metropolis, every place has its own unique challenges. Still, once you dig a little deeper, you start to see some common threads. In this episode, we’ll explore why housing prices have risen dramatically in so many places and how individual neighborhoods, like South Tottenham in London, can address these challenges. For most of human history, people lived in rural areas. But over the last two centuries, cities around the world have seen explosive growth. The UN estimates that 2007 was the first year that most people lived in urban areas and the urban population is expected to double by 2050. This means that cities are having to adapt in unprecedented ways. How do we deliver food and other goods? How do we move through and between cities? And where are all of these new urban dwellers going to live? Because right now, the increase in population is leading to a housing shortage. The supply of homes in most cities has not kept up with the demand, unless supply means prices naturally go up. Archived audio: Housing prices are continuing to surge across… Archived audio: We’ve seen house prices go up steadily by several thousand… Archived audio: Housing prices in Ireland rising by a hundred euro a day. Archived audio: Housing costs taking a bigger bite out of your paycheck and it doesn’t seem to be any relief in sight. Emily Hamilton: I would say that affordability in US cities is the biggest challenge right now. Tamara Winter: This is Emily Hamilton. She was at the top of my list of people I wanted to talk to for this episode on housing. Emily Hamilton: I’m a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Tamara Winter: She says the most relevant housing challenge across the country and really across the world is affordability. Emily Hamilton: Several decades ago, urban policy makers were much more concerned about having too many residents leaving cities and issues like vacancy and crime were much more relevant than affordability. But today, as cities have become job centers once again and are generally the location where the highest paying jobs in the US are located, it’s become much more of a question of how to make space for everyone who would like to live in cities and be able to access those job markets at prices that are affordable to them. And in many parts of the world, that holds true as well, particularly English speaking parts of the world, like the UK and Canada, are facing very similar affordability challenges to the US. Tamara Winter: I’ll admit that I’m a statistic on this trend as well. Since graduating from college in 2017, I’ve lived in some of the most expensive cities in the US: Washington DC, San Francisco, and now, New York. From 1980 to 2020, housing prices in the New York metropolitan area have gone up 700%, more than double wage growth during that same period. In other words, an apartment that sold for $200,000 in 1980 would’ve sold for $1.4 million in 2020. In San Francisco, house prices went up over 900%, and cities outside the US have seen equally dramatic numbers. Ireland saw prices rise by about 800% driven primarily by Dublin. Prices in Sydney, Australia were up almost 1,500%. And in London, the average home price in 1980 was about 25,000 pounds. In 2020, the average price was about 490,000 pounds, a nearly 2,000% increase. Ben Southwood: Well, the UK, and the UK isn’t alone here, has a shortage of housing around its most successful, big cities. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood, again. He’s currently an editor for the online magazine, Works in Progress, but he’s been studying housing for a long time. Ben Southwood: I worked in housing policy for much of the last five years, including at Create Streets, Policy Exchange, and the Adam Smith Institute. I’m obsessed with housing. In the morning, I wake up thinking, "How are we going to solve the housing problems in the UK today?" And I go to bed in the evening, also, still thinking about how are we going to solve the problems in the UK has with housing. And this shortage of housing has led to massive increases in the price of that housing either to buy or to rent and also big shortages and long waiting lists for government-provided housing. Tamara Winter: Ben is always thinking about unique solutions to the housing crisis. So when he came across a series of interesting building renovations happening in North London, he had to investigate. Ben Southwood: Most of the time in England, when you do upwards extensions on homes, those extensions look very different to the house underneath and often are very ugly. And often, therefore, neighbors oppose them very vociferously. However, this extension, interestingly, was identical to the building underneath. In fact, it looked as if they had cut off the roof, added an identical story, and then plopped the roof back on top again. Tamara Winter: So Ben did what any good researcher would do these days: he took the question to Twitter. Ben Southwood: A councilor from North London, that is someone who had been elected by the local residents to be on the council—council is just the standard form of local government in the UK—replied to our Twitter threads, telling us what happened. Tamara Winter: The councilor revealed that the people of this community had a particular need for these housing extensions because they were Haredi Jews. Archived audio: Two hundred boys and girls waved a greeting to England, land of the free, the advanced guard of the first 5,000 Jewish and non-Aryan child refugees from Germany will be provided with a temporary home here while arrangements are made for them to immigrate. Tamara Winter: Haredi Jews first established themselves in London in the 1920s. However, it was after the second World War that the area really started to take off as Jewish refugees fled the Holocaust. Haredi Jews tend to be stricter in their practice of Orthodox Judaism than their peers. They adhere to kosher diets, go to synagogue several times a day, and send their children to religious schools. They also observe Shabbat on Saturdays, meaning, they don’t drive or use electricity. All of these cultural factors mean that Haredi Jewish people tend to live in tight knit and compact communities. One area they settled in was Stamford Hill. It’s in a borough of Hackney in North London. Today, it is the largest strictly Orthodox Jewish community in all of Europe. Add to that, the large size of Haredi families and the result has been overcrowded housing conditions. So yet another neighborhood in North London sprung up as a hub for the Haredi community, South Tottenham in the borough of Haringey. By one estimate, the number of Haredi families has increased fivefold in the last several decades. That’s where Ben found himself, investigating housing extensions. Ben Southwood: Hi there. I’m standing in South Tottenham, which is a neighborhood in North London looking around a suburban street. I have two-story Victorian homes. It’s quite quiet. I can see a few people walking down every few minutes. I can see lots of people walking around in Orthodox Jewish clothing. And I’m just about to meet my friend, Mark, at his house. Tamara Winter: I talked with Ben after his trip to hear more about what he learned. Ben Southwood: The local community is Haredi Jewish. Most of them are also Hasidic, which means they have particular ways of dressing, and particular religious rights, and so on. And I met with three leaders in the Haredi community in North London: Mark Groskopf, Shmuel Davidson, and Motty Pinter. Mark Groskopf: My name is Mark Groskopf and I’m from the Jewish Tottenham community. Ben Southwood: Mark is a family man with nine children, one of whom has left the house. Shmuel Davidson: I’m Shmuel Davidson. I’m from the Tottenham Jewish association. I’m also a deputy on the board of deputies and being a community activist here in the area, where I’ve lived all my life. And I thrive to build this area. Ben Southwood: Shmuel is a man who’s very much in demand. During our interview, he had to leave to take phone calls about five times constantly responding to community’s desires and needs. Motty Pinter: My name is Motty Pinter. I work for Chinuch UK, which is the representative body for 80 Haredi schools across the country. I also work for Agudas Israel Housing Association. Ben Southwood: Motty is the extremely energetic leader of the Hackney community. Motty Pinter: We liaise with the council and we do a lot of work with the council. So any issues, they’ll come in to try to understand the Jewish community and see what the needs are. Ben Southwood: This community has lots of kids on average. One of the stats said their average number of children was six. Motty Pinter: In Hackney, 8.1% of the population is Haredi. But when you look at the children population, you have 25.9% of the children population in Hackney is Haredi. When you drill that down to two to five-year-olds, you have over 30% of children, which are Haredi now. So what you figure is how many households. Ben Southwood: So all of these families having six children, the houses just weren’t built for them. Most communities, if they get overcrowded, decide to move out to the suburbs where land is cheaper, rather than staying in central London where land is more expensive. However, the Haredi Jewish community were not willing to do this because all of their cultural amenities are in one place. Shmuel Davidson: I can’t just move randomly to another borough where I don’t have a synagogue, I don’t have a kosher shop, I don’t have schools. My daily life is going synagogue. It’s just part of my daily routine. We pray three times a day. Going to the synagogue is just what we do. We can’t just move random everywhere. We don’t have a synagogue. It’s not, we just don’t have a life. My whole life, my whole family life will just be completely not there. Take for example, weekend Shabbat, I don’t use public transport. We have to walk. So I need a synagogue within walking distance. I need kosher food. I can’t just go to the local grocery store and find food there. There’s no kosher food there. I need to be able to go shopping on a daily basis. I need a bakery. I need a kosher bakery. I need a butcher. I need a kosher butcher. I need a school for my children. My children could go to non-Jewish school, however, culturally inappropriate. Yes, they will be educated nationally, the proper way, as education goes, however, the cultural appropriate education, the religious education, they will not get and they won’t feel comfortable there. I won’t feel comfortable. Shmuel Davidson: This is part of my daily life, my daily infrastructure. So we need to be living in an area where we have the community infrastructure, the synagogues, the shops, the schools, everything we need as a community and live our lives. Ben Southwood: So all of these things make it very difficult for the Haredi community to spread out. They need to be near one another and they have a very vibrant cultural life as well, which is another reason why they would like to be near, with one another as well. All of these things meant they weren’t willing to move out. So instead of moving out, the Haredi Jewish community decided, "Well, should we buy more of the houses in the neighborhood and spread out in each direction?" Well, firstly, it’s very expensive. It might cost them 500,000 pounds to buy the next door neighbor’s house. Secondly, that takes houses off the market and that means other people can’t live there. And finally, there just aren’t enough houses to go round. Tamara Winter: The housing challenges the Haredi community face are just one example. Any neighborhood can grow beyond its limits because of high birth rates, increased immigration, or simply because it’s a newly desirable place to live, but the Haredi community represents this perfect storm of housing crisis. They have on average eight people in their families. They need to be within walking distance of certain shops and community services, making it really hard to relocate. And the area where they live is way too expensive to buy any neighboring homes. If they can work their way through a housing crisis, shouldn’t it be doable anywhere? Stuck in the situation where they needed more space, some Haredi families decided to just start modifying their homes. But because of housing regulations in the UK, that’s easier said than done. Ben explains. Ben Southwood: So in the UK, we have something called planning, which is what Americans call zoning. But the difference between planning and zoning is that zoning is usually rules-based, so there are a bunch of rules that say what you can build and where, and then developers have to follow those rules. Planning in the UK is discretion-based, so every individual house, if you want to extend that house by adding a story or putting a different window on it or something like that, you have to apply to the local government and say, "Please, can I do this?" There are almost no developments that you can do without a specific permit with the council, which is the local government, going through the details of that permit, and councils look through every application bit by bit. And so it makes it very uncertain, very costly to pursue development because it’s uncertain whether you’re going to get permission or not. Some of them were building up in the maximum way they were allowed under the current rules or even pushing the rules to the limit. Building ugly box dormers is what they call them: boxes. And neighbors were objecting to these because they were unsightly and they were ruining the original heritage of the Victorian buildings, but they needed the space. So there was this conundrum where they wanted space, but the existing ways of delivering space were insufficient and ugly. Tamara Winter: Here’s Shmuel Davidson. Shmuel Davidson: There was no basic guidelines on what the rights, what the wrongs were. People were trying all sorts of things and it was just causing all sorts of problems for planning, enforcement, and it was just getting nowhere. And it got to the point where the community and the local authority really became heads up together and the whole thing. Ben Southwood: So they petitioned the council and said, "Look, can we build upwards?" Tamara Winter: Mark Groskopf again. Mark Groskopf: And Shmuel and I was going backwards and forwards saying, "Look, let’s come up with a solution." And it was actually after sitting, going backwards and forward, they turned their around and said, "Look, you know what? These actual lofts are ugly. Let’s come up with a new plan." We want a space, they wanted looks. Ben Southwood: Working with the council, the community came up with the idea of extending the buildings upwards in a way that was consistent with their existing style so that the street looked like it had just been originally built as a Victorian three-story street. Basically, you take off the roof, you add in an extra story that looks just like the one underneath and then you put the roof back on. So it just looks like the original building, but stretched upwards. It can get four or five in some cases, six bedrooms added on top. Tamara Winter: And over the years, the community began to make some progress working with the local council. Here’s Motty Pinter. Motty Pinter: They would put forward the most recent update, people would be able to argue over it or say their opinions. They would put things down on the table and say, "These are ideas that the architects have raised." And then people around the room would be able to say, "Yeah, but this won’t work here or it will work here." Tamara Winter: The council in Haringey was surprisingly open to the Haredi community’s ideas, but there was still some opposition. Motty Pinter: We heard different views from different people. Some of those have been extremely challenging. For some people, they see this as something new and they’re concerned how it’s going to look and how it’s going to end up. Shmuel Davidson: In this area, we had actually people, residents who worked silently against it. However, once we came about the design, with the concept, with the idea, working endlessly with the local authority, with both the politicians and the officers, together with community. And with the product we were going to deliver, I think all around, the opponents, very nice, but they saw the benefits just outweighed the opponents a million times. Ben Southwood: It still took years and years of work from the community to get the design code put through and make it so that if they made a planning application to the council, the council was very likely to say, "Yes, as long as it stayed within the rules they had set out in advance." Motty Pinter: I think once this is actually introduced and it’s introduced more widely, I think a lot of those fears won’t be there anymore. I think it’s just people being concerned about what is going to happen, but when it actually happens, they’re going to see a lot of benefit. Shmuel Davidson: When I grew up here, the concept of building extensions, those days was virtually nonexistent. And I see families today who have built like what we’re standing in front of now, which… Ben Southwood: There’s one going on right now as we speak. Shmuel Davidson: Right. I was going to say that it’s going up right now, which has just made a complete life changer, a life changer to the area, a life changer to the families. The design, it just fits into a beautifully Victorian side of the houses. It doesn’t look odd. It doesn’t stand out. The quality gives to the family, to the people. And if you just go around the area, just see the development, which has gone on here, which has been achieved by this magnificent idea, which I think we’re unique for the country, I think. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Shmuel Davidson: And it’s absolutely amazing. I just hope others will just copy us and do that because as there’s a housing crisis generally across everywhere, and we know there’s just no housing. Our achievement was the product which we have, which we see today. And this is a phenomenal product and it’s a product of community coalition, a product of working with the local politicians, a product working with the local offices, a product working with local residents, consultations, perseverance, nonstop, and knowing where your end goal is going to be and really go for it. Never drop out, never give up. Because eventually, if that’s what you want to get achieved, I want to get there, you’ll get there. Tamara Winter: What Mark, Shmuel, Motty and the rest of the Haredi community were able to make happen in South Tottenham is ultimately a success story. And the numbers would suggest that this success should be replicable. Haredi families have, on average, around six children. The birth rate in England and Wales in 2020 was 1.58 children per woman, a much smaller number. So if the Haredi community can create abundant housing with such a high population growth rate, certainly, it could be done across the larger UK population. But remember that it didn’t just magically happen, it took perseverance and patience, and working within the system to make progress. But why can’t the system be more accommodating to encourage more housing in the first place? Why does it take so much effort to build housing, something that London desperately needs? John Myers: What we see if we look at traditional zoning in places like England is that they were never designed to streamline that sort of process. They were never designed to solve those political challenges. I mean, zoning was essentially designed to stop change in many places. Tamara Winter: This is John Myers. He’s working at the forefront of pushing for housing reform in the UK. John Myers: We shouldn’t be surprised that we’re not getting plentiful housing in areas with zoning, because it was never designed to allow the densification that we used to see historically over centuries in cities, and which led to much loved urbanism that you see in historic housing cities in Europe today. Tamara Winter: His work goes back to 2014. John read an article that made him realize just how upside down the housing market truly was. John Myers: It explained that the total market price of housing in the UK was three times more than what it would cost to rebuild all of that housing at today’s prices from scratch. And so that to me was the biggest distortion I’ve ever seen in any market or industry anywhere. It’s just an eye watering shortage. And it tells you that there’s something really wrong there. It means that the reason why housing is so expensive in London is not because there’s some shortage of land or because we have a brick shortage, it’s because you’re simply not allowed to build more even when it would be enormously economically beneficial to do so. And that was just the most broken thing I’ve ever seen. Tamara Winter: John’s organization is called YIMBY Alliance, which stands for: Yes, in My Backyard. It’s a counter to NIMBY or Not in My Backyard. The NIMBY acronym was born from neighborhoods that didn’t want the downsides of new housing near them. Understandably, there are plenty of reasons to not want certain projects in your neighborhood. After all, who wants to live next to a coal power plant or a garbage dump? But when it comes to building housing, the effects are generally felt very locally: things like construction noise and additional traffic. And so the idea behind John’s YIMBY movement is that the collective economic and social benefits of allowing new developments will outweigh any short-term side effects. And John’s proposal is to leave the decision to build denser housing to the people who live on the street, where the housing will actually be built. It’s a proposal he calls ‘street votes.’ John Myers: If somebody turns a single family home on your street into say townhouses or into low rise, apartment blocks, that mainly only affects the other people on your street, especially if effects on parking and other traffic congestion are controlled carefully. So there’s no real reason why, if the broad majority, the overwhelming majority of people on your street, are happy for those sorts of developments to happen to gracefully allow single family homes to be turned into townhouses or even something a bit more ambitious. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be able to choose to allow that so long as the neighbors on other streets are protected. Tamara Winter: Street votes certainly sounds like a winning scenario for neighborhoods with each individual voter deciding for themselves if they’d like to capture the benefits of new developments. But of course, it’s not always easy for entire neighborhoods to come together. In South Tottenham, for example, the neighbors were opposed to changing the aesthetic of the old homes there. They ultimately found a solution, but surely, looks can’t be the only thing holding back new housing. Is there more behind this resistance to change? Tamara Winter: Thank you. I think we’re good. Yeah? Ronan Lyons: Yep. And my phone has just gone... yeah, no, it’s still working away there. Tamara Winter: Hello! Yes, I’m so excited about this. I got in touch with Ronan Lyons. Ronan Lyons: My name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin. Tamara Winter: Ronan is a bit of a housing guru in Ireland. Ronan Lyons: People in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the daft reports. Daft is like Zillow or the Right Move in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal. Once a quarter or twice a quarter, one for rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: In Ireland, we see the same story playing out as in so many other countries. Ronan Lyons: In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many... especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. Tamara Winter: It turns out, the history of these rules are part of the reason it’s so hard to change housing policy. Ronan Lyons: What had happened between the ’40s and the ’70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate. What it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country, now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. That was kind of a key turning point. Because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever, and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet. Tamara Winter: And so when politicians are trying to appeal to voters, anything that will affect the value of their homes can get politically dicey. Ronan Lyons: When they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get the elected to do so. People who come along, they won’t phrase it like this, "I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes." That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way, you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "And I’m going to price that new households." That’s a vote winner. If you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who are there already and secured their housing, have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: Despite this individual opposition, the benefits of growth and new housing are widespread throughout society. There’s better investment in infrastructure, attracting new businesses, creating more jobs. And of course, keeping house prices affordable. And with John Myers’ street votes plan, he believes that there will be enough people who see through the short-term to the larger upside. And he’s hopeful because he’s seen this localized effort work outside the UK. First, in Israel. John Myers: The most recent example that comes to mind is in Tel Aviv where the government proposed the means for residents to be allowed to decide if they wanted to redevelop their own apartment block, either extend it or to replace it with an entire new block with more apartments in it. That accounted for about 35% of the new homes in Tel Aviv in 2020. It’s an astonishing increase. Tamara Winter: Second, in South Korea in the 1990s. John Myers: The government allowed areas of single story homes to vote collectively if they wanted to give themselves permission to redevelop that whole area. And again, that accounted for the majority, I think, of the new condos built in Seoul for a portion of the 1990s. Tamara Winter: Lastly, a city in my home state: Houston, Texas John Myers: Houston, as you know, doesn’t have zoning in the traditional sense of the term, but it does have what are called minimum lot size requirements. And that says that if you want to build a new home, you have to have a piece of land which is at least a certain size. Those sizes were quite big. And the city of Houston wanted to reduce that size to allow more homes to be built in Houston, to keep Houston affordable for renters. There was a fair amount of political resistance from people living in areas of single family homes with large lot areas. And so in order to overcome that pushback, they decided to allow effectively an opt-out from the change that they were proposing and that let them get that change through, and you see the results in Houston where there’s a lot of new housing being constructed as a result of that. There are a lot of homeowners who are probably better off because their plot can now be used for more housing than it was before. And yet, the people who are most resistant to change have been able to opt out. And so this principle of giving flexibility on a very small level can make it much more politically palatable to engineer change and to get more housing. If you offer families a way to literally change their lives, the way to guarantee housing for their children or their grandchildren, a way to make it much easier to live, and all they have to do is vote for graceful change, which is completely consistent with what we’ve seen in cities over centuries, I have to believe that a small amount of people will do that. And that’s very consistent with what we’ve seen in Tel Aviv. It’s consistent with what happened in Seoul. And it’s also consistent with the fact that most of Houston didn’t opt out of these changes. Tamara Winter: And as John points out, the needle doesn’t have to move that much to see real change. John Myers: We don’t actually need to upzone the entire London or the entire of the Bay Area in order to get vastly amounts, more housing. So in London, if you just took 3, 4, 5% of the lowest density areas, you would engineer a step change. You would more than double the supply of housing in London. Tamara Winter: With all of these examples, John feels optimistic that street votes can gain some real political momentum in the UK. John Myers: We’ve seen quite a fair amount of traction in England with that. We’ve been lucky enough to find an incredible coalition that has supported these sorts of ideas, because it’s ultimately not very controversial. There aren’t really that many people who disagree with the proposition. But if the people on the street want to see more development, they should be allowed to permit it. Motty Pinter: I want to put it on pause for a second? Ben Southwood: That’s okay. But it’s fine to get extra… Motty Pinter: I have a tendency to talk too much. You don’t stop me, then.. Tamara Winter: Finally, back in South Tottenham, Ben wrapped up his interview with Mark, Shmuel, and Motty. By one estimate, the Haredi community has added a thousand extra bedrooms using their method of building extensions. Ben Southwood: Okay. So let’s have a little look around. Tamara Winter: And Mark himself had recently constructed a loft conversion onto his own Victorian house. Mark Groskopf: It was built about six months ago. So I was living in a bedroom, seven kids living in one bedroom, three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. Ben Southwood: Wow. Mark Groskopf: That’s how the family was living. Tamara Winter: So before Ben left, Mark gave him a tour of the house. Mark Groskopf: You’ve come into the hallway, you’ve got a dining room. So it’s quite a big dining room which we’ll extend it slightly. And then… Ben Southwood: Mark has a very large dining room, presumably to fit his nine children, wife, and self in having dinner at the same time. Mark Groskopf: Let’s go upstairs. Ben Southwood: And we go upstairs and Mark shows me what the house originally looked like. There were two bedrooms and two bathrooms. In one of the bedrooms was the master bedroom and the other bedroom was seven of his children. Mark Groskopf: This is where we had three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. We got two bunk beds. Ben Southwood: Now, there’s only two children in that original seven-children bedroom. And the other children are all spread across different bedrooms. Mark Groskopf: And we got another floor. Ben Southwood: And he’s added four bedrooms on the top floor. Mark Groskopf: And then you’ve got a front room over here, as you can see how big it is. Ben Southwood: Wow. Imagine. So you were going from that room where there were six of them in there. Mark Groskopf: Yeah. Ben Southwood: And then now, they’ve got a huge two-bedroom. Mark Groskopf: That’s correct. Ben Southwood: He says that this has made a huge difference to his children’s experience of school, to the togetherness, everyone’s getting along better. It really is striking how one-and-a-half extra stories can make such a large difference to how much space there is to go around when there’s seven children’s crammed into one bedroom, it must be much harder to have lots of the things that you want as a child. Mark Groskopf: And then we go up to the next floor. And what I’ve done is in this area over here, where the front of the house goes alone, we call it the apex. We’ve left over there and it’s a center room. We use it as a center room. Ben Southwood: Ah. Mark Groskopf: So you’ve got the toys down over there. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Mark Groskopf: And then the kids go inside over there and relax and enjoy themselves over there. Ben Southwood: Mark’s family looks after kids with special needs from the community. Mark Groskopf: Every weekend, we bring kids in from the other families to give the parents a rest… Ben Southwood: In the low ceiling part, he put in a sensory room with interesting lights and sounds and so on for kids to go in. And apparently, they really like it. Wow. Well, my mother would love to meet you then because she does a lot of work. It’s amazing how much they’ve managed to add how many... they’ve got extra bedrooms. They make all the space, they’ve got extra bathrooms, and this is all just on the existing plot.

Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to last week’s episode of this podcast, you heard excerpts from my interview with Dr. Ronan Lyons. He’s an associate professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and the director of Trinity Research and Social Sciences, an interdisciplinary research initiative that brings together scholars from across the university. In our conversation, he offers insights into the complexities of housing broadly and explains why the challenges plaguing housing markets are especially acute in Ireland. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dr. Ronan Lyons. Tamara Winter: Hello. Yes, I’m so excited about this. Okay. So the first thing I’m just going to have you do is introduce yourself and your academic affiliations, if you will. Ronan Lyons: Sure. So my name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in economics at Trinity College Dublin, where I’m also the director of a center called Trinity Research and Social Sciences which is like a collection of a few hundred research active social scientists across all disciplines in the social sciences here in Trinity and people in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the Daft Reports. Daft.ie is like the Zillow or the Rightmove in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal and once a quarter or twice a quarter, once for a rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: So Ronan, well, that’s actually really helpful. I’m curious about your journey into housing. How did that become a topic of interest for you? And I’m also curious, if I may, about your personal housing situation, because you have...it’s three children, is that right? Ronan Lyons: That’s right. Three boys, six and under, so a busy household. So I actually studied as an undergrad at Trinity and I did economics and political science. And afterwards, as many people find themselves, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do and I was in the lucky position that I was offered a scholarship to stay at Trinity. And I did some research in economic history, the history of trade and globalization, which I found really interesting, but then you’re like, "Well, I’ve picked one thing and I fall into one thing, what else do I want to do?" So I worked in policy making for a while. I worked for the National Competitiveness Council in Ireland. So Ireland as a small open economy is really dependent on its ability to trade internationally. So the Competitiveness Council advises the prime minister and the cabinet on where Ireland is doing well or badly. So that gave me a, I suppose, a taste of policy analysis, policy advice, and policy making and how policy happens. And at the same time, a friend of mine had set up daft.ie, the Irish property portal when he was in high school. And after I finished my degree, he came to me and he said, "Could we do a report where we look at the...just the rental sector in Ireland and how it’s performing?" Because there weren’t...it wasn’t the same, I suppose, measurement of housing market conditions at the time. So I accidentally ended up in housing but after working in...I was doing this as a side gig and I was working for the Competitiveness Council and I did a bit of work for IBM as part of their policy consulting. And I was moving around. So I had done research, I’d done policy making, I did private sector, but I realized that actually the thing I really enjoyed was research. So I had gone wandering around, but I came full circle. And in some ways you have to do that, right? You have to go and, or somebody like me has to do that. I need to know what I’m not doing to know that I’ve made the right choice, but in 2009, then I started at Oxford, a doctorate there looking at the Irish housing bubble and crash. And I finished 2013 and I was lucky enough that Trinity was hiring at the time. So I started in the department of economics then and I’ve kept those economic history or long run economic development as one hat and housing is another hat. And I see them as related because when you look at housing and you look at real estate, if you think about the immobility of a home or a building, when you buy it, you’re buying the opportunity associated with the location. And unlike a worker can move and financial capital can move and some workers are more or less mobile, that’s certainly true, but a dwelling isn’t. So the idea of using housing and using land to tell us something about what is good or bad about a location or what people are more or less confident about for me, that’s the heart of why real estate and why housing is really interesting in addition to the very obvious thing that we all need somewhere to live, right? And if...as we’ll presumably get onto, if we don’t have enough places to live, then all sorts of problems arise from that. Tamara Winter: That’s actually exactly the next question. It’s so funny as we’ve done some of these interviews, one of the producers are working with was like, "Tammy, I think you take for granted the idea that people just know what’s going on with housing, what the problem even is, if there is one." So I might actually ask you that question as, and maybe you can both couch it in Ireland, this is very much an issue across the world. What is the basic challenge with housing right now? Whether it’s affordability, not having enough homes, et cetera. Can you explain it to me like I’m five? Ronan Lyons: I’ll do my best. And I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many, especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. And some of that is population growth. And Ireland is I think, unusual in Europe in that it will have faster population growth this century than last century. And some of that’s the long shadow of, there was a famine in the 1840s and that’s why there’s such a large Irish-American community and there’s also a large Irish community in Britain as well. And that has those deep historical roots, but since the 1980s and 1990s, Ireland has had a successful business model where it’s a gateway to the single European market. And as a result of that, it has had all sorts of growing pains. As in incomes have gone up, population has gone up, Ireland has gone from net emigration to net immigration and all of those are signs of success, but unless you scale up the infrastructure as well, then you will come up with all sorts of congestion challenges. And the timing was fortuitous for things like road infrastructure, the European Union gave Ireland money to help build a motorway network. It didn’t have any highways 30 years ago, but in relation to housing, that’s a much more local issue and like many places, we have for various reasons, many of which are worthy, made it more difficult to build a home. So in addition to the population angle, we also have something that’s common in other countries as well but I think Ireland is particularly acute in this, changing demographics. So if you think of countries on a journey from having households of four or five persons on average to households having one or two persons on average, and some cases, maybe three, but you see, average household size is going from four to two, even with the same population, you need twice as many homes, but the homes are different. And on top of that, if you go from rural to urban in the same a hundred year transition, you are going from larger rural homes to smaller urban homes. And that’s a challenge of location and it’s a challenge of mix, but it’s also a challenge of viability because not everything scales down, you need plumbing, you need a bathroom and a shower and a toilet and a kitchen, regardless of how many people you have in the home. You need some basic infrastructure in there. So providing a home for one person is not a quarter of the cost of providing one home for four people. And I think that’s a big challenge that Ireland has struggled with and I think other countries struggled with as well, it’s perhaps less obvious than the population increase bit but certainly in Ireland’s case, providing urban housing for smaller households is not something the country is good at and it’s even a struggle to get politicians and policy makers to recognize the scale of that need. Tamara Winter: Could you explain basically what happens when the housing stock doesn’t match population growth or immigration? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So actually part of my doctorate, one of the main chapters was trying to come up with what you might think of as a house price equation. What happens, house prices or housing prices if income goes up, if supply goes up, if credit conditions get tighter or looser, and the credit conditions bit was super important at the time, because Ireland was coming out of a bubble and crash situation. So that was the focus at the time was how much, if nothing else changes and you loosen credit conditions, what happens property prices and sure enough, they go up and tightening them brings them back down again. And a lot of macro credential rules are about trying to level that out, take that channel for amplifying house prices up and down and just really calm it down. So that then leaves you once you at least try and contain those credit conditions, then it leaves you with this battle between supply and fundamental demand rather than credit demand or assets, factors like that. And on the fundamental demand side, you’ve got income per household and you’ve got household size. And those two things in Ireland’s case have been in...household size been going down, right? So you need more households per population or more dwellings per population and incomes have been going up. And this is another tricky bit for policy makers, the richer you get, the more you consume of everything, some things you shift into and some things you shift out of, but you consume on balance more of everything, the richer you get and that includes housing. And going back to that piece of research I did for my thesis, one of the things we were trying to do was take out that bit and say, "Okay, if you hold income constant then you increase supply by 10%, what happens?" And our best estimate was that if you did that exercise, you would lower prices by about 12%. And that’s a fundamental that, again, in many countries, people are questioning, right? Because they see completions going up, more new homes getting built and they see prices of rents going up and they go, "You can’t say to me that if you build more homes, prices will go down because that’s not happening at the moment." And really this gets to the heart of the social science of housing is that that correlation is not about causation, that what’s actually happening here is that homes are getting built because there’s a lot of need. And in Ireland’s case, there’s a need for maybe 40 to 50,000 homes a year and it’s only building 20,000. Now, if you didn’t build those 20,000, rents and sale prices would increase even more. And that’s the tricky bit because it’s very hard to argue with someone who doesn’t, who sees the correlation and doesn’t believe the underlying theory. It’s hard to say to them, "Well, let’s stop building and let’s see how that goes," right? That’s not a viable suggestion because that would make things worse, not better. Tamara Winter: The conversation about housing tends to be so polarized, especially online, but we’re talking about people’s livelihoods, right? I’m Nigerian, my parents immigrated to the US when I was about two months old and thank goodness they found a house in Texas where we grew up but say they had moved to New York, I think the situation would be very different or in Ireland where my grandfather worked for a substantial part of his career. Anyway, I digress. We know that house prices increasing is one of the obvious effects of restricting the supply of housing for whatever reason. But I wonder too, if you could just talk about some of the less well understood effects of restricting the supply of housing. Ronan Lyons: I mean, Ireland’s a good example of...I mean, it’s hidden and people don’t talk about it that much, but I mentioned earlier, Ireland’s really dependent on international investment or at least outwardly focused. Some of it’s indigenous and some of it’s coming from overseas, but it’s about creating economic activity for exports, right? You’re tapping into the European market. But over the last few years, the housing has been so scarce that firms have been holding back on expanding. I mean, think about how wrong that is, right? That you actually could hire an extra 2,000 people and you’re choosing not to, not because you can’t find work for them, but you can’t find housing for them. I’m not saying everywhere suffers from that, but there are, I think lots of places. If you look at New York and Tokyo over the last 50, 60 years, New York and Tokyo are roughly the same size, they have now...since the 60s, they’ve had very different setups in terms of the ability to build new housing. Tokyo is now about twice as big as New York. And people will say, "Well, New York’s big enough already. It doesn’t need to get any bigger," but the point is, and you talk to say the economic geographers, people like Enrico Moretti or whatever, and it’s the geography of where people are productive. And there are certain features about locations that make them productive and that would allow people to choose themselves if they want to move from say one part of the US to another, in order to move into a growing industry. And if housing is stopping that either internally in the US or internationally in the case of Ireland, that’s a real direct cost. I mean, housing is always in everywhere, right? Someone’s shelter, right? It’s their home at nighttime, but housing is seeping into being about livelihoods as well. And whether we are enabling people to have the most fulfilled potential that they can, that if we’re not getting housing, right? That’s for me, one of the...it’s not hidden, but it’s maybe not always highlighted, the cost of not enough housing, but it does seep through everywhere. If you don’t have enough housing... I wow my undergrads with the story that say 20 years ago, I had friends who moved out of their parents’ home in Dublin to rent a property in Dublin while they were in college, because they were just like, "Well, hey, I’m an adult, I’ll go off and I’ll find somewhere to live." That is so far from the possibility now, if you’re a 19 year old student in Dublin, I mean, you just stay at home with your parents. There’s no option. You may even have to commute. If you’re outside Dublin, you may be commuting an hour and a half every way, very early in the morning and very late at night to go to college. And that has a cost too, in terms of all sorts of things that are forgone that I took for granted when I was an undergrad that today’s undergrads can’t do. And I think they’re hidden costs as well in terms of forming people and their opportunities, because those years say between 20 and 25 are so crucial to people who are, say, in the higher education space. They’re so crucial to what happens afterwards. Everything is path dependent. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. I really appreciate that in particular, because I think it’s just poorly understood. Okay. So this is actually not super relevant to the podcast, but I’m personally curious about it. Can you summarize Ireland’s housing bubble and its subsequent crash in 2007? What happened there? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. You will see it given as an example of, well, this is almost like the textbook case of this is what happens when you let markets go wild. And I think that misses a key part of the story. Clearly the global credit gloss in the early 2000s was an important factor, but you have to rewind a little bit. And in the mid, late 1990s policy makers were grappling with this idea that Ireland is growing, Dublin is growing, how are we going to provide new housing? And they came up with this scheme that said, "Let’s regenerate parts of Dublin as Ireland’s biggest city and we’ll allow people to write off construction costs for building new homes." So it started out with this urban renewal thing, and that actually worked quite well. I mean, you had organizations that weren’t particularly familiar with building apartments, they’re used to building houses and then they were building apartments. So there might be other quality issues there that we can come back to. But overall, the goal of getting new housing, where there was long term demand was by and large met and actually rents fell during Ireland’s boom and bubble. So many new rental homes were built that rents were cheaper in 2004, 5, 6 than they were in ’98, ’99, 2000. And that’s fascinating because Irish people forget this because they just remember when the sale prices bit was through the roof. So politicians looked at this and went, "That’s interesting. So if we do this tax relief thing, we get lots of housing. So let’s try it in all the other constituencies where we want to get reelected," right? So they went off and they said, "Rural parts of Ireland, let’s get loads of housing built." And it was a no brainer for a developer because they could...the rental income didn’t have to be from the property they were building somewhere in rural Ireland. It could be from anywhere and it didn’t have to be that year. It could be, at some point over the next number of years. So they could build these properties and either good case scenario, they get someone to live in them, worst case scenario, they don’t, and they still get a lower tax bill and unsurprisingly tens of thousands of homes were built in places where there was no long term need. And at the same time you had this credit bubble, which was pushing up prices in lots of countries, the US, UK, Spain and Ireland was right up there at the fore, incomes were going up, confidence was high, banks were getting into mortgages. We had savings and loans like institutions building societies, but they gave way to the banks and the banks became the main mortgage providers, but they didn’t realize what they were playing with and they were giving people more and more leverage. So you had these two things going on, lots of new homes getting built and prices going up a lot. And then the global gloss stopped. The bubble stopped, the music stopped and then things turned pretty quickly. And the government at the same time decided to end the cost release. They were like, "Hang on, what are we doing here actually? And we should stop these release." So Ireland in around 2007 turned and went from a decade of phenomenal increases in the stock of housing and in prices, and that prices bit that was credit driven, it went the other way and prices fell by about 55% in the space of five years. And that’s like a national average. In some segments, if you’re in one of these places that got lots of extra housing, one of these rural markets, the cost of a smaller home might have fallen by 80%. And even to this day, some of those rural counties that saw the most construction relative to the number of people in those early 2000s years, housing today is still the same cost it was 20 years ago because so much was built. In Dublin, not enough was built even in the bubble years and housing is about a third more expensive now than it was in 2000. It’s certainly, not even 20 years, it went up and down and then up again. But paradoxically for...the narrative in Ireland would be that, "Well supply doesn’t keep prices under control because look what happened in the early 2000s." Paradoxically what happened in the early 2000s, when you take a step back and take out the credit bubble is a stunning endorsement of the idea that more supply makes housing more affordable because if you’re in Leitrim or Longford, which are these rural counties that saw some of the most housing built, housing is really affordable there now compared to Dublin where it’s not. Tamara Winter: And so that’s why in your Works in Progress piece, you talk about the Irish ghost towns that actually aren’t ghost towns or at least weren’t intended to be. It’s so funny because in that answer, you actually answer like the next three questions. Your dissertation at Oxford in it, you detail the various factors that affect home prices in Ireland. Could you share some of those factors? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. What I had in mind here and I guess, I’m slightly different to the standard academic because I had had that experience of seeing how policy makers worked, or at least I’d like to think I’m slightly...everyone does, right? Everyone’s slightly different. But I said, "Okay, there’s a morass of factors that can affect housing prices, but can we distill them down to the three, four, five, six most important ones? And I was lucky that I had a supervisor who sees...I’m in many ways, I’m a product of his way of seeing the world, right? My way of approaching a question like that, I like to think is mine, but really it’s, I’m inheriting a lot of his way of tackling these questions. So you could have 50 factors that drive house prices, but we were trying to come up with this list of the most important, so that we could say to policy makers, "If you’re looking at, if you want to control housing prices, if you want to see what’s going to happen next, these are the most important." And I mentioned household income, right? So if household income goes up or down and that can go up or down for a number of different reasons. One of the reasons household income went up in Ireland, say from the 90s to the 2010s was because more and more women were actively in the labor market. So instead of one income or one and a quarter income, you might have one and a half or two incomes and that will boost household income or unemployment, right? So in aggregate, the higher the unemployment rate, the fewer incomes there are per household, right? On average. So there’s a lot going on in that measure. So household income is one, household size is another. And one of the things that was under the hood at the time, and I’m focusing more on now to try and get the point across to policy makers, is that Ireland going from say a three and a half persons per household to two and three quarters, right? That pushed up prices by between 40 and 50% in the space of three decades or so. And I don’t think that’s appreciated. You’ve the same number of dwellings, but you’ve more and more households even with a similar population. And of course in Ireland’s case population was going up, household size was going down. So there’s an even greater increase in the number of households. And then there’s the supply factor, right? So controlling for all those demand factors, fundamental demand factors, the supply, and there’s the three fundamentals and you’ve got asset factors as well. And one of the asset factors is what’s known in the literature as user cost. So how much does it cost you to hold a property one year to the next? And some of that is they say expected capital gains, right? If you think your property’s going to go up 20% between now and next year, it doesn’t really matter if you have 1% property taxes or your cost of borrowing is 3%, you are going to get...you think you’re going to get this 20% gain. And that was a huge driver of demand. And then the final factor is credit conditions that how much...for a given set of savings, how much is the financial system leveraging you up? And in Ireland, like in many countries, we went from say, 25% deposits in the late 90s to sometimes 5% or 0% deposits in 10 years later. And if you think of that as in and of itself, going from 25% deposit to a 5% deposit, the same savings are going to get stretched at a huge amount more in terms of the mortgage you get given. Now, other factors come in there, but those are the five ones: household income, household size, housing supply, the user cost and credit conditions. And we put numbers beside them and said, "Okay, if you want to think about what drives house prices, an X percent increase in incomes will do this," and so on. Tamara Winter: Was it like multiple regression analysis? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So in terms of the methods, what we were using were...they’re macro econometric methods. So what you’re trying to do is run regressions where you want to maximize the ability of the data to tell you what’s going on. You don’t want to say, "Well, we’re going to assume people are this risk averse or that," whatever it might be, you want to let the data tell you as much as possible. So it makes sense on a first pass theory level, it makes sense that supply is going to be relevant for the cost of housing and incomes and so on. And you can put them in and see what they tell you. And you can also break it down and say earlier or later which factors are most important. And that was one of the punchlines at the time, which was almost 10 years ago, was that ’95 to 2001 prices increased…house prices increased a lot in Ireland, but it was a mix of lots of different things. As Ireland went from being a declining population country to a rising population, rising income country. ’01 to ’07, it was almost entirely credit conditions, right? Basically nothing else changed. Yes, supply went up, but incomes went up almost one to one to match. So that the...of the, I think it was the 8% increase on average per year in inflation adjusted housing prices, seven and a half percent was coming just from credit conditions. Tamara Winter: A comment and a question. The comment would be, I’ve never heard anybody mention the shrinking of household sizes being a relevant factor in the increasing demand for housing but it seems so obvious when you think about it. So that’s very interesting. The question would be, you mentioned something a few answers ago about the difference between New York and Tokyo, decades ago they had the same population size and now Tokyo is both much larger, but also...I mean, I don’t know how much larger, but also much denser. And I know that that... I know very little about this, but I know that’s related to the differences in how Americans are even extending it, the West tends to treat housing as an investment rather than how Tokyo in Japan tend to treat housing. Could you speak to those differences a little bit? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. And there’s a great author called Bill Fischel who’s written something called Homevoter Hypothesis and more recently had a book called Zoning Rules. And if you read Zoning Rules, he’s an economist himself one, who’s proficient in the law. And he has a good caricature of economists at the start of the book where it’s like an economist assumed that planners are just economically illiterate and stop the building of housing for some reasons due to their own preferences. And it’s like, no planners are responding to the demand for planning that when they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get reelected to do so, that people who come along and go, I will—but they won’t phrase it like this—I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes. That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way you’ve got to not dog whistle it in but you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "I’m going to price that new households," that’s a vote winner. And I think a lot of it comes from...there’s a website WTF Happened in 1971, right? There’s all these charts that suddenly just change in 1971. And we can think of lots of potential factors in there. But I do think the 1970s, the unexpected inflation in the 1970s, possibly driven by the oil price shocks or a combination of factors, including the oil price shocks in places like the US, opened the eyes of homeowners to the idea that if inflation comes along, your debt stays the same size in nominal terms and your property value goes up. So inflation is bad from a consumption point of view, but if you’re a homeowner, it’s good because the real value of your debt goes down. And we’ve known this, that’s why we had hyperinflation after World War I, countries wanted to get the real size of their debt down, just add a few extra zeros to your currency and the debt goes away, that kind of thing. But doing it for households in a mass home ownership environment, because of course what had happened between the 40s and the 70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate for potentially very good reasons. But what it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. And that was a key turning point because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet and in some ways they’re entitled to do that. If I own a home and in principle, I could go out there and actively try and minimize the new housing supply to maximize the value of my home. Now, I think that would be incredibly hypocritical of me given what I passionately believe about housing to be doing that. So I try and do the opposite. I try and argue for more housing, even though it’s not in my own interests. And the economists are laughed at for assuming people are always super automatons and rational and so on. But in my case, I’m living proof that that’s not the case, I suppose. But in general, I do think that that switch got flicked in say in the US in the 1970s and it didn’t happen in other places. And that might be because the age structure is different in Japan now, if you increase interest rates, that could be an economic spur to activity, right? Because the age structure of the population, they’re net savers as opposed to net borrowers or there’s different things going on in different countries or it could be just the way the shock is felt. The same shock, but it’s felt in different ways in different countries. But certainly if you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who were there already and secured their housing have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: It actually leads into...and I just have two more questions. The next question, which is, as you look...I find it unfortunate that, and I understand why these debates often get so charged, but I do find it a bit unfortunate and so I wonder as somebody who does support more liberalized zoning, what do you think are the most compelling arguments that opponents of liberalized zoning make? Ronan Lyons: I mean, there are...one relates to quality I think, and one relates to distribution, right? So people who...and I would have...in the Irish housing debate and people can go on Twitter and see, I would say something and you’ll have...there’s a group of people who will argue vehemently that, against say, if I argue for new rental housing in Dublin, because it badly needed, people would say, "No, the rental housing is getting proposed is not adequate." And they’ll say either, for example, either it’s not good enough quality, so we need higher quality standards. Personally, I don’t think that’s true of the housing that’s getting built at the moment. I think I’ve tried to come up with a measure of it. Of course I did, I’m an economist, but I’ve tried to come up with the measure of the quality of housing and I estimate the housing that’s getting built now about 50% higher quality in terms of the input materials than housing about 20 years ago. So I don’t think that’s true, but I’m sympathetic to the argument that if you build poor quality housing, you are creating future problems. So we should be rigorous in terms of housing. Now there’s an opportunity cost, which gets to the distribution point, the higher your minimum standards, the more of the income distribution you’re pricing out. And I estimate that say Dublin city’s minimum standards around 2015 priced at 90% of the income distribution and that’s pointless, right? It’s pointless having minimum standards that only allow 10% of people to enjoy new housing, because what you do is you create segregated markets. So from a distributional point of view, I think new housing shouldn’t be the preserve of the market or shouldn’t be the preserve of the state or whatever, I think we need a holistic approach that says, if you think of it as three groups in the population, you’ve the group that are rich enough based on current standards and prices to afford housing in the market. You have a group that are poor enough based on whatever the standards are for providing social housing, that they qualify for social housing. And then you’ve got a group in the middle who are not rich enough to afford market housing and not poor enough to qualify for supported housing. And really if I were a housing minister or a secretary, I mean, that is your goal. Your goal is to make sure that group doesn’t exist, that they’re either in the market or in the supported housing sector. And for both in order to achieve that, you need both those groups, the market housing segment and the social or supported housing segment to be responsive to underlying need. So that’s an argument where basically social or supported housing is a compliment to market housing. It’s not a substitute and I think that’s one of the...one of my get out of jail cards when some of my critics come along and say, "You’re just like a shield for developers and it’s all about profit for you." I have one guy who likes calling me a money astrologist because I’m an economist or whatever. I’m like, my estimate of housing need is high enough that I think the state should be supporting the construction of maybe 15 to 20,000 homes a year. So I don’t think...I don’t know of any competitor in Ireland’s case that has a higher estimate of socializing than me. I also have a higher estimate of market need, because I believe the underlying need say for one and two person households, as we get older, as we start our families later, all that kind of stuff is adding new housing need, diversity of housing need. So I think on quality and distribution, there are points to be listened to. I’m super reluctant to take into account…I think of this, right. I live in central enough in Dublin, I can see the Guinness tower, right? From my bedroom window. I can look at it and go, "There’s the Guinness Storehouse," which is like one of the most popular tourist attractions in Ireland. Now, it’s not particularly attractive, but suppose it were super attractive and I’m like, "That’s part of my view, right? Across the road, there’s a site that’s going to get redeveloped and they’re going to put in, I think, five or six stories in group of apartments. I think I should be entitled to say, "Well, yes, I don’t think you should build that because I have a lovely view.” Now I think that observation on the new development should be given a weight of close to zero, right? It is effectively irrelevant for society, right, that I have a view of the Guinness Storehouse from my bedroom window. It’s nice for me, I didn’t buy the property because out of the window, I can see the Guinness Storehouse or whatever it might be. I think we need to be a lot more clear about the weight we give to arguments that are effectively arguments to keep housing prices high. Tamara Winter: As you look across Ireland and then maybe more broadly across the world. Are there reasons for optimism on housing? Ronan Lyons: In Ireland, I think there are because things have been so...I mean, things were up and down for different reasons, but things have been so bad for the last 10 years that if you think of...just take the case of Dublin, Dublin is a city of about one and a half million people, about a half a million dwellings and the rental sector is about 150,000 rental dwellings, right? So not quite a third, but not far off. As things stand, they actually recognized this a couple years ago policy makers, they said, "We need to boost the supplier rental accommodation.” We are now in the opposite of the sweet spot. We’re in the eye of the storm at the moment because those plans have been lodged to build about 50,000 new rental homes but very few of them have come on stream. So you’ve people saying, "Look, you changed these rules three years ago," and of course COVID came in and didn’t help. And you changed these rules three years ago and nothing has changed. In fact, rents have gone up. Things are getting worse, not better. And I look and I see about 40 to 50,000 rental homes coming down on stream over the next five or six years. And I say, Dublin is going to be such a better city for having 200,000 rental homes rather than 150,000 rental homes. And yes, the new 50,000 are going to be expensive, but we have made them be expensive because we have high standards. And I know some people will disagree with that but I do believe that that’s true. We have high standards and the new rental accommodation is going to be expensive, reflecting that. So that’s the...I’m a natural born optimist. I see things getting slightly better and I do, and again, in the case of Ireland, I think the things were so bad in providing which you might think of as social or supported housing over the last 20 years. It was a decision in the early 1990s, implicitly, nobody ever stated this, but implicitly, it was let’s stop providing lots of social housing by the state and by lending more and more risky mortgages that we...and the US did the same thing effectively that that will step in, the market will step in for the state. And we know post 2007, that that’s not a reliable way to provide housing for all, but for about 10, 12 years in Ireland’s case, there was not a huge amount of progress. And just in the last 12 months or so, there’s been a bit of progress in terms of cost rental. So Jane Jacobs writes about this in her book about how would you provide housing for all…the Death and Life of Great American Cities. She talks about what we would call cost rental is that, if a third of your income is the most you can spend on housing, how could, what do you do for people for whom that’s not enough to cover the cost in new housing? And you got to top them up to get to that point. And Ireland is introducing a system a bit like that. And I think that’s going to make social housing or non-market housing, more responsive to underlying need. So I’m an optimist for Ireland, even though I could also give you the list of clouds in the horizon or things that I think are wrong, let’s go with optimism. More globally, if I’m an optimist it’s earlier in the pipeline of optimism, it’s hard to point generally. And it’s hard to summarize generally about housing. And there’s a couple of books actually, that I’ve seen coming out recently, one’s called Mass Housing, I think, and it’s trying to synthesize across countries. And actually some of my own work...I’m working on a project that’s funded by the National Science Foundation looking at housing prices in the US since the civil war and trying to measure prices at a city level. And in doing that and in doing the same for Ireland and in doing the same for Canada to contribute to an international, not debate, because I think that sets us up in the wrong, but International evidence base around what’s happening in housing markets now and how it fits into a longer term picture. But I’ve digressed a little bit. The drawing, I suppose, drawing conclusions about the global housing system or even the housing system in the high income world, if I’m optimistic, I think it’s because there’s a lot more people who believe housing to be important to research. And we know so much more than we did 10 years ago, so that’s on the research side, that of optimism. I think that will filter through into the policy side, but I do think that every country is going to have to come up with its own way of wrestling with the, yeah, the promiscuous veto with the power of incumbents and some of it, some countries may not be able to solve that until you’ve...things have got so bad. You’ve got a majority of renters in certain key parts of your country and then the power switches. Tamara Winter: Ronan, that’s all I have. Thank you, so, so, so much.

Archived audio: Is it for real? Oh, it’s for real now. Tamara Winter: It’s New Year’s Eve 2016. Then governor Andrew Cuomo and his wife descend an escalator underneath second avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Behind them, ride a gaggle of men in suits and women in evening gowns. Cuomo flashes a smile to one of the dozens of cameras followed by a thumbs up and a wave. They turn to board a colorfully decorated new subway car emblazoned with the words second avenue. It’s the kind of grandiose ribbon cutting moment that every politician dreams of. Archived audio: We needed to show people that government works and we can still do big things and great things, and we can still get them done. Tamara Winter: But this was no ordinary transit project. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project ever. Welcome to Beneath the Service, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our last episode, we looked at rising housing costs. Today we’re looking at what could be considered the other side of the same infrastructure coin, transit. I grew up in a suburb of Dallas, Texas. We have the Dart, or Dallas Area Rapid Transit, but its efficiency and convenience leave a lot to be desired. According to census data compiled by homearea.com, the share of commuters in the Dallas Fort Worth Metro area that use public transit is—1.4%. And that tracks with my experience. Growing up, I would take a train once in a while, but only on special occasions to the Texas state fair or the stockyards in Fort worth. Trains were a special treat, not something that was part of my main transportation diet. By contrast, I moved to New York City in 2021 and the city subway has just become a part of my daily life, as it is to 3.1 million other New Yorkers. And I learned that only a few years before I arrived, a new subway line opened underneath second avenue in Manhattan. It was a rare new addition to one of the largest and oldest subway systems in the world. Phase one of the project was completed in 2017. It is a modest two miles of track and three stations. It runs through the upper east side neighborhood. The price tag was around 4.4 billion dollars, and that’s just one of the four phases of construction. Phase two will extend the line north into East Harlem and is expected to open sometime between 2027 and 2029. The cost of phase two is expected to surpass that of phase one. Phases three and four would extend the line along Manhattan’s East side, all the way to the financial district at the Island’s Southern most point. These phases currently have no funding commitments or timelines. I guess the thing that gets me is that this subway line was first proposed in 1920, over 100 years ago. So, why has it taken so long to construct? Why is it costing so much? And what can we learn about public transit? Not only where the Second Avenue Project got it wrong, but where other places get it right. Sarah Kaufman: In New York city the subway is the lifeblood of the city. Tamara Winter: This is Sarah Kaufman. She’s the Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Sarah Kaufman: At NYU I do research, I conduct events, and I teach mostly around the topic of transportation and technology. Tamara Winter: She’s also worked at the city’s transit agency itself. Sarah Kaufman: I previously worked at the MTA, which is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority here in New York, which is the organization responsible for New York subways and buses, as well as several bridges, tunnels, and highways. Before COVID the subway was handling about five and a half million people per day. And then we also have the largest bus system in the country. And before COVID, it was handling about 2 million people a day. New York City does not function without its subway and bus systems, because that is how everyone gets around. In a lot of US cities, the only people who take buses or trains are lower income people, but here in New York you could be sitting next to a multimillionaire or someone who is very low income and everyone’s riding it together. It’s a great equalizer. Tamara Winter: Today, the subways might be the city’s lifeblood, but a quarter century before the first trains began running underground, elevated trains rumbled above Manhattan’s busiest avenues. Archival audio: Gleaming skyscrapers are traditional landmarks of New York, but there are other landmarks like the grimy ribbon of steel [inaudible 00:06:37]. Tamara Winter: They were loud, dirty, and choked the city’s street life under a canopy of metal. Archival audio: For 76 years, L trains clattered by carrying people to work and home again. But the old steel skeleton outlived its usefulness. Passengers dwindled, and so the L is being torn down. Tamara Winter: The city began phasing out these elevated trains, known to New Yorkers at the time as the L because the more modern underground subway lines were being built. Well, most of them were being built anyway. Sarah Kaufman: So the first concept for the Second Avenue Subway was published in 1920. And it was just an idea. And the city planned to start construction in the early 1930s, but as you know, the depression hit. And so there was no funding for a new subway line. Once the country recovered... Archival audio: Second Avenue. Miles of new housing need miles of new track. Sarah Kaufman: Different capital project amounts went into repairs and other subway lines and so there wasn’t funding for this project. There were fits and starts over time in the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s based on federal funding and state funding, as well as governance changes for the MTA itself. Archival audio: Much of the transportation future will be hidden below the ground in more than 50 miles of new subways. Soon, there will be a new two track subway that will run the length of Manhattan on Second Avenue, right up to the Bronx. Tamara Winter: The city did actually start construction in the early 1970s. However, New York City soon fell into severe economic and political turmoil, leading to high unemployment and rising crime. Archival audio: New York City Subway System. It has turned into a nightmare for the millions who ride it each day. The reason for the crime wave? The city says it doesn’t have the money to pay for transit police. Tamara Winter: Again, the Second Avenue Subway was put on the back burner. Sarah Kaufman: New York was left with several mini tunnels under Second Avenue, but nothing that connected and nothing that was yet able to have a train because these tunnels were not contiguous. Tamara Winter: The 1980s and ’90s saw the city crawl itself out of the fiscal hole and finally start to bring down the crime rate. In December 2001, just three months after the 9/11 attacks shook the city, research began on the impact of constructing the Second Avenue tunnels to the city and the environment. These impact statements were finished in 2004, and plans were developed for the next two years. Archival audio: One, two, three. Sarah Kaufman: So finally, construction resumed in the 2010s. Archival audio: We’re here today, starting up the tunnel boring machine, which you see behind me for the Second Avenue Subway. This is a tremendously exciting day. Sarah Kaufman: It was seen as a shovel ready project in the 2010s. A lot of it had to do with federal investment because this project was just too large for local or state investment to have completed. And so once there was a real federal commitment to transit, mostly thanks to Obama, the city was able to work on this project. Tamara Winter: That leads us to then Governor Cuomo’s grand opening gala. Unveiling a stretch of track from 63rd street to 96th street underneath Second Avenue. Archival audio: Thank you and God bless you. In a few minutes and we’re going have a great New Year. Thank you. Tamara Winter: So yes, nearly a hundred years later, the Second Avenue subway was eventually built. Well, one of four parts were built. And pre pandemic, the line saw around 200,000 weekday riders. That’s more than the entire Atlanta Rapid Transit System. So sure it’s doing its job, but then there’s the issue of cost. Sarah Kaufman: The Second Avenue subway was the most expensive subway built in the history of the world in mile-per-mile basis. Tamara Winter: The total cost was around $2.6 billion per mile. Sarah Kaufman: There’s a lot of great research done about construction costs in the US being just astronomically high. If you look at the work of Alon Levy... Alon Levy: Okay, I found the sound recorder. My name Alon Levy. Tamara Winter: Alon Levy is a transit researcher. They run the websites, Pedestrian Observations, and the Transit Costs project. Alon’s interest in transit costs started when they were studying for their PhD in New York. Alon Levy: I got an interest in the subway. It’s just a thing that people do in New York, they ride this train. And I saw, okay, this is how this system laid out and started thinking about maybe gaps in the system. What could we edit? What would we change? And somehow this has gone to trying to compare it with a lot of other big systems. And this is when I realized, just through a little bit of Googling, that the construction costs of subway construction in New York, the Second Avenue subway were very high. Tamara Winter: That led them to look at other subway projects. Alon Levy: They checked a bunch of huge global cities. Tamara Winter: Alon found that the global average cost of transit projects was around 400 million dollars per mile. The Second Avenue project was six times that. This led them to start the Transit Costs Project. It’s a website that catalogs the costs of transit projects around the world. Alon Levy: Right now we have a database, it’s something like 600 items. We have close to complete coverage of subways built in the last 20 or 25 years. Tamara Winter: The Second Avenue subway is extreme, both in timeline and cost, but it’s not unusual in the US for transit projects to fall behind schedule and go over budget. According to the Transit Costs Project, transit projects in the US are the sixth most expensive in the world. The countries that are one through five are New Zealand, Hong Kong, Qatar, Singapore and the UK respectively. However, there’s an important caveat to the data here. Digging tunnels and building underground rail, like a subway, make construction much more expensive than simply laying down rail over land. The five countries I listed are building projects that are more than 80% tunneled. New Zealand and Singapore’s projects are a hundred percent tunneled. In the US only 37% of track is tunneled. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, I would say the US performs pretty badly. It’s not that it’s without any bright spots. There are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. Tamara Winter: This is Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. Tamara Winter: We met online several years ago, through Twitter, naturally. I immediately became a fan of his insight and how he communicates his ideas about transit Alex Forrest: As with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here. It’s hard to know where to start. Tamara Winter: Culprit one: labor costs. Alex Forrest: With our construction crews, we need them to be professional trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contracts or else, what are we doing here? Tamara Winter: Here’s Sarah Kaufman. Sarah Kaufman: As compared to most other countries that have transit systems, employers in the US have to pay out worker benefits, which significantly adds to the cost. Subway construction happening in France for example, the cost would be somewhat lower because the employer would not be responsible for the health and wellness of the workers. Tamara Winter: Culprit number two: practice. You know that old saying, “practice makes perfect”? Alex Forrest: The USA had a first rate best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. Archival audio: And here’s one of the most wonderful things about this vast country of ours. No matter where we want to travel, there are trains. Beautiful, comfortable… Tamara Winter: At its peak in the early 20th century, the US had over a quarter million miles of railroad tracks. Nearly every major US city, from Atlanta to Los Angeles, had either street cars or subways that a majority of commuters took to work. For more reasons than we have time to get into in this episode, the latter half of the 20th century saw the tides begin to turn. Alex Forrest: At that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us where we are today. Tamara Winter: There’s no consistent new building of transit projects. And so everyone is all kind of out of practice. So when a new project does need to get underway, it’s like starting from square one every time. Alex Forrest: A lot of transit agencies in the US should be developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors the better you are just at the industry in general. The more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system is just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Culprit number three: transit agencies. Often in the US, a patchwork of different agencies all have different motives. Sarah Kaufman: Here in New York, and this is true in several other US cities. We have this division of jurisdictions that is hard fought. The subways and buses are run by one organization, the commuter rails, Metro North and Long Island Railroad another. Meanwhile, we have the path train, which is one of the commuter trains to New Jersey run by the Port Authority, and then New Jersey Transit, which runs other trains to New Jersey. It’s pretty incredible how many different organizations needs to come together. And frankly, they don’t. When you look at other countries, they have more of a regional and national perspective on coordinating interests across boundaries. Tamara Winter: Lastly, perhaps the most guilty culprit: Us, the public. There’s that other old saying, time is money. Well, in the case of transit projects, the longer these things go on for, the more expensive they get. These delays are often a result of NIMBYs. People who favor projects in general, but when they happen near them, they say not in my backyard. We discussed NIMBY attitudes around new housing development in our previous episode. And the same issues can be seen when it comes to transit projects, too. Sarah Kaufman: We do have a public engagement process where people can oppose transit and here in the US, people wildly oppose transit. They do not want buses and subways coming to their neighborhoods and overwhelmingly they come to community meetings and oppose it. Whereas in other places, the community has less input because it’s seen as a community betterment project. And so that process, which can take years here, is a non-issue elsewhere. Tamara Winter: Residents will often weaponize regulations such as environmental protection laws in an attempt to stop what they see as an encroachment on their neighborhoods. Alex Forrest: People are loathed to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. Trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given projects, not the least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Tamara Winter: All these factors add to transit costs in the US. Excessive labor costs, a lack of in-house planning expertise, multiple out of step transit agencies, and NIMBY’s dragging out project timelines. Part of the reason that Alon Levy started the Transit Cost Project was because they believed that if the US was able to look outside it’s borderers, the shared knowledge and learning from other global cities will help transit projects everywhere. Even New York. Alon Levy: There’s this unfortunate tendency in New York to say, oh, New York, especially, you don’t have anything to learn from. So we don’t have anything to learn from to a degree. We don’t have anything to learn from Milan. We don’t have anything to learn from Stockholm. Tamara Winter: Every transit system has things it does well and things it can improve on. But the more I dove into the world of transit, the more I realize that all roads, or all railroads, lead to one place. Japan. Tamara Winter: This is the sound of Shinjuku station. It stretches for more than a half a mile through the Shinjuku ward and the heart of Tokyo. The area is a major commercial and administrative hub. Every day it sees 3.6 million passengers making it the busiest public transit center in the world. There are five railway and subway companies that intersect here. They link the Tokyo Metro to lines that service the suburbs West of the city. By one account, there are 53 platforms and over 200 entrances and exits to this massive complex. There’s also long distance bus service. While Shinjuku is the busiest station, it’s hardly alone. There are nearly a dozen other major transit hubs spread across various wards in Tokyo. Each of these services 1 to 3 million passengers daily. The rest of the world doesn’t even come close. Take New York’s Penn Station, the busiest train station in the entire Western hemisphere. It sees over 600,000 weekday passengers. That’s one sixth of Shinjuku station. In fact, of the 50 busiest train stations in the entire world, 45 are in Japan. Train ridership can only get to these high numbers when the system runs effectively. In fact, in Japan it’s nearly perfect. Junichi Sugiyama: So desu ne. Hai, hai. Tamara Winter: This is Mr. Junichi Sugiyama. Junichi Sugiyama: I live in Yokohama, Japan. Tamara Winter: He’s a journalist who writes about train, travel and business. And he’s ridden on every single rail system in Japan. Junichi Sugiyama: Next I’d like to like to ride the Amtrack across the United States. I will practice my English to help with my travels. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Japanese people feel proud that the railroad system is so reliable and punctual, and when they can say there’s a train station close to where they live. Punctuality and accuracy is the most important thing so that people know exactly when to leave the house and when they will arrive at their destination. Tamara Winter: Let’s look at the Long Island Railroad, which operates out of Penn Station. The system considers a train on time if it arrives or departs within 5 minutes and fifty-nine seconds of the scheduled departure. Even with this generous measure, nearly 20,000 trains run late every year. Now contrast this to Tokyo. Every year the city’s entire system experiences accumulated delay of 20 seconds. Even these precious few seconds are an infraction worth an apology, like this statement that went viral in 2017. Archival audio: A company in Japan is apologizing after one of its trains left 20 seconds early. The company released a statement that reads in part, we deeply apologize for the severe inconvenience imposed upon our customers. That’s incredible. For comparison, to review [inaudible 00:24:28]. Tamara Winter: Imagine a trained company in the US making a formal public apology for leaving 20 seconds early. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: By increasing the frequency of trains, it will be more convenient for residents in the area. And subsequently, the town will develop. Ultimately, the goal is to have an accurate and efficient operating system. Tamara Winter: Tokyo also manages to integrate its various train operators very well. Here’s Alon Levy. Alon Levy: Tokyo has something very precious, which is that it manages to integrate urban and suburban transit very well. So the commuter rail lines in Tokyo run through the subway system and moreover the subway system was built to form a tight mesh within the city, but also connect with these commuter lines. So Tokyo essentially built a subway system at metropolitan scale. Tamara Winter: The system in Japan is not without its drawbacks. For example, in Tokyo the high number of competing transit companies leave riders paying with a jumble of different methods. But it’s efficient and on time, and the high quality of Japan’s transit system extends into the smallest details. Here’s Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: There’s something much more every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies. It’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. If you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: Clearly, the Japanese love their trains. And like so many love stories, it started in a time of war. Following its defeat in World War II, Japan was occupied by the American military. In Japan this is referred to as GHQ, or General Headquarters. Its aim was to establish democracy and rebuild the country Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Prior to the war, the Japanese National Railways, or JNR for short, was built and operated by the federal government. But, when the war ended, JNR was relaunched by GHQ in order to make the railway system more sustainable. Converting it into a public enterprise. Tamara Winter: The government operated railway became a government owned public corporation. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: JNR incurred a large deficit of 37 trillion yen, which almost exceeded Japan’s national budget. Tamara Winter: On top of mounting debt, confrontation increased between management and the labor unions leading to numerous strikes. Fares were up, ridership was down. It all came to a head in 1987. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The country couldn’t support it anymore. So they made a drastic reform. All of this debt was settled and the private company was created. This was the beginning of the JR Group. The corporation was split into six private passenger companies. Each was designated a different region of the country. There was also a freight and research company created. Most of the JR Group companies were granted the freedom to operate as private entities. And so they made efforts to lure back passengers. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: From the perspective of the rider, the staff have become kinder. After becoming JR, they started to focus on service. Because it’s an independently profitable and private company, they felt that they had to make a profit. And in order to make a profit, a lot of customers have to feel comfortable and satisfied. So the employee education was reviewed and the service was improved. Tamara Winter: There was also a marketing push. One example is this now famous series of JR Group Christmas commercials in the late 1980s. Archival audio: Christmas express. Tamara Winter: The train companies were allowed to capture the upside of their own service. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: It was stipulated by law that the national railway should not actually do business beyond building and managing railways. They were told that they could not invest in hotels, real estate, or super markets, as it would put pressure on private companies. However, once JR became a private company, it was possible to expand into new businesses, such as hotels, ski resorts, and real estate. Tamara Winter: And so JR Group companies had a larger financial stake in the areas around their train stations succeeding economically. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The biggest business is to use stations to build shopping centers or condominiums. The station is not just a train station, but a base for business. It’s where people gather together. So you can have a lot of different businesses there. When Japanese railways developed, they bought a lot of land at a low price first, and later put down a railroad track and then the price of the land would go up. So they would sell it. Many urban railways in Japan have operated not only as railways, but also by diversified management. Tamara Winter: Today JR East, the JR Group company that operates through Tokyo is the largest, fully privatized passenger rail company in the world. Alex Forrest: This method of assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future, which they call value capture nowadays. Tamara Winter: In fact, this is not that different from how railways in the US were built. However, there are several key differences. Alex Forrest: When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these inter urban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains. This was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation, and then you didn’t really care what happened next. That was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. Tamara Winter: And given his own background, Alex Forrest actually has a unique perspective on this. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Mishara. Once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a twenty to thirty minute walk and take the train two stops over to go to church. This train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, but it runs like eight car trains using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. At the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every 2 to 3 minutes. This is the first train that I ever rode. I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old. The stations were pretty grimy at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. The whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan and clean. From that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world. By the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America, or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s now 2022 in New York. Archival audio: This is the 96th street train. The next stop is 72nd street. Stand clear. Closing doors. Tamara Winter: The first phase of the Second Avenue subway has been running for just over five years. Archival audio: Good afternoon. We certainly meet in the most unusual places here in New York. Very delighted to be here beneath the second avenue subway. Something that we’ve been talking about for a very long time... Tamara Winter: Governor Kathy Hochul has moved forward phase two of the project, largely thanks to president Biden’s $23 billion infrastructure investment and jobs act. Archival audio: Ladies and gentlemen, next stop 125th street. With that, I’d like to introduce a gentleman... Tamara Winter: And the investment will go even further at this time. While phase one served mainly a high wealth area, phase two will extend into East Harlem, a neighborhood, largely working class and highly reliant on public transit. According to the governor’s office, 70% of residents here use public transit to commute versus the citywide average of 55%. For the people along the next phase of Second Avenue, this development would be a huge life change. And that’s the thing. Transit is the type of infrastructure with the power to change people’s daily life. Whether in New York, or a city like Dallas, where I grew up. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what’s the critical difference here, right? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. There are lots of problems in the New York subway, but just the fact of its availability, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population. You’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: In the end, I am perhaps foolishly optimistic about the prospects for a more transit oriented feature in the US. For one thing, young people are becoming more vocal about their desire for alternatives to driving. And as America continues to age, developing these alternatives will be increasingly important for seniors who don’t want to be relegated to their homes in their later years. I see bright spots like Cul-de-Sac, a new car-free city development being built in Tempe, Arizona and private companies like Brightline in Florida and Texas Central are also developing intercity rail projects in places that have long been deeply car-centric. I’m hoping we’ll see a lot more experimentation in the years to come. Alex Forrest: I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome, and it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here. It’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long. Even convincing people if they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Sarah Kaufman: America has a real addiction to cars and most of our communities are built around use of cars. And so it can be very hard to give up car usage, even if somebody tried. At the same time, I think that the younger generations in the US are seeing that and taking advantage of transit and biking and other options as better ways to get around. I hope that the interest in transit continues. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak.

I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. We’ll see you next time. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-Sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. On the most recent episode of Beneath the Surface, we focused on the state of public transit in the US, and we compared it with one of the most train loving countries in the world: Japan. For this episode, I interviewed Alex Forrest. He is currently a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. I’ve been a fan and a friend of Alex’s for years. He’s cultivated a community of trained fanatics on Twitter…train Twitter that is, where he shares his thoughts on the state of train travel in places like the US and Japan, where he lived for several years as a child. His username is @380kmh, which might seem a bit random, but it’s the top design speed for most high speed trains. In our conversation, we discussed his current work in Springfield, the formative years he spent in Japan, the history of train development in the US, and more. So here is my conversation with Alex Forrest, which has been lightly edited. I hope you enjoy. So the first question is always the hardest. Introduce yourself. Tell me your title and why are we talking today? Alex Forrest: My name’s Alex Forrest. I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. And we are talking today about transit around the world and how to do it well. Tamara Winter: Tell me a little bit about your current work as a transit planner. When we were chatting about this episode a little bit, you told me that you just won funding for two lines. Is that right? Alex Forrest: Two bus routes, right. So my work in transit is limited to bus operations. That’s the transit provider that I work for, operates out of three bus garages in Western Mass, about 35 to 40 routes. It varies a little bit by time of year. And in the past couple years, I was able to win funding from MassDOT to operate two new services. Both are kind of longer range intercity kind of services. One of them runs on a roughly hourly frequency on the Interstate. The other is just a three times a day through a state highway connecting to Worcester, it’s a service that we’ve had a lot of interest in riders from. And I’m a little disappointed that we couldn’t provide more than just these three round trips, but it was great to be able to get that running. Tamara Winter: Talk to me about the transit situation broadly in Massachusetts, and also kind of how does the transit system in the broader north-east differ from the rest of the US? Alex Forrest: Massachusetts works nicely as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country in that you have Boston, which is our north-east, I suppose. And then you have the rest of the state, which I mean, the rest of the state was settled very early. So it doesn’t necessarily have the same town patterns that you’ll find in the rest of the country. But in terms of transit availability, I think it’s a working analogy, it does the trick, which is to say MBTA is the transit provider in Boston. They run four subway lines, one of which doubles as kind of a surface streetcar route. They run a myriad of bus lines, including some nominal BRT routes. They also run ferries and commuter rail around Eastern Massachusetts. So very extensive network. One of the top performing networks for ridership in the USA. There are also, I want to say, maybe 15 or so regional transit authorities elsewhere in the state. Most of which have sort of one central city and a defined service area. And their job is to provide exclusively bus operations. Now it’s not written in, but that’s just how it works out, throughout the other parts of the state, not a bad model conceptually, but one of the oversights of it is that they made no account for travel between the regional transit authorities, which is why this route to Worcester was such a big deal. I mean, in Eastern Mass, the various regional transit authorities at least can get close to Boston or connect to an MBTA service. But beyond Worcester, that starts to become impossible and broadly speaking, the RTAs obviously get a lot less money than the MBTA. They have much cheaper services to run in the first place, but one of the consequences of this is that very few...it might only be PVTA, which is the one that I work at, very few RTAs actually offer weekend service. Most of them only offer service on weekdays. I think until recently, that was the case, even in Worcestor, which would be the next largest after us. But you will want to look into that. I’m not sure, they might have started running weekend service recently. Tamara Winter: It’s kind of wild though. You said this is sort of a microcosm for the rest of the US. Talk to me about how you would rate the US public transit system kind of compared to other countries specifically in regards to rapid transit. And when you decide on a rating, I’m curious why the US merits that rating. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, just because that is an admittedly pretty high bar, and so a lot of countries are still working on that or don’t really need to, I would say the US performs pretty badly. I don’t know about a out of 10 score and it’s not that it’s without any bright spots, but just there are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. As far as the analogy goes for Massachusetts, one of the issues is that transit is very much a localized affair. And so where it exists at all, you might have reasonable transit, but anywhere else as kind of a national system, it’s sorely lacking. So connections between city areas are probably the worst component in the USA. And then within cities, there are various other issues just concerning schedule availability. Like I talked about the no weekend service, that’s hardly unique to Massachusetts, it’s true all around the USA. Even some rail systems. I want to say the Los Angeles commuter rail, I’m not convinced they run on weekends, or if they do, most commuter rail systems which do run on weekends, offer greatly reduced service. So, they prioritize specifically the times when they think it’s most likely people will ride. Which again, that sounds very reasonable, but that’s not actually the best way to run a transit network and we have empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. So we don’t need to be led by assumptions there. Tamara Winter: To ask maybe a silly question, because there are theories that I can see, for example, for why this is the case. The US developed much later than its peers, the decision-making power to create transit, particularly between cities is kind of difficult to, I guess, manage because of our Federalist system. Why is our transit so lacking? Alex Forrest: As you kind of suggested, it’s definitely one of those path dependent problems. The system is lacking here just because we sort of evolved this way through various small decisions. But the part of the reason we’re lacking now is because we’re actually very, very far ahead of the curve, about a 100 years ago. And it’s not quite as simple as the success went to our heads and we thought nobody could do it better than us, and so if we can’t do it well, we don’t even need to bother. It’s not quite that simple, but that’s definitely part of it. And the USA had a first rate, best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. But even before that, even before the early 20th century, there were some fundamental problems in how we developed our system. And those problems led to complications when the original developers of railways and local transit networks in America started to run into cost issues, not entirely just because of a lack of business, but also because they were hamstrung in their ability to set their own fares. A lot of municipal ordinances would require transit providers to operate a flat fare across an entire region, which is not best practice. You really want to charge by distance traveled. And also, that flat fare was limited. At the time, I think it was a nickel or a dime, just because we’re talking about the 1920s, ’50s here. The inability to raise fares to deal with drops in revenue kind of ensured that the old railway operators couldn’t survive and a handover would be necessary. So then we get to kind of step two, which is the mid-20th century handover when a lot of the trolley companies were replaced by bus companies and the intercity private railways got out of the passenger business entirely with the formation of Amtrak. And so at that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us to where we are today. There have been various attempts, no shortage of money spent, although at the same time, kind of not enough, it’s complicated. I guess you could say they spent the money on not the best things for keeping the system going. And even to this day, a lot of baked in costs like that, just from the way we’ve done things so far. I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome. And it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here, it’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long, even convincing people they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Tamara Winter: It’s funny, if we were re-cutting a trailer for the podcast today, most of what you just said would be kind of a prime target for it, because I think this is kind of the crux of creating infrastructure. From the outside, as I’ve been talking to people, whether they’re building new cities, so talking about kind of what is it about Lagos that would necessitate a new city? Or for example, the Salton Sea and its potential to be kind of a lithium mine, it’s interesting. There isn’t kind of one culprit for why things aren’t better than they are or why some things worked. It really does appear to be kind of pack dependence in inertia all the way down. And you add into that, infrastructure typically doesn’t have...it needs a policy entrepreneur, but it’s very difficult to kind of just make large scale changes even when we know what it is we need to do. And I guess speaking of cost, you kind of mentioned this in your last answer. I’m curious, if you could elaborate, in your experience, why are transit costs in the US so much more expensive and why does it take so much longer to develop transit in the US than in other similarly situated countries? Alex Forrest: Before I get started, I want to just break down the two main sides of cost in transit. One being the operating expense, just to pay the drivers, maintain the vehicles, keep the service on the road. And then the other being capital expense, which would be to replace the vehicles, get new ones to build any stations, garages, any kind of train service requires capital expense on its track. Both are more expensive in the USA, but the operating costs are, I would say, a lot more defensible by and large. They’re not perfectly defensible. There’s some problems there too. Really, it is the capital costs that are the biggest problem. It’s the large infrastructure projects. Those are the ones where the costs are just wildly inflated. And again, as with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here, it’s hard to know where to start. There is the kind of NIMBY angle where people are loath to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. So it’s trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given project, not least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Part of it has to do with staffing and what, I guess, I can only call unrealistic agreements with labor. Which, again, this comes back to the inertia thing, it’s obviously critical that we have well paid and compensated drivers for any of our vehicles. You don’t want people crashing on the road. And likewise with our construction crews, we need them to be professional, trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contract. What are we doing here? This is a problem that Japan had a crisis with in the late ’70s to 1980s, which ultimately led to the privatization of their national railways. There were various causes, it boiled down to a labor dispute and they were able to work it out and solve that issue back then. So yes, in the USA, right, we have just regulations. People’s ability to interfere with the project can ramp up the cost tremendously. We have relatively expensive labor, not even the expensive labor is the issue, but the overstaffing, where you just have way more people on a crew than you particularly need to do it. This also shows up in transit operations where you might have...the practice of having conductors on a train to pick up tickets is definitely not the way they do it in Japan, for example, where either if a train line is so quiet that you can’t just have fare gates at the station, then the driver of the train will check the tickets instead of having another guy wander around to do it, needless to say, those are only on the quieter rural lines. So I guess that’s only two subjects right now. There are more, I don’t even want to get started on the EBA and requirements for environmental impact statements, which, again, depending on how zealously the jurisdiction wants to push the issue, they can take years, if not...I don’t think any have taken more than a decade. Tamara Winter: Well, speaking of a transit project that took more than a decade, this episode begins with the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, which was first proposed, I believe, in a little over a 100 years ago. I wonder, are there other transit projects you can think of in the US that have similarly been extremely, exorbitantly expensive and also taken forever just to get off the ground? Alex Forrest: Yes. I think, frankly, you would’ve a much harder time finding projects for which that isn’t the case. I know that just recently in Boston, there’s a lot of celebration as a extension of the Green Line into Somerville, Mass opened. This goes to Union Square in Somerville, which is very close to where I lived in the mid ‘90s, living just on the border of Somerville and Cambridge. So it’s very heartening to think that finally, my old neighborhood has its own stop. I don’t remember the exact year, but I do remember when this project was being discussed back in at least 2004, if not earlier, I think versions of it have been on the drawing board since at least the 1940s. This particular round was finally authorized and it began construction sometime around also 2004, I want to say. And it was originally slated to open in 2011. So here we are now, it’s part open. There’s still more of it to open, which I think will open later this year, but they haven’t even finished opening it yet. And I’m as happy as the next guy that it’s finally here, but well over budget. I mentioned neighbors getting involved to just jack up the costs. Sometimes that does produce nice fruits, even if it does inflate the cost significantly. In this case, it involved connecting to a multi-use bike path, which branched off the Green Line Extension. There was already a bike path branching off it. They just wanted to run the bike path parallel to this new extension and connect it into the larger city bike network. A nice addition, but again, not strictly related to this project, did not need to get bundled in, inflated the timelines and the planning process, led to constant revisions. And so finally, here we are, halfway through 2022 and we’re not even done opening it. Tamara Winter: By Second Avenue Subway standards, that’s actually very, very impressive. But, of course, we are grading on the world’s biggest curve. Alex, I’ve known you for a few years and you have kind an unusual story with how you came into transit. Tell me a little bit about your unusual childhood and why you got so interested in transit in the first place. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were still kind of moving around quite a bit and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. This was in 1991, and I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Machida. And I would describe Machida as on one hand, very much a suburb, outside the city proper, mostly single family housing, but also, it has nearly half a million residents right now. And it’s got its fair share of large buildings as well. So it’s a suburb, but a Tokyo suburb, to be clear. Anyway, living out there for two years, I was about old enough to go to preschool. I attended a preschool a short walk from my parents’ apartment, but every week, once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a 20 to 30 minute walk, shorter on a bike or a bus, and take the train two stops over to go to church. And so this train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, it’s far out in the suburbs, I don’t know, maybe 15 miles away from Tokyo, I’m not sure. But it runs eight car trains, using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. And that’s where the local stops at the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every two to three minutes. So to have this out in the suburbs, this beautiful train, this is the first train that I ever rode, of course. And so if you look at Japanese culture, there’s certainly a carve out for the train nerds. They’re generally photographers. They like to take photos of trains and they know everything about them. I can see why kids growing up there would do that because the same effect hit me. The only difficulty was I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride. I was so happy. I didn’t have to abandon trains forever. The downside was they were American trains and that did not at all dim my enthusiasm as a five-year-old, six-year-old kid. I still loved riding them, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old, the stations were pretty grimy, at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. Just in general, the whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan, and clean. So anyway, just from that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world, just always taking the chance to ride it whenever I can. But by the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s so crazy because the way you talk about Japan, I literally thought you had grown up there for many, many years. It’s amazing that all it took was two years and two of the most formative years in your childhood for you to kind of catch the train bug. Alex Forrest: Right. Well, and I have siblings as well and they didn’t quite catch the bug either. So it certainly depends on the person, but it was, I guess...you said it best, it was a very formative time in my life. And so those at the stage when I was just beginning to form memories, so basically, my earliest memories are of living in Japan, but I was also not so young that the whole thing was a blur. I had pretty concrete memories, for instance, of our trip on the last day when we were heading to Narita Airport, I remember the train we were on because it had a nice LED animated map showing the route we were going. And so I was just mesmerized, I could check off every station as we stopped on it and see the train in advance. Tamara Winter: You mentioned that you could clearly see, even at that age, the differences between US trains and Japanese trains. In your opinion, what are some of the main, maybe social and cultural differences that affect kind of how the US and Japan treat public transit? Alex Forrest: I think Japan has a reputation for very good manners and that’s incredibly well-deserved. In general, Japanese people are just very polite and they’re very social in public. They’re not going to make a mess in general or make a lot of noise or have a loud conversation, which is just kind of broadly refreshing, but hard to really imitate here. As far as kind of attitudes, social and cultural attitudes, there’s also sort of the impression that...and I mean, it helps to be on the cutting edge of the technology to do this, but there’s something much more glamorous and just every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies, it’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. Part of the reason that any reformers had any leverage here was that the public expected and demanded better service of the railways than they were delivering at that time. I’m hard pressed to come up with any more...you’ve heard the saying, "Why take a shower? I’ll just get dirty again." Tamara Winter: Yes. Alex Forrest: When, in fact, the point of taking a shower is precisely because you will get dirty again, so you want to be clean until that happens. I feel like that is kind of the attitude just as far as general maintenance goes. When I’m in Japan...I was visiting some years ago, I went to my old train station and they just had a guy...he was a part-timer apparently, but this is a very common thing there. They just had a guy walking up and down the staircases at the train station, just wiping down the banisters and walls, in the middle of the afternoon, it was 2:00 PM. He looked like he might have even been a retiree, which is why I gathered he was a part-time worker because senior citizens will often end up taking just odd jobs like that. But the fact that they actually have a position for this, you’re the guy who just wipes the station down every few minutes or so during the afternoon, they probably have another guy for the evening. But that kind of constant maintenance, much more so than people’s cultural inclination not to litter, is what makes the difference there. I feel like despite the well-deserved reputation for manners in Japan, people also tend to forget that they’re just human. People absolutely do litter there and they’ll leave things behind just out of forgetfulness, of course. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. Just if you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: There’s something kind of interesting too. I don’t know the extent to which Japanese people just care more about their services, but it does seem like they expect more of their services than maybe we do. You can see those differences, we don’t have to just look at Japan and the US, even in say Dallas, where I grew up, and New York, where I live now, in Dallas, it’s expected that you really only ride the light rail if you need it as a connection downtown, let’s say you work downtown or just, if you can’t afford your own private transit, whereas in New York, I wouldn’t say it’s like Japan in that it’s totally ubiquitous, but it’s pretty ubiquitous, right? It’s not unusual to see people of very different kind of socioeconomic statuses riding the train together. And so even in the US, you can kind of see, and people in New York, of course, are accustomed to, and sort of demand much more. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what is the critical difference here? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. And as you said, it’s not necessarily as useful and ubiquitous as in Tokyo, although certainly, it comes closer than anywhere else in America. And it’s also, certainly not as well-maintained as what you have in Tokyo. There are lots of problems with the New York Subway, but just the fact of its availability. As terrible as these trains are, as dirty or as overheated or whatever the problem is, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population, you’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Whenever a new bus route wants to get proposed, you’ll usually have some interested party who says, "Ah, we need bus service here. There’s a lot of jobs here. There’s a lot of houses here." And generally, in this assumption is not just that there’s a lot of jobs or houses, but, "There’s a lot of low income houses here. We need a bus here." "Oh, there’s a benefit center here. We need a bus to go there." And so if you have a bus line that only goes between those two places, between the low income apartments and the Social Security offices, that doesn’t particularly do a good job of addressing the needs of people in those apartments or those offices, let alone anybody else. The people in those apartments also need to go to the doctor. They also need to go to the grocery store. They also would like to visit friends. These are all trip purposes that are being completely ignored in the calculus of where to put the bus and you can solve all these issues if you just stop thinking of, "Ah, we only need to worry about these particular people who are going to ride." No, you have to think about anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: I love that tagline. If there’s a person, there’s a potential rider. I want to talk about Japan a little bit more. Can you explain sort of briefly...although I don’t know if this is a brief kind of question, how Japanese rail companies operate as private companies? You’ve mentioned this earlier, but specifically around real estate speculation and development. Alex Forrest: It’s actually not that different, at least superficially, from how a lot of the railways in the USA were built up. Although there are, I think, a couple of critical differences that I hope I can get to, but the premise of the land use speculation really was something that happened around the time that the cities were still growing. And the railway industry was still pretty new in Japan, but you had suburban streetcar operators in say early 1900s Tokyo and Osaka. Some of which became quite successful and began running what in America, we would call interurban lines, which are not mainline freight, but they basically have the same standards in terms of their heavy rail operations. Generally running electricity, even for the USA back then in the 1900s. But in America, the interurbans all ultimately got shut down more or less, a few survivors, modern transit lines. But in Japan, a lot of them were founded as private companies. Most of them were able to stay as private companies and gradually phased away from streetcar operations to focus on their interurban lines, which over the years, were extended, branches were added, through service onto the subways was added. And so these interurban lines evolved into modern suburban rail. These are for companies that remain private the entire time. Japan also had a national railway industry, which originated as an amalgam of government funded lines and privately built lines, was run by the Imperial Japanese government through the war, and then by the reconstruction government after the war, and which was ultimately privatized in 1987 and broken up into several subsidiary companies. So the premise is you build a line out of the city, you develop the land around that line and therefore you plant passengers for yourself who will then use your line to go back and forth to the city. This is indeed how a lot of rail in America got built too, at least at the commuter level, not necessarily at the intercity level, but one of the most critical differences that a lot of people who are interested in this method, which they call value capture nowadays, assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future. When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these interurban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. Cannot emphasize this enough. If you look at a suburban operator in Japan, yes, they are invested in land use. Yes, they do take steps to make sure that their own ridership will be there, but that’s not the part which makes them the money. That’s just the background work. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains or buses. And this was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation and then you didn’t really care what happened next. You’d have a success where they take over the company. And that was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. And so, I think, that at least was part of why you had these interurban operators and streetcar operators in America running into trouble. I don’t mean to say it’s entirely their fault either. We cannot underestimate the impact of having tons of cars on the road, since a lot of American transit operators didn’t have dedicated rights of way, and so they’d be slowed down by anything that got in their path. But that’s also to say, I don’t want people to think it was entirely the evil car companies that did this. There were some really serious structural problems with American railway operators, which really doomed their efforts in the passenger rail business. Might have been overcome, but would not have come from the railways themselves, I don’t think. You would’ve needed a government intervention, which was a very, very tough sell and remains that to this day. Tamara Winter: That’s kind of the natural next question for me. So you say you might have an operator in kind of a regional line or a smaller line. Yes, they might invest in land and they might be speculating, but that’s really not where they make their money. How does that model compare to how transit agencies across the US are expected to function? Are there any US agencies that work like that? Alex Forrest: I don’t know if you could say there are any agencies that work like that, but there are, at least recently, some prominent private railway companies that have started operation. There’s Brightline in Florida, which is a private intercity railway line, which is, as far as I know, doing its best to develop the areas around its stations. You may be familiar with the term transit oriented development. Anyway, Brightline has taken advantage of value capture and TOD to build up its station areas. This is why they’re so interested in Miami and making sure their station location is close to downtown. Unlike the Amtrak Station, which is more peripheral. I know that Brightline is attempting to add a high speed line to Vegas from near LA. I’m not sure where that project stands. I just know that many operators have tried to do that route and the latest ones to step up to the plate are Brightline, so I wish them the best. The other one is actually a Japanese venture in America, where one of the companies that resulted from the breakup of the Japanese national railways is currently invested in developing a high speed railway line in Texas, between Dallas and Houston. In America, this is called the Texas Central Railway. It’s a subsidiary or partner company for the Central Japan Railway, which operates the busiest high speed line in Japan. The one from Tokyo to Osaka. And generally, as operations are, rural operations in Central Japan and commuter metropolitan operations around Nagoya, Japan’s third city. Tamara Winter: That’s one I’ve been hearing about for years. I didn’t realize it was a Japanese company behind that, which gives me a lot of hope for it. Alex Forrest: That has definitely improved my impression of the project as well. At the very least, I understand that the people who are working on it are technically very knowledgeable with literal decades of experience running the busiest high-speed railway in the world, whether or not that will be able to translate to Texas is still kind of anyone’s guess. But I don’t think you could find a better crew to do the job ultimately. Tamara Winter: Tell me, what do you think are the lessons and learnings for the US, as you kind of think back to your own experiences in Japan, and then now as a transit planner yourself, what do you think that US cities should aim to learn from the way that many Japanese cities operate transit? Alex Forrest: As far as learning from Japan, I’d already mentioned about planning for a general population. That’s pretty critical, but just as far as operations go, I think I would encourage them to not give up on the concept of farebox recovery. Even the most ardent transit advocates in America will frequently drop the line that there’s no transportation service that pays for itself. And this is where the reference to the Japanese providers, not only making their money from value capture is very important because usually the people who say that no system is profitable, will bring up the value capture argument to hand wave Japan’s example away, but that’s literally not true. A lot of these are publicly traded companies. You can look up their books and see where they’re getting their money from. I’d make a point to check the Odakyu Fact Book whenever they update it, which is once a year, that’s the line that I used to ride when I was a kid in the suburbs there. So we can confirm that it is indeed possible to make more than 100% of your operating costs from your fares. And the question is just, how do you do this? And there are so many ways to approach this that just don’t even get entertained because in America, they don’t think it’s an ideal worth pursuing. They don’t think there’s any finish line to that race. They think if you start focusing on your farebox recovery, you’ll never hit a 100%. You’ll waste a lot of time. You’ll have to make austere cuts on anything that isn’t profitable immediately. That’s really not how this works, really. If you’re only making 10% of your budget from fares, think about what you can do to get that to 20%. That’s not much, you don’t need to raise your fares necessarily, right? You might just need to change your fare structure. You might offer a discount on passes, which gets people to buy passes more often, which gets them to use the system more often. And then, hey, they don’t always have a pass or they might not ride the pass as much as the pass is paying for. And so you’re still making more money than if they never rode at all, right? Put it like this. If you buy a monthly pass for $50 and $50 pays for, let’s say, 30 trips on the bus, and you only use that monthly pass 20 times, transit operators has made a lot more money off those 20 trips than if they were all sold individually. And so, little steps that can be taken to improve farebox recovery. It’s not just about raising revenue, it’s also about reducing your costs. Obviously, you don’t need to change your fares at all if you can come up with a way to bring your operating costs down by, say, 5%, right? Again, it’s just that they don’t even entertain the idea that you could ever hit 100% profitability that they won’t take the smallest step in that direction. On the contrary, a lot of providers are talking now about trying to go fare free, which I admire where that’s coming from, but I can’t say that that would work out very well for us, even in the medium-term, let alone the long-term. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting because in the same way that a lot of the challenges that you see in infrastructure are not things that have a single cause, similarly, if you wanted to kind of fix sort of broken systems or even systems that are just operating suboptimally in some regard, these little changes...I wouldn’t necessarily think, "Oh, if you’re making 10% of your operating costs, maybe try and make 20 in revenue." That seems very doable. And I guess, as you look across the United States, do you see pockets of optimism? Alex Forrest: Yes. Not the least of which is my own local situation. It was nice to get a couple of routes approved. One of them’s doing badly, one of them’s doing well, but both of those were what I expected when I went into this. So I guess just things are going as expected there. Tamara Winter: Tell me again, just what did you get approved? And congratulations by the way. Alex Forrest: Oh, thank you. Thank you. And I should emphasize, I did not work on these grant proposals alone at all. So I had the collaboration of my great coworker over at PVTA, the director of planning over there. But one of the routes was a thrice per day, five days a week weekend-focused service, connecting Amherst, Mass. and Worcester Mass. The other is a roughly hourly to half hourly service along Interstate 91, between Northampton, Holyoke, at the Holyoke Mall and Downtown Springfield. Like I said a minute ago, the Springfield one has been a success. The Worcester one, not so much, but both are extremely well received. And the shortcomings of the Worcester route, I was well aware of when I went into designing the schedule with the very limited funds that were on the table. We, again, at the end of the day, only provide as much as people pay for, which is one of the reasons I think it’s so important that transit providers try to maximize their farebox revenue because the more your riders are paying for you to exist, the more you will be responding to the needs of your riders in continuing to exist. When you get all of your budget from state allocations, taxpayer funding, that money is just as good as any other money. The problem is that you have to address the concerns of the people giving it to you in order to get it. And their concerns may or may not line up with the actual interests of riders. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. The more of your money is coming from riders, the less likely you are to get paid to do something you wish you wouldn’t do, which happens all the time, I got to say. Tamara Winter: It’s a bit of a principal-agent problem. If the money isn’t coming from people that are actually using the service, it may or may not be useful. Alex Forrest: Right. Essentially, you’ll always reflect the priorities of whoever’s paying you to do your job. You want those priorities to line up with the users of your service, ideally, but as far as pockets of optimism, there are a lot. I think the thing which has had my attention the most in the past few years has been this phenomenon of bus network rationalizations. There’s a well regarded transit planner called Jarrett Walker who runs a private consulting firm, which I would say specializes in these network redesigns. Some of the fruits have been great. One of the first cities they went at was Houston. I know they’ve also done work in at least Miami, I want to say Seattle, and I want to say Rhode Island as well, at one point, or they might be doing Rhode Island now. I don’t quite recall, but these redesigns, essentially, they aim to have a cost neutral redeployment of existing resources. So you have X number of buses. You can pay X number of driver hours and X amount of fuel. Could you, just by changing where the buses are running, get a more effective system? Focusing on allowing people to transfer outside the central hub, as well as the central hub. Having services more frequent on more routes, even if that means having slightly fewer routes. The routes that you have will be higher quality. They’ll more consistently attract people to them because they’re more useful. And so this tendency doesn’t seem to be losing any steam. More and more cities are picking it up. The results have been very good where they’ve been attempted. This was pre-COVID, so I don’t know what happened after that, unfortunately, but pre-COVID, I do remember that any articles that would decry the general crisis of transit ridership in America would have to overlook Houston, which despite being a generally bus network, was actually improving its ridership at that time, while most of the country was struggling and losing ridership year after year, and it hadn’t been doing so before the redesign. So something clicked there and I want more cities to get this opportunity. I’ve taken a crack at it in my spare time, looking at our local network, but I don’t know. I feel like I’m maybe a little too in the weeds to do a good job. I’m already too accustomed to the usual special demands, special concessions, that I can’t quite bring myself to say, "Ah, well, rationally speaking, we shouldn’t do that." I know these guys too well, they’ll come yelling at me the next week if I mess it up. So it can be nice to have some outside eyes looking at it. At the same time, I think another thing that a lot of transit agencies in the US should be prioritizing more and some of them are, and doing a very good job at it, is developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors, the better you are just at the industry in general, some of these Japanese suburban railway companies, one of them in particular, happens to also be one of the largest manufacturers of rail cars in Japan. So they make trains for themselves, but also for other companies in Japan and also around the world. Again, just the more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system. It’s just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Alex, this has been honestly a delight. It’s crazy, I’ve known you for years, but I feel like I’m just meeting you again for the first time. It’s really wonderful to know that there are people working, not just in kind of the big transit systems, like in New York or in WMATA, in DC, but also in places like Springfield. And I appreciate so much that you gave us your time. Alex Forrest: No, thank you again so much for having me. It’s been a pleasure. It was great to catch up. We should definitely talk again soon.

Okay, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Archived audio Commercial: Why you eating a mint, baby? So I can kiss you on the face. Why? Because it’s National Night. What? Tamara Winter: That’s an ad for Mentos, the breath mint. It’s also kind of an ad for Singapore. It was launched in 2012 to coincide with Singapore’s National Day. Archived audio Commercial: I’m talking about making a baby, baby. You ready? Let’s go. Tamara Winter: National Day is celebrated on August 9th, the day that Singapore gained independence after separating from Malaysia. Traditionally, it’s marked by fireworks, official speeches and a massive parade. Archived audio Ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome our cabinet ministers, senior ministers and deputy prime minister to The Float @ Marina Bay. Here come our cabinet ministers streaming into the… Tamara Winter: Dignitaries wave flags and the prime minister gives a National Day address, a little bit like the State of the Union in the US. In fact, in 2012, the same year as the Mentos ad, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong discussed Singapore’s falling birth rates in his address. Archived audio Lee Hsien Loong: But alas, we are having too few babies and therefore we have a problem. The long-term trend is down, but we cannot give up. We’ve got to do something about it. Married couples are having fewer children. On average, now, each married woman has two kids. Previously, it was more, so this number has also been coming down. Tamara Winter: So, Mentos to the rescue? Archived audio Commercial: It’s National Night. Let’s make Singapore’s birth rate spike. Birth rate ain’t going to spike itself. Singapore’s population, it needs some increasing. Tamara Winter: In the US, we aren’t used to ads like that, or to hearing politicians talk about these issues in the way that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong does, even though similar trends are at work here. The birth rate in the United States is also falling. Personally, I’ve always been drawn to these questions about populations. Birth rates, changes in the age of a population and what those numbers might mean. It always felt like a natural fascination to me. See, I grew up in a large family, and when I say large, I mean large. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you I don’t even know precisely how many cousins I have, and that’s just first cousins. Who knows how many second or third cousins I’ve got running around out there? And even though I haven’t met all of my cousins yet—they’re scattered across a few continents—I feel extremely fortunate to have an international support system that spans generations. I also want to have my own kids someday. And by the standards of most people my age, I want to have a lot of kids. But of course, the decision to have children is intensely personal. It’s also one that governments around the world try to influence in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. So I wanted to understand what impact these kinds of personal decisions can have at scale, and why governments have so often tried to influence their citizens when it comes to having children. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press, exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. So far on the podcast, we’ve looked at a lot of physical infrastructure: housing, transportation, cities, container ships. But why do we need all this infrastructure in the first place? People. It all comes down to people. So, in this episode, we’re looking at how a country’s population, its size, its growth or lack of growth, are perhaps the most critical infrastructure. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about populations. What happens when governments try to influence population growth and size through policy? Countries around the world put policies in place that influence their citizens’ reproductive choices. The United Nations Department of World Economic and Social Affairs keeps track of these policies. In 2021, their report listed 143 governments with fertility policies intended to either raise, lower or maintain population size. For example, Kenya has had government-led efforts to slow population growth since the 1960s. These programs, which began by providing basic contraception and family-planning information, evolved into healthcare systems for mothers and infants. By contrast, Hungary has recently made headlines for a distinctly different goal. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has spoken openly about wanting to raise Hungary’s birth rate, which is among the lowest in Europe. In 2015, the Family Housing Allowance Program created subsidies that increased based on whether a couple was married and how many children they had. The most benefits were available to married couples with three or more children. But Hungary has actually had policies in place to raise birth rates since the late 1940s. One country that has tried to both speed up and slow down its population growth through policy is Singapore, first by discouraging citizens from having large families and now by pursuing pro-fertility policies. So with that Mentos ad still ringing in my ears, I set out to understand what it was like to live with these ever-changing policies. How did people having kids in Singapore experience their government’s evolving attitudes towards procreation? Titus: My name is Titus. I’m 69 years old now. I have been in the government service for 25 years with the Housing and Development Board in Singapore. So that’s a little bit about me, and my wife and I, we have three children. Vimala: I’m Vimala and I’ve been a teacher all my life, taught for about 30 years, 35 years. Titus: We’re both born in Singapore and we have lived here for all our lives. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala have seen both sides of Singapore’s policy on family planning. Vimala: We lived through the times when we had this policy of “Stop-at-Two” family planning. Tamara Winter: After World War II, Singapore’s population was rising rapidly, much faster than its economy was developing. Even the introduction of family planning in the 1940s didn’t slow it down. In 1950, the population was barely more than one million. But by the time of independence in 1965, it was almost 1.9 million, close to double. Add to that, Singapore is a tiny island nation. It’s just 281 square miles. For comparison, the city of Los Angeles is about 500 square miles. A booming population, little room for expansion. So by the early 1970s, the government took action. Titus: You know, during our teenage years, I think the Stop-at-Two policy started somewhere the early ’70s. Tamara Winter: 1972. Titus: And we were our teenage years at that time. Vimala: No, it was early twenties. Titus: In our twenties, sorry. We were in our twenties at that time. That’s the purpose of the policy, to reeducate you on what is right and then what is wrong. I thought it was quite intuitive as well. One child, the child will be lonely. Two children, okay, he’s got a playmate. Three, if some mistakes are made then you have three. Tamara Winter: The Stop-at-Two policy, a combination of incentives and disincentives for families. Vimala: We got married in 1980. So my first child was born in ‘81, and after I gave birth immediately, I think the next day, the nurse comes to me and asks me, "What plans do you have for family planning?" So it was very strict at that time, and they wanted us to keep at two. So if you stopped at two, you had a lot of incentives. Like, they got us at places where it mattered a lot to us, which was the housing and health. If you had two children, both the children would get X number of dollars in school for them. But if you had a third child, then the third child would have nothing, that sort of thing. Titus: So you had to fund it yourself. Vimala: Yeah. Tamara Winter: Along with the policies came an aggressive PR campaign. Vimala: Maybe it was kind of a propaganda. There were campaigns, and very sadly, you’re told, "Two is enough," and "Because of two, you get X number of things." And so after a while, and we were young at that time, maybe in our late teens, early twenties, and then you start to see that, eh, it makes sense. Actually, I remember this poster very, very vividly in my mind with the father, mother and two daughters. And they say, "Boy or girl, two is enough." Tamara Winter: And those posters were inescapable. Titus: Once you have a government policy, the posters are everywhere, in government offices. Vimala: Bus stops. Titus: Public places, bus stops. Vimala: Yeah. Malls, everywhere. They just have different versions of it, but the idea is the same. Tamara Winter: Some other posters from the time directly promoted more drastic measures like sterilization, calling it "the best method for family limitation." Vimala: So if you stopped at two and if you sterilized yourself, the lady, she could get the best school for her child, whichever school she wanted for her child. And also the family could stay in some of the better areas in Singapore. So it was a very serious thing then, and most people adhered to that policy of "keep at two." Titus: Some of the ladies, actually, were sterilized, though of course, they took the more drastic action to stop at two. Many years later, when the government started encouraging people to have more children, there were some bad feelings that, "You had actually prevented me from having more children and now you’re telling me to have more children." So there were some of these undercurrents. Tamara Winter: So the Stop-at-Two policy in Singapore was more than just economic. Sterilizations took place on a mass scale with a peak of more than 10,000 procedures carried out in 1976. The Stop-at-Two policy was far from the only effort to limit population growth in developing countries. China’s one-child policy, which was put in place in 1980, is probably the most well known, but countries like India also put similar policies in place as far back as the early 1950s. But these kinds of policies often came at a heavy cost. One that has disproportionately impacted women. In Singapore, mothers, afraid they might be unable to bear the costs of a third child, were forced to make permanent, life-altering choices about their bodies. This was also the case on a much larger scale in China. Millions of women were sterilized as part of the government’s efforts at population control. Others were forced to undergo abortions. In some rural areas where there was a long-standing preference for male children, female infants were abandoned. And as a result, in China today it’s estimated that there are nearly 35 million more men than women. In economically-developed countries, the notion of having fewer children by choice gained traction, starting in the late 1960s, sometimes with an environmental argument attached. This anxiety about the world’s growing population was in large part because of one extremely popular book written by a husband-and-wife team. Archived audio Johnny Carson: It was about 10 years ago this month that Dr. Paul Ehrlich made his first appearance on the Tonight Show, and it elicited probably more mail than any guest at that time we have ever had on a show. It had to do with his book, The Population Bomb, and it was a major factor in launching the ZPG, which is zero population growth in this country. And since that show, he’s done about 25 shows with us. Tamara Winter: The Population Bomb, coauthored by Paul and Anne Ehrlich, was a sensation. Published in 1968, it predicted famine, drought and mass death due to overpopulation, all within the next 20 years. These ideas weren’t entirely new. Economist Thomas Malthus made a similar case in his 1798 book, _An Essay on the Principle of Populatio_n. But it was Ehrlich’s writing that brought these concepts to a broad, contemporary audience. Some paperback copies of The Population Bomb carried the typewritten warning, "While you are reading these words, four people will have died from starvation, most of them, children." Ehrlich’s argument, "Let’s make sure that the existing population cannot just survive but thrive before worrying about adding more people to the planet." Here he is in 1980. Archived audio Paul Ehrlich: We have a little over four billion today. Large numbers of them are undernourished. We don’t have enough energy to go around. People think the environment is deteriorating and so on. Why don’t we try doing a really good job with four billion people, see if we can do that? Tamara Winter: The legacy of this book, for better or for worse, lives on today. In 2019, a statement on the need for climate action, endorsed by over 11,000 scientists, was published in the Journal of Bioscience. One of the statements’ recommendations: stop global population growth. Now, the methods of population limitation proposed in this statement were mainly about personal choice, like increasing access to family planning services. They were not advocating restrictive government policies, but the anxieties that Ehrlich brought to mainstream attention are present. So I wanted to know, what is the state of population growth like today? I called up Clara Piano. Clara Piano: Alright. So my name is Clara Piano. I am currently an assistant professor of quantitative analysis at Samford University. My area of research is family economics, although I’ve also published in the history of economic thought and the economics of religion. Tamara Winter: In addition to being an expert on family economics, when we talked, she was also about to become a mom. Clara Piano: Yes, yes. I am eight months along with our first. She’s a little girl, and it has convinced me that no one is ever ready. I just really do feel like it’s been a privilege to not only be researching what I find most interesting, which is how families form and function and interact with society, but to be living it right now as well. Tamara Winter: So I asked her: is the world’s population still growing? Clara Piano: The world’s population is increasing, although much less than it was in the past. Tamara Winter: World population growth reached a peak in the 1960s. Since then, it has fallen. And within the next 100 years, the world’s population is actually projected to shrink. Researchers like Clara are keeping a close eye on these global trends because unlike Erlich, they see potential in a growing population. When we talked, she referenced the work of economist Julian Simon. Clara Piano: As Julian Simon would say, the ultimate resource is people. And of course, there are values of people beyond economics. I want to acknowledge that completely, and he does as well in his work. But basically, it comes down to the fact that people are not only hands. They also have brains and they have ideas, and population growth, even from the economic perspective, is not just a replication process but a diversification process. So the people who are being born now are going to have different ideas of how to do things that will generate technological progress, which is actually the source of economic growth. Tamara Winter: This is another view of population growth also captured by economist Michael Kremer in his 1990 paper, Population Growth and Technological Change. The paper is worth reading in full, but the takeaway is that as populations increase, so does technological advancement, which in turn increases economic growth, and more concretely, raises living standards. So population growth can possibly be a key to solving the existential challenges that Erlich described: like food and energy scarcity, and climate change. The theory goes, if there are more people out there trying to solve big problems, more possible solutions can be found. Shruti Rajagopalan: You live in New York City, right? That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, where ideas multiply. That’s what we really need. Tamara Winter: That’s Shruti Rajagopalan. Shruti Rajagopalan: I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emergent Ventures grants program also at Mercatus. I’m a fellow of the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU Law School because, in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. Tamara Winter: Her research on developing economies is rooted in India, a country with a massive and growing population. Shruti Rajagopalan: So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of a hard number to even imagine. The United States, for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people. So the Indian population is 18% of the world. Tamara Winter: India is projected to surpass China as the most populous country in the world within the next decade. While a growing population can put stress on a nation’s infrastructure, Shruti sees India’s numbers as one of its greatest assets. Shruti Rajagopalan: India already has the resources of a large number of people. Now we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other. The ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce, globally, is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: But not all countries are growing so rapidly, and some aren’t growing at all. So the fundamental question remains: how to ensure that people can have the number of children they want to have. Here’s Clara Piano. Clara Piano: So this is the billion-dollar question. There is an element of mystery about all of this, in terms of the declining populations around the world. However, there are some things that we know. We do know that as people have become more educated, particularly women, we see lower fertility, and this could be a variety of reasons. Some people think it’s better knowledge about family spacing, fertility decisions. I, from an economic perspective, the most compelling reason for me seems to be that just the opportunity of the cost of their time increases. Tamara Winter: With the kinds of economic benefits that Clara and Shruti describe in mind, by the mid 1980s, Singapore was changing its policies. Titus: The reversal in policy to have more children came in 1986. I think. Tamara Winter: It was in 1986 that the policy officially changed. As a snarky headline in the New York Times put it, "Singapore decides it wants lots of children after all." But the policy change didn’t happen overnight. Titus: 1984, the thinking was already quite clear. They started this graduate-mother scheme, graduate-mother policy, where if you are a graduate mother, you get more incentives— Vimala: School, education. Titus: For education for your children, tax incentives, including subsidy for even hiring a foreign maid. These were some of the incentives that were given for graduate mothers to go out and work, and also to have more children. At that time, anyway, there was a belief that smart women produce smart children. Tamara Winter: The shift wasn’t just from Stop-at-Two to, everyone have as many kids as you can. The new policy slogan was: have three or more, if you can afford it. And even then, the government preference was for highly-educated women to be the ones having children. The slogan and program were a little harder to distill in a soundbite than Stop-at-Two. It also had to convince a generation that grew up with Stop-at-Two messaging. Vimala: Among my siblings, we’re the only two who have three kids. All the rest have two. Even my brother, who married twice with each wife, he had two children. So it’s just like, "Oh, that’s the best number. It makes sense." Tamara Winter: When thinking about the intuitive power of Stop-at-Two, Vimala recalls a family night out at a restaurant. Vimala: When I had my second daughter, she kept telling us, "Oh, four of us, that’s just fine." I still remember we were at the restaurant, she said, "You see, there’s a table for four? That’s just nice for us." And so when I told her I was having my third one, she wasn’t happy at all because she felt that was really not the plan. So I think all of us had that in mind. We are very subtle... there’s subtle messages that they sent to us. Tamara Winter: Skeptical parents were only one of the barriers to Singapore’s new policy efforts. Another force was at work, a result of the country’s rapid economic growth over the years that the Stop-at-Two policy was in place. In the field of demography—the study of human populations—one of the major concepts is what’s called the “demographic transition.” This is the name for a phenomenon that has been observed in virtually every country around the world: it describes the shift within a country from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth rates and low death rates. There's an ongoing debate about what exactly causes this transition. Social and economic development—things like improved sanitation and better education, especially for women and girls—are correlated with declining fertility and increased longevity. The result: a more slowly growing population and an aging one, sometimes even one that shrinks. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, Singapore’s economic development was rapid, moving it further along the journey to, you guessed it, demographic transition. Since then, Singapore’s population has continued to grow, but the rate of growth has slowed and is projected to continue falling for the foreseeable future. So what does it mean to have an aging or declining population? Well, for starters the costs of supporting such a population can strain national budgets. And put more financial pressure on younger working-age people to support the elderly. Both individually and through expanding social programs. There’s also quite a lot of evidence that aging populations are less dynamic. And more hostile to new ideas. So as Singapore was going through its own demographic transition, it decided to work against the trend with policies that encouraged fertility. Some thinkers are encouraging economically developed countries to fight the demographic transition. To understand more about why Singapore and other countries are concerned about slowing population growth rates, I called up Matt Yglesias. Matthew Yglesias: I’m Matthew Yglesias. I write a newsletter called Slow Boring. I’m a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center, and I wrote a book recently called One Billion Americans. Tamara Winter: If you’re on Twitter, you probably didn’t need that introduction. The full title of his book is One Billion Americans: The Case For Thinking Bigger. And Yglesias certainly thinks big when it comes to the United States population. Matthew Yglesias: In some way, the population is the most important infrastructure of all. We’re talking about tripling the population density of the United States in this book. That would put us on a par with France. We’d be at about half the density of Germany. Most of the country is not unspoiled wilderness. It just has room for more people in it. Tamara Winter: He argues that a larger population in the United States would be beneficial to more than just technological development. Matthew Yglesias: I think it also matters for innovation and for culture that, part of the strength of the United States is that a lot of people come here to try to pursue their biggest dreams. And that can be technology entrepreneurs. It’s also movie directors. Like, if you do really well in New Zealand cinema, you get to go make a movie in America because we have a big audience, we have a big enterprise here. Tamara Winter: That New Zealand cinema example feels especially on point. Just a week ago, while we were finishing this episode, the biggest movie in the world was Thor: Love and Thunder, directed by Taika Waititi, who got a start making indie movies in New Zealand and had his international breakout with a mockumentary about vampire flatmates in Wellington. Now he’s in Hollywood making Marvel movies and scheduled to write and direct a Star Wars film. In his writing, Yglesias brings up a particular statistic, that many women in the United States end up having fewer children than they say they want. Matthew Yglesias: What’s interesting, though, is that in the ’70s, there was a really big decline in how many children American women said they wanted to have. For the past 20 years, you have not seen that decline in intended fertility, but actual completed fertility has kept ticking downwards. Tamara Winter: Listening to Yglesias, I was reminded that Clara Piano, who we heard from earlier on this episode, made a similar point. Clara Piano: Educated women in developed countries, in particular, have the highest fertility gaps, which essentially means that, although they say when they’re around age 25, "I’d like to have, maybe, three children," on average they end up having two. So that’s a pretty big gap and it’s, for me, a signal that there’s something going on that we don’t really understand. Tamara Winter: So what can governments do? Clara offers an answer that touches on some of the physical infrastructure discussed in previous episodes of this podcast. Clara Piano: At the end of the day, I think that, really, just the best way to think about this is to increase freedom quite literally. Because women and men, in general, are saying, "I would like to have more children." There are some barriers that are preventing them from having children, and so just basic things like increasing economic freedom, labor mobility, freeing up people to fulfill their plans, whether or not that’s economic or for their families. For housing, to be able to move and to increase the supply of housing so we can have rooms for the children. These are more promising approaches. Tamara Winter: So what does this look like in practice? The promising approaches Clara mentions point towards options beyond government policies aimed at directly encouraging or discouraging citizens from having kids. Maybe the problem is that people are being prevented from having the number of children they say they want because of rising costs of living, housing, social support, or any number of other pressures. So while building more housing, further expanding the child tax credit, increasing labor mobility, ensuring paid maternity and paternity leave, and promoting workplace flexibility might not solve every problem—I think they're policies worth pursuing anyway. Back in Singapore, Titus and Vimala ended up having three children. And though their third was born after the Stop-at-Two policy ended, there were still challenges and a lack of support. Vimala: When I had my third child in 1990, I had no maternity leave or whatever. I didn’t get a salary for two months if I decided to go on leave. Tamara Winter: Luckily, they have the kind of financial stability that allowed them to feel comfortable having a third child. Titus: Well, for us, actually, we were about to get married. Our idea was we would have children and, of course, at that time it had been ingrained in us two children. That was proper number to have. Even if we had three, we did not have an issue with that. We had our two children. First child was born in ’81, second one in ’85. And then, five years later, we were blessed with a third daughter. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala are both well educated and have stable jobs. The financial incentives and disincentives of the Stop-at-Two and have-three-or-more-if-you-can policies were a part of their lives, but they didn’t have to change their family planning decisions because of them. Today, they have three grown daughters with families of their own. Vimala: My mother was maybe my role model. My mom was a housewife and she worked, she was a very hard-working housewife, so I used her as, "Okay, I want to be a bit like her also." Because I read a lot, I’m a literature teacher, teacher of English and literature, so for me, having three girls, I tried to impart quite a lot of things that I enjoyed in my life to them, like poetry and taking them to plays. Seeing them come full-circle, like having their own families, I think that in itself is a joy. Titus: Yeah. I suppose when they were young, of course, there’s the joy as they developed and progressed. Achievements in school, achievements in other areas of art or whatever. That brings joy to us. And as my wife said, when they found their life partners, you know… Tamara Winter: Reflecting on the various policy programs he’s seen over the last 50 years in Singapore, Titus remains optimistic about the country and the future. Titus: We have lived in a fairly strict country. The standard of living is reasonably good. Salaries are reasonably good. And I think we are quite happy to have been born and living in Singapore. Tamara Winter: And Singapore continues to promote policies that support families that have more children. In 2008, paid maternity leave was increased to 16 weeks. And in 2013, one week of paid paternity leave was added. The government also offers tax breaks, housing subsidies, and even cash payments. Maybe this set of incentives will be enough on its own, or maybe, in 2022, the government will still be looking for all the help it can get and we’ll see a return of the Mentos ad. As we’ve been researching and preparing this episode, I’ve been saying that this one is for the mothers, because when it comes to decisions about having kids, the people who carry them for nine months are often the ones who pay the highest price, physically and economically. And I hope to be one of those people. So while it’s easy to get lost in the economic theory or the global-level demographic statistics, this is personal for me. And so many aspiring parents around the world. And very, very real. The kinds of policies we’ve been talking about in this episode could directly impact my life when I have kids of my own. Vimala didn’t receive paid time off to have her third child. The United States, where I will likely have my children one day, is one of the only industrialized nations that does not have a national standard for paid family leave. But what years of research into the causes of declining fertility rates have demonstrated is that economic policies, even very generous ones, aren’t necessarily enough to move the needle on birth rates. Extended families, communities and other layers of social support also really matter. They certainly did for my family. And at least in my circles, this fact is increasingly acknowledged. Some of my friends are even making concrete plans to raise their children together. So I’m hopeful. Hopeful that there can be policies and social structures in place that ensure everyone has the freedom to make their own independent choices about how, when and with whom to have children.

This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the most recent episode of the podcast, you heard a brief snippet of my interview with Shruti Rajagopalan. She is a Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center and leads the Indian political economy research program and Emergent Ventures India at Mercatus. In our conversation we discuss not only the economic implications of India’s population growth, but also she gives personal insights into India’s history, sharing some of her experiences growing up in socialist India and witnessing its economic transformation firsthand. So here is my conversation with Shruti Rajagopalan which has been lightly edited. I’m going to have you first introduce yourself and your relevant affiliations. Shruti Rajagopalan: That is relatively easy. I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emerging Ventures Grants program, also at Mercatus. I’m a Fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU law school, because in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. I host a podcast called the Ideas of India, which is an attempt to bridge the gap between academic ideas and political economy, real world problems in India. And my main area of research is writing about Indian political economy, more specifically, my training is in public choice economics, law and economics, constitutional economics. I’m a very classic George Mason University trained economist. So, that’s all my affiliations, I think. Tamara Winter: Wow, is what I’ll say. Wow. Shruti, I want to start off with some context about India. So, how big is India, both in size and population? And I’m curious, for somebody who doesn’t have an immediate picture of how large India is, how does it compare to the rest of the world? So I think it’s something like 17% of the world’s population? Shruti Rajagopalan: Exactly. So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of hard number to even imagine, right. The United States for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people, right. So, the Indian population is 18% of the world. Having said that, India is a very young country, right. So the median age is about three to four years lower than most developing countries and much lower than the developed Western world, which has an aging population. It’s the second largest country, in terms of population and barring natural disaster or existential risk, nuclear war, asteroid hit, it’s likely to be the most populous country in the world. It’s the sixth largest economy just because the size is so large. I think nominal GDP is about 2.7 trillion US dollars, something like that. Having said that, in terms of GDP per capita, it’s still relatively a low to middle income country. It’s about $2,000 GDP per capita. Just as a point of comparison, China is about 5X the GDP per capita of India. South Korea is about 15X, right. And the United States is about 30X. So, in terms of being rich, it’s great to have a very large country, but it’s even more important that it’s a very large number of people who are also very, very prosperous. Tamara Winter: I actually want to add one more question for context. So, I was born in Nigeria, we’ve talked about this a little bit and I saw a tweet forever ago, basically pointing out the futility of talking about a country like Nigeria as though it were one country, something like 200 different ethnic groups within the country. And I wonder to what extent is this also true of India? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. I mean, I think Nigeria and India are great examples of this kind of diversity, but also how difficult it is to paint the country in one color. So just as an example, Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest state in India, it’s the size of Brazil. The smallest state in India, Sikkim, is closer to the size of Bhutan, which is like a really small Himalayan Kingdom country, right. India’s richest states like Goa, which is a great place. All the tourists love to go to Goa. It has a GDP per capita closer to Jordan, right. And India’s poorer state, Bihar is closer to Haiti. So, that’s basically the difference, right. And there are some Southern states like Kerala, which have...great on human indicators, 100% literacy rates. Again, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are relatively poor, they’re barely at the halfway mark. And in terms of linguistic diversity, there are 18 or 19 official languages, but they’re technically thousands of dialects. Very similar to Nigeria in this sense. The caste system is another point of fragmentation. There’s a lot of religious fragmentation, of course. Hindus are the majority in terms of population, about 83%, but it’s about 13, 14% Muslims, right. It’s one of the largest Islamic countries in terms of absolute numbers. I think it’s the second largest. So, in terms of religious diversity, caste diversity, ethnic diversity, it’s really, really big. You’d love this, the Cambridge economist, Joan Robinson, she once said that, "The frustrating thing about India is whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true." And I think this is really true also of Nigeria, in the sense, right. Anything you can say about one tribe, you can get the exact opposite example in another end of the country in a different state, in a different city. So I think that point is very well taken. So India, when we say...it’s just, I’m talking about a geographical boundary and a state entity and a certain kind of common culture, a democratic framework, those are things that hold Indians together, but you’re right. We got to get specific really quickly with countries like India. Tamara Winter: Well, now that we’ve said that, we’re going to zoom back out then. For anybody who hasn’t read How India Can Use Its Numbers, your excellent article, could you maybe summarize the argument and tell folks the context in which it appeared? Shruti Rajagopalan: I grew up in socialist India and at that time, the economic rates of growth were relatively low, but population was growing really quickly, because post World War II, with all the advances in medicine and infectious diseases or battling infectious diseases, suddenly you saw infant mortality drop, you saw people living much longer lives. There’s this huge boom in population. But if the size of the economic pie is not growing, it means you’re basically redistributing the same size of the pie with more and more people. So in this context, it becomes very easy to have a Malthusian point of view, which is people are the problem, right. Wherever you look, you think in terms of zero sum games, because that’s how socialist economies operate. There isn’t a positive sumness that comes from create and openness, but also, all the infrastructure is crumbling, right. There are too many people. Every time you need to get on a bus, you see that you got to elbow 15 people to even get on a bus, right. Or school admissions, right. Every single basic public service that you use, whether it’s roads congestion, whether it’s water runs out the moment you go to the public well or the public tap. So these kinds of problems led people to blame population and the government intervened in so many different ways. At one point, even policy called for sterilizations during the undemocratic time of the emergency. But usually, more benign ways of essentially reducing the population, right. And this has led to, I think, a basic misconception. We need to bring the focus back now that India has liberalized and now it’s actually a trading economy, it’s plugged into the global economy, that more people are actually a good thing, right. So as Julian Simon said that, "People are the ultimate resource." right. And why do we think people are the ultimate resource? I think that’s the insight which is a little bit harder for people who come from the Malthusian point of view. And this comes to why or where we think economic growth comes from, right. And it’s not coming from just more physical resources. Economic growth comes from new ideas. Tamara Winter: We take for granted the idea that having a large population is beneficial. You and I are doing this interview in the United States. You’re from India, I’m from Nigeria. So I’ll ask you directly, why is having a large population beneficial? Shruti Rajagopalan: This is a great question and it’s unintuitive to most people, right. Because most people just think, "Oh, there are more mouths to feed," right. Especially in socialist economies or developing countries, but economists and more and more economists who worked on growth theories, whether it’s Paul Romer or Michael Kremer, right. Their idea is that the central or the key to economic growth is new ideas, right. New ideas are more important than just some form of capital, physical capital or labor or something else, right. Once you recognize the power of ideas, the value of the population comes into focus, right. People, especially well educated people, healthy populations, smart, creative people in a space where they’re constantly bumping into each other, are the source of not just new ideas, but also how to combine these new ideas into more and more and more applications and that is really where economic growth comes from. And this is not just true of today’s tech economy or Silicon Valley or something very specific, right. Michael Kremer has this great paper, it’s called Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990. This is a generalized trend for all of human history. And you can even see this, you go to small island countries for tourism or something like that, you’ve seen that these populations can tend to stagnate. They need outside people to come in and trade with them all the time, otherwise they do stagnate, right. Whereas large connected populations, you live in New York City, right. That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, right. Where ideas multiply. Matt Ridley has a great phrase, he says, "Where ideas can have sex," right. That’s what we really need, right. So now fortunately, India already has the resources of a large number of people, right. Now, we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other, their ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce globally is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: Shruti, in your article, you identified, I think it was three policy areas in which a large population could, if utilized well or if allowed to flourish, could really unlock other gains. What were those policy areas? Shruti Rajagopalan: Yeah, so I’ll tell you a little bit about India before jumping into the policy prescription, because I think it’s important to also specify the problem. So, as I said, the people exist in India, right. And India thankfully, is a democratic country with free movement, so that is a wonderful thing, unlike China, right. That’s the closest example of a country which has large numbers of people, but they’re not allowed free movement, free assembly and so on. But in India, there are a few really major problems. The first is that India’s internal market is completely fragmented. One of the reasons the United States has been such a huge economic success is the United States was one of the first and largest free trade zones. You can trade anywhere within the United States. That never quite happened for India because states had a lot of different taxation regimes. They used to have internal tariff regimes. If you’re shipping apples or banana chips from one state to another state, you have to not only pay tariffs and taxes, but the differential tariffs and taxes come with a lot of corruption, long lines at highways where bureaucrats and corrupt inspectors can extract lots of bribes from you. That was the economy, and that naturally fragments the economy into smaller and smaller parts. And the greatest losers in this are obviously the poorer states, right. Because they’re kind of getting cut out of the market. So the number one thing is how to make sure that India’s internal market stays unified. So for this, the Indian government already took one step, which is unifying the tax regime, right, from this splintered, many-state system to a unified value added tax, it’s called the goods and services tax, but they did it the Indian way. It has eight different tax rates. It’s very complex, it’s a complete mess. So, if they streamline that, that’s going to be a huge improvement. India also needs far better infrastructure and this is where the good news is. We know that if India unifies a single market, there’s going to be so much more trade and therefore, so much more revenue for the government that actually, the additional infrastructure is just going to pay for itself, right. It’s not a net loss to build more roads, right. Or to build more ports or railways and transportation systems, coal storage, warehousing. These are things that will pay for themselves, so that’s one major part of it. The second is India’s labor market is a complete disaster, right. And this is, again, goes back to the socialist history of...there are just about, I think 40 or 50 federal level labor laws and regulation, and every state has its own rules and own regulation, which means at any given point, if you’re a countrywide firm, you have to follow 200, 300 different codes of regulation. And there’s a labor inspection system, which is of course, very corrupt and can completely extract rents, but what that does is it makes it very costly to hire people in a labor surplus economy, which is a terrible, terrible thing. And therefore, and you’ll be familiar with this from the Nigerian experience, it gets pushed into the informal market. And what I mean by the informal market is that it’s basically just escaping taxes and regulation, right. There’s nothing poor quality of the informal market. My engagement ring, I’m showing it to Tammy right now, comes from the informal market, right. So you can have very high quality, very, very expensive jewelry, leather goods, artwork, all this manufacturing happening in the shadow of India’s regulation. And what that does is it doesn’t allow it to scale, right. When things can’t formalize, they can’t get access to credit. And more importantly, in the labor market, people can’t get gainfully employed in sensible jobs that are salaried. They’re basically working daily wage labor, right. So this really needs to get fixed. 80% of India works in the informal economy. So they need to be brought back in a way out of the shadows, into the light. And the only way to do that is to deregulate in a meaningful way, countrywide, so that it becomes very easy to hire labor and it becomes very easy for actually people to invest and develop their skills. And the third thing is India, for its state of development, got connected to the internet, right, very, very quickly. This has again, got something to do with its numbers, right. When you need to lay the pipes, right. Or to put down the infrastructure for internet or telecom connectivity, a very large size market helps, right. Because very large number of subscribers means that you can put in the capital expenditure required to lay the pipes. So in India, that happened really quickly. I believe 816 million people are connected to a mobile phone in India. So it has fantastic mobile phone penetration. I think three out of four households has at least one phone. So the household has access. And that means that...and data is so cheap in India that I believe at one point someone was telling me, I met someone who used to work at HBO and they told me that Game of Thrones is super popular in India, though, it never launched by then. Everyone was watching it on torrent or something because data and streaming is so cheap in India that HBO decided that, "Okay, this is a very large market. We need to simultaneously start releasing this in India because there’s this huge fan base." So I think because India got connected, a lot of the network goods as we call them, this is platforms, right. Especially...I mean, you work at Stripe, so you completely understand what I’m talking about, but even more basic, like Twitter, Facebook, any kind of platform good, Uber, all this has a massive market potentially in India, right. People should get used to how you and I speak because more and more stuff on Netflix is going to sound like you and me, right. Because that’s where the eyeballs are going to come from in the future. So I think this is an underappreciated insight and for some things, you just need more eyeballs, right. For things like subscription services, for things like Twitter. For some things, you also need purchasing power. So as India gets richer, then more people are also going to use Stripe Press, right. Not just Stripe, right. As India gets more educated. So I think this is an insight that’s really valuable. So these are three areas where massive amount of investment is going to help India in a meaningful way. Tamara Winter: I’m curious about the 1991 reforms in India and what effect they had on the Indian economy. Shruti Rajagopalan: Oh, this is great question and my current passion project. So, I should plug this because we run a project called the 1991 Project at the Mercatus Center right now. It started last year in July on the 30th anniversary of the reforms and the website is the1991project.com. So basically, India was a socialist economy and was increasingly growing more and more socialist, since let’s say about World War II until 1990. That meant that India was basically hugely impoverished, right. And there were years or decades when the rate of economic growth didn’t even keep up with population growth, right. So there were years of negative GDP per capita growth. And this was obviously not sustainable, but in the late ’80s and early ’90s, what actually brought the country to crisis was a balance of payments problem, right. India simply did not have enough currency to afford its huge imports, especially its oil imports and energy imports, and it didn’t export enough, right. It didn’t have enough foreign exchange. So it was this crazy economy where a lot of short term debt and ballooning interest payments, which could basically topple the currency and therefore, in a meaningful way, bring down macroeconomic stability. So something had to be done. And those years, the IMF and World Bank used to have something called the Washington Consensus and they would have this long list of prescriptions for countries who were going through this macroeconomic crisis. We’ve known about this in the East Asian countries or Latin American countries. India had had similar talks and exchanges before with the World Bank and IMF when this didn’t succeed, but in 1991, something very curious and interesting had happened. A lot of the people who were in the Indian government at that time had gone and seen the growth miracle in South Korea, in Taiwan, in Singapore, right. They had been to Western countries. They had worked at the World Bank and IMF as technocrats. They had studied in American universities and they brought back this idea that, "Hang on, markets and trade are not such a terrible thing." So there was a major shift away from these hard entrant socialist values towards, "We need to open up trade." So what India did in 1991, I’ll give you the Cliff Notes version and those who are deeply interested can go to the website, is it reduced import tariffs, it devalued its currency, right, in a meaningful way, and when I say reduced import tariffs, I mean, some of the average rate of tariffs was I think 155% and the highest tariff rate was over 350%, right. So it started bringing those down in a sensible way, so now people could actually import, and this is again, not so intuitive. If you can import better, you can export cheaper, because your imports just became more efficient and higher quality and so on. So India’s total, entire chunk of trade as a part of GDP started increasing. India started getting richer. But on the other hand, another major reform that happened was India had crazy industrial licensing. The kinds that you read in economic textbooks that are talking about the socialist calculation problem. The Indian Planning Commission would tell its industrialists or entrepreneurs, how many bicycles they can produce, how many Vespas they can produce, right. How much paper can be produced or printed in a given year? So this import controlled economy where they were told what they can produce basically became a shortages scarcity economy, right. Long lines for everything. Overnight, industrial licensing was completely eliminated in India by end of July 1991, except a few select industries where they controlled some things. This basically...I mean, now you say that, "Oh, you can produce as many bicycles as people are willing to buy?" And you can imagine the gains that just unleashes, right. So these were some of the reforms that happened that brought India out of a very strictly controlled economy, internally and externally, and integrated it to the global market. And I’m a huge beneficiary of it. At the time, I was seven, eight years old when the reforms happen and overnight, I went from choice between two chocolate brands, which weren’t even that good, now there were dozens of different kinds of chocolates I could eat, right. And Michael Jackson, who my sister adored and I adored, used to drink Pepsi, and now, we could get a Michael Jackson CD, right. We could buy a CD player and we could get Pepsi, which is what he used to drink. So my memory of liberalization is also very visceral, right. Even as a kid, I knew that something major’s happening and my life is so much better. Of course, I come from a very privileged, upper middle class background, but for poorer people, it meant shortages and lines went away. When they’re standing in line for their rations, now they’re no longer getting terrible quality. Now, they’re actually getting good quality rations or they’re getting better t-shirts to wear because they were imported from China or Taiwan, right. I mean their clothing bill just got cheaper, when people are very poor, that matters. So at every level, right. It brought this huge change in India and we’re working on a year long project. We are recording oral histories with technocrats. We’re trying to understand why these ideas changed. We’re trying to show the growth that it unleashed. India went from an economy that was growing at 3% or 4% to an economy that eventually started growing at 7, 8%. And for 25 years, India grew...sustained at about 6 to 7% on average per annum, and it has lifted 270 million people out of poverty, right. That’s the size of...it’s like creating a new prosperous country almost, right. That’s an extraordinary achievement. So, I think the 1991 reforms, after Indian independence from colonial powers, if there is one major thing that’s happened in India to make everyone’s life better, globally and for Indians, it would probably be that moment. Tamara Winter: I mean, that’s incredible and I encourage anybody listening to go to the 1991 Project and also, to keep following your work. Could you speak a little bit more to how the Indian government reacted to perceived overpopulation? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. So, it started in a benign way, right. It initially started with education programs. We need to tell people to have fewer kids and that sort of thing. And a lot of those educational programs were linked to women’s health, right. This is a huge stress on women, right. This kind of reproductive stress. Then, there were campaigns that encouraged more people to adopt birth control or use condoms and things like that, right. So at that stage, and this is all pre-AIDS, right. So this is not use condoms for safer sex, this is use condoms to birth fewer children, right. So this was what was going on in the heyday of socialism under Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who was then prime minister, at one point, India suddenly moved from a democratic to an authoritarian regime for about 22 months. This was the famous episode of the Indian emergency. So India called a national level emergency and civil liberties were completely disrupted or no longer guaranteed and the government became very oppressive, right. The entire opposition of India was jailed. One of the major policy programs at that time, which her son initiated in her name, was for sterilization. And they would just capture young men, young military age men, peak reproductive age rather, and they would take them away to these clinics and make them forcibly have this procedure. So it was just crazy for a little while, right. And it was obviously a hugely unpopular move. It went away immediately after the emergency. India has never done anything that terrible since the late 70s, but it did happen. Now, I want to talk for a minute about some of the unintended consequences. So in a poor country, which has a relatively high birth rate or fertility rate, and this is mixed with very high son preference, right. Culturally, countries like India and many countries in Africa too, including Nigeria, son preference. I mean, this is not uniform, but there are parts of Nigeria, there are parts of India where son preference is incredibly high. So not only should India have more people, it should have a lot more women. So this is one of the unintended consequences. I think this as a policy regime, has now been...it’s gone completely out of vogue. It comes up, some politicians will bring it up. In Uttar Pradesh recently, they said, "Oh, we need to limit to two children." Something like that, but this is no longer a major war cry of the socialist era. And I think there has been a lot of learning from China’s forced one child policy and how now it has this aging demographic that can’t quite carry...the next generation can’t quite carry the weight of this skewed demographic that’s going to age. So I think that is a learning globally, that you need to walk away from these very strict population control policies and I think India’s learned something from it. Tamara Winter: I just have two more questions because I know I’ve taken a lot of your time. To what extent does immigration matter for India, whether that’s in-migration or emigration? Shruti Rajagopalan: I think hugely. Indian diaspora does incredibly well abroad, right. And I mean, America’s a great example of this. There’s a fantastic book by Devesh Kapur and Sanjoy Chakravorty, it’s called The Other One Percent, right. And it’s basically talk about how the Indian diaspora in the United States is one of the most high performing groups anywhere, even within the States or anywhere in the world, right. So in terms of outmigration, Indians have done very, very well abroad and they have assimilated very well in a lot of different cultures. I think that really matters, right. That there is a group of people who are entrepreneurial, who are well educated and are syncretic and who can assimilate. In terms of in-migration, India’s neighboring countries, depending on which neighbor, may or may not have porous borders, right. So with Bangladesh, it’s a very porous border. In fact, there are millions of daily wage workers who cross the border, work in India and go back. Now, this is going to be lesser and lesser of a phenomenon, because I believe Bangladesh’s GDP per capita just overtook India’s, right. So as Bangladesh gets richer, we are not going to have an in-migration issue with daily wage labor, it might even be out. It might be Indians crossing the border to go to Bangladesh to look for work. In terms, but a lot of the borders are very, very strict, because it borders with China and there are conflict areas or it borders with Pakistan, which has been a very long running conflict area. So because of that, you don’t have this foot movement across borders, but India for all practical purposes has a pretty open immigration regime. It’s just a question of who would wish to come and work in India and naturally assimilate in that environment. So, it has to be someone who is...it’s very easy for someone who is English speaking, relatively elite, gets very easily plugged into the formal part of the economy. It’s quite easy to move to India and immediately find work and things like that. And India has so many examples of people coming in as BBC reporters and just staying back, right. Because they’ve assimilated almost too well. On the other hand, if you are looking to come from some of the poorer parts of Asia or Africa, it can be difficult to integrate into a country if you don’t know the lingua franca, and India is so specific in terms of its caste and religious and linguistic relationships that it’s not easy for outside groups to just immediately mingle on say, a factory floor or just come and buy agricultural land and become a farmer or something like that. So, the very typical migration that you see from an even poorer country in India to come to India and start picking cotton or something like that, you don’t see much of that happening in India. And as a percentage of population, it’s a blip. India has just got so many people that migration is not the route that changes numbers, meaningfully. Tamara Winter: One, I appreciate so much that you took the time and we’re both optimists, I think, and I wonder, to close this conversation out, what are, to your mind, the most potent reasons for optimism about India’s future? Shruti Rajagopalan: Lots and lots of people, right. And lots and lots of people who are getting better and better and get integrated into the global economy. And this is because of India’s own regime of relatively free speech, democratic systems and access to the internet. So, I should give you this example. Recently, I like collecting a lot of Indian art, especially tribal art. I bought a particular piece of art, it’s made on textile. It’s called Mata ni Pachedi. I can send you the picture and it’s by a wonderful artist called Sanjay Chitara. I hope I’m saying his name right, and he’s from Gujarat and it was...I mean, he’s basically vegetable dye on textile and it was sold on an online auction platform. I bought it sitting in a Washington, DC suburb and the payments were processed by Stripe, right. And so, this kind of integration has now made an artist who works on folk art in India so much richer because we have been able to connect with him and there’s massive gains from trade. Those are the sorts of things that make me incredibly optimistic about India. I think what is preventing India from reaching its full potential is basically, very poor regulation, bad government regulation. Government just needs to get out of the way and let Indians be entrepreneurial. And the second is just very poor health and education systems, which always...I think that really hampers people from reaching their full potential, right. How many wonderful artists and Einsteins and Mozarts and geniuses are hiding in India because they are not plugged into the global network, either because they couldn’t access education or they’re not healthy enough, or they’re not rich enough to afford a phone and an internet connection and so on, right. So I think those are the things, if India can manage to fix, I’m just very, very optimistic about its future, but most importantly, because of its numbers. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. We had additional editing support from Emma Jackson. Original music for the series was composed by Auribus. Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. B-Sides. Tamara Winter: Hello, and welcome to the final episode of season one of Beneath the Surface. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. Over the course of six episodes, we’ve traveled the world from London to Lusaka, from the Salton Sea to Singapore and talked to infrastructure experts and visionaries who are all working to find creative solutions to some of the biggest problems facing their communities and the world. So it’s not surprising that, well, we have a lot more information than can fit into the episodes we made. So today I’m sitting down with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s the series producer for Beneath the Surface. You might remember him from episode two, when we visited his family’s plot of land near California’s Salton Sea. Together, we revisited each episode discussing some of the clips, characters, and stories that got left on the cutting room floor. We also got to talking about some of the big themes and episode ideas that we’ve been sitting on, ones that might make for an interesting season two, possibly a video spinoff? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, I hope you enjoy this look beneath the surface of Beneath the Surface. Everett Katigbak: Well, today we’re back in the studio talking about some of our highlights and lowlights and all the interesting things in between, our experiences in producing Beneath the Surface. Tammy just tracked the final episode, and now we’re just kind of reflecting on some of our learnings from it. Tamara Winter: I also wonder how many times we can say "beneath the surface" in this conversation, take a shot of oat milk every time. Everett Katigbak: So, Tammy, obviously we’ve kind of learned a lot through digging into these various topics, but maybe we can start at the top. The first episode was very kind of close to you, near and dear. And you have a lot of firsthand experience. What has happened in Zambia or what have we kind of just learned in Lusaka and in Nkwashi since we launched that first episode? Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly exciting about that episode, and I think for a lot of this series is that the stuff that we talked about is happening in real time. And that is very much the case with Nkwashi. So actually this week, as we speak and sit here in San Francisco, Mwiya and several other entrepreneurs are hosting the African Union and they are talking about just interesting ideas around trade and development and economic growth. And so I’m sad we couldn’t be there. But Nkwashi itself too, it’s amazing to see people move in. The residents of Nkwashi starting to kind of identify with the city and post about it. I think one of the things that was particularly interesting about that episode is that there’s a growth story within a growth story within a growth story. So we’re talking about a city in Zambia and then beyond that, we’re also talking about what it hopes to enable, which is like a really robust and flourishing technological ecosystem. So since that episode Nkwashi’s grown. There are, it seems like new interesting companies popping up, not just in Zambia, but across the continent, like every five minutes. So I’m optimistic. Everett Katigbak: It was really great kind of going from a place like Zambia and Nkwashi and then kind of bringing that somewhat closer to home. Obviously Salton Sea, was really kind of personal for me, but the most kind of exciting moment that I had there was actually spending time in Slab City and East Jesus and getting to meet a lot of the people that live off the grid there. And actually kind of realizing ultimately infrastructure is about supporting people. It’s the thing that kind of supports a lot of these different communities and lifestyles. Tamara Winter: More broadly, one thing I enjoyed about the Salton Sea episode, I think we could probably do a whole series on places that were, and then are now starting to come back. I mean, I don’t know that Salton Sea was ever on top necessarily, but it’s pretty striking that it went from being sort of the next Palm Springs to like an asthma machine. And so yeah, that could probably be its own series. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, it was interesting when, when we were there, I actually do recall quite a few like luxury cars, like Audis and BMWs driving around and exploring the area. And I can’t tell if they were just kind of extending their Palm Desert vacay or if they were genuinely looking at it from a developer’s perspective, because land can be had for pennies on the dollar there. But maybe there is kind of this thought that lithium is kind of permeating through the community and the people are starting to look at it as more of an investment. So it was really fascinating to see some of that going on. Tamara Winter: Yeah. And it just seemed like the conversation around Salton Sea is very much live. So I’m optimistic. I’m interested to see how GM kind of makes good on its commitment to have all electric vehicles by 2035. I’m interested to see what Tesla does there, what Ford does there. It’s going to be a place to watch, particularly if the Controlled Thermal Resources team can manage to make a breakthrough with the way that lithium is extracted. You’ll hear me say this a lot in this episode, I’m just very optimistic. Supply chains. Everett Katigbak: We talked a lot about, I think supply chains was probably the first episode that we really knew that we wanted to try and tackle this thing, not only because of how it’s been exacerbated by COVID, but also because I think the shipping container as a unit of measurement and as a metaphor and as an example for efficiency, actually gets kind of thrown around quite a bit in the industries and circles that we talk about. But just seeing you and Ryan Petersen interact was really fascinating. And seeing him kind of naturally dig into some of the storylines and the narratives that we talk about things like trade routes, historic trade routes, the Silk Road and how that was not only responsible for trading of goods, but also this kind of cultural transmission and how that shaped a lot of the people. You could almost see it as a cultural gradient throughout broader Asia and the Eastern Europe continent. So, that was really great. Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly interesting about this episode is that Ryan, it’s funny, he’s running one of the biggest companies in the world that’s focused on global trade. Despite the size of the company that Ryan is running, he had such a ground floor view of the acute challenges that the US, and kind of more specifically California, and even more specifically the port of Long Beach were facing. The thought to just like literally go out to the port and talk to some of the union workers and bring tacos. Everett Katigbak: Right. Tamara Winter: And literally just get people talking about what exactly was keeping people’s stuff so backed up was interesting. And it turns out that even though that was such a triumphant moment, when Ryan was able to help the city and really the state get that port up and running, there are still kind of persistent supply chain challenges. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. I remember, I think we had to rewrite some of the intros and some of the narrative bits to hear mainly because it was changing so rapidly. And I think when we first conceived the episode, things weren’t as congested in the ports. And then ultimately by the time we recorded, I remember going out to Malibu and seeing this long stretch of backed up cargo ships. And that was something I’d never seen. I’ve seen it in port towns, like maybe Singapore or Asia, but never on the California coast. So that was kind of mind blowing to actually visualize it. Housing, because a lot of it was Ben Southwood. I actually thought it was great seeing Ben Southwood in his natural element. When we were out there recently, I got to walk around with Ben and he’s just like a natural encyclopedic kind of tour guide, just hearing him point out very obscure, but also fascinating things about, "Look at this building. This brick pattern is because of this. And this is how it affects the building structurally." And going into ancient Rome and Londinium, and this was all within like a three block radius. So I really enjoyed kind of hearing him talk with the Haredi Jews, because they were able to kind of speak the same language, but also from very different perspectives, which was really fascinating. Tamara Winter: We knew we wanted to do something on housing, but the conversation around housing, why we don’t have enough of it, why it’s so expensive for me has gotten just extremely stale. And so it was really nice to see a very interesting community and maybe not necessarily the first one that you would think of being on the front lines of upzoning and really doing something about the astronomical rises in the cost of housing. So I really enjoyed personally, just learning about how Motty and Shmuel and the rest of the community were able to kind of solve their own problem. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, I guess that is one of the kind of things that changed even in the short time, since we launched this episode. I think we’re originally looking at it from a buyer’s perspective, looking at the markets, but then when you start looking abroad and realizing that even things like zoning, these are the things that are really impacting housing costs. And ultimately, what ties to the whole series together, I think it goes back to what a lot of things that Ryan Petersen was talking about, building materials and supply chains are also exacerbating housing inventory and things like that. One thing that I also started to see as a series unfolded was how all of these seemingly disparate topics were kind of connected through supply chain and infrastructure, ultimately. Tamara Winter: One thing I particularly appreciated about that episode was that I think sometimes with infrastructure, it can be such a big topic. It’s something that everybody needs, but it also has a ton of different stakeholders and the costs of infrastructure don’t necessarily always present themselves immediately. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, and it was really great to see. I mean, a topic like housing, there’s so many different vectors that can influence the ways that things like laws and zoning and ultimately building go. And this was a good example of them working with the municipalities local kind of government to retain the kind of historical sense of the area, but also kind of to address their cultural needs. Oh, transit was a great one. It was actually great to see kind of Tammy exploring her new surroundings out in New York City. In the episode she started off being a Dallas born and bred person, but moving to both places like San Francisco and New York that actually heavily rely on public transit. It was also really fascinating again, since we recorded and shipped this episode, there’s actually been some progress with bullet trains out in the Dallas and in the broader Texas area. So I’m wondering how that impacts you and your relationship with your kind of home base. Tamara Winter: Yeah. My sister texted me about that news. She loved the transit episode. So I’m from Dallas. My sister is in school in San Antonio right now. And so she was extremely excited about the bullet train. And I think people in Texas, I mean, that project has just made a ton of sense for a long time. So Texas I’m rooting for you. We started the housing episode talking about the fact that I had lived in San Francisco, DC and New York and kind of my experiences with renting in each of those cities. But the transit one is almost as striking, right? So each of those cities is very walkable, but the experience of taking transit and getting from point A to point B there is just very different. But I knew that I wanted to do an episode kind of as a thank you or a love letter or a like, thanks for welcoming me to New York. So it was really exciting to kind of explore the Upper East Side, to see the actual Second Avenue subway line in action. But it was just incredible listening to people talk about Japan and London and just other cities. I think what’s particularly striking about transit, even though it’s extremely difficult. It’s multifaceted. They’re all different agencies. There are like labor issues. There’s like what the public wants and will allow in their backyards. All of these things end up being impediments to transit. And yet some countries and cities still manage to get it done. Everett Katigbak: You know what, one thing that I observed, even in the kind of very few times that I’ve ridden Japanese trains, it is like quite a user-centric experience. I think it integrates very well into the landscape. It kind of connects this kind of futurist vision that people have of Tokyo and this kind of ancient historic version of Kyoto and the broader area. And it’s not a destructive process. Oftentimes we think of building trains, especially in the United States, it means that we have to tear down or retrofit something that’s historic, and it does change the landscape and make it look and feel different. But in Tokyo, these layers are able to exist in a way that I think is actually, I don’t know, it preserves their cultural history, but it also kind of projects Japan as this very futuristic and forward thinking place. Tamara Winter: Population. I mean, this is the episode that I was most excited about. This is the one I knew I wanted to make no matter if we made any other episode, because I don’t have any special love for buildings and trains and roads. It’s all useful insofar as it serves people. And so I think questions and population are just fascinating. I mean, years ago I got really interested in birthright trends in the first place and what governments were doing about it. And so you could probably sit for hours and just go down a non-stop list of downright comical things that governments are trying to do to address what they perceive to be the sort of big challenges of having an aging population. And so it’s everything from, we talk about Singapore in the episode. What we don’t talk about is like the time that some of their train stations had literal cartoon eggs on the floor, reminding women that they only had like a finite number of eggs, to Italy’s fertility day to the classic Australian campaign, 40 is the new 20, except if you want to have children. And so I was interested in moving beyond the kind of friendly cringe shaming of women and their sort of expanded choices about rearing families and to really kind of observe how people make decisions about fertility. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. It’s really interesting to see how Singapore kind of uses that lever or kind of turns that dial almost the way that we do here in the States with interest rates and things to kind of really stimulate or catalyze the economy because they’re kind of trying to envision 10, 20 years down the road, what the populace is going to do and how they’re going to impact all these things there. But ultimately, it does come down to like people and human capital as the main driver of economy because that’s why we do and make and build the things that we do is ultimately to kind of support and service people and human’s needs Tamara Winter: This episode, I was both very excited about, and that made me kind of uncomfortable because it turns human beings into kind of these fungible widgets that you can just kind of like turn on if you need more and turn off if you need fewer. It’s the one episode again, that I was kind of the most excited about going into it. And it’s also the one that I have the most questions, regrets. I don’t know what you would call that about. There are lots of things within population that are interesting. Decades ago, South Korea had a gender ratio that was like India’s. A lot more men than women due to a lot of like sex selective abortions and kind of social pressures to have more sons. And today their gender ratio is more like Canada’s. How does that happen? That’s a whole story in and of itself. And that right there may be the story of the series. That within every episode there was a thread that we barely got to pull. That could be an entire story in and of itself. It has been such a joy to work on this series, to sit down with climate scientists, population researchers, train nerds, housing analysts, and city builders, and to reflect on how all our lives are shaped by the infrastructure we build. If there were any questions that came up for you while you were listening to the series or just to this episode, let us know. The world of infrastructure is vast. And even though we’ve gone beneath the surface of six facets of it, I feel like in a lot of ways, we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. So get in touch with us. You can send an email to stripepress@stripe.com or you can tweet us at @StripePress or @_TamaraWinter. Well, you’ve heard me say it at the end of every episode, but Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. And since this is the last episode of season one, let me tell you a little bit more about Stripe Press. Our mission is to spread ideas for progress. So we publish books, produce movies, and yes, make podcasts all about people working for progress. One book that we recently released is Pieces of the Action by Vannevar Bush, which was originally published in 1970. For anyone who doesn’t know, he’s the guy who basically founded the National Science Foundation. This book is his account of working as the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II. He was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuse, the mass production of penicillin and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. You can find out more about Stripe Press, the books we publish, the movies we produce, and yes, even the other episodes of this podcast at press.stripe.com. The senior producers for season one up Beneath the Surface are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Original music for Beneath the Surface was composed by Auribus. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface.

Title: Satya Nadella’s biggest AI bubble warning yet is a challenge to the Fortune 500: it’s time to reinvent the knowledge worker
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/is-ai-a-bubble-satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-new-knowledge-worker-davos-fink/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T18:35:08Z
Full Content:
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been leading the charge on artificial intelligence for years, owing to his long alliance with OpenAI’s Sam Altman and the groundbreaking work from his own AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, particularly with the Copilot tool. But Nadella has not spoken often about the fears that rattled Wall Street for much of the back half of 2025: whether AI is a bubble. At the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella sat down for a conversation with the forum’s interim co-chair, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, explaining that if AI growth spawns solely from investment, then that could be a sign of a bubble. “A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” However, Nadella offers a fix to that productivity dilemma, calling on business leaders to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.” This change is not wholly unprecedented, as Nadella pointed out, comparing the current moment to that of the 1980s, when computing revolutionized the workplace and opened up new opportunities for growth and productivity and created a new class of workers. “We invented this entire class of thing called knowledge work, where people started really using computers to amplify what we were trying to achieve using software,” he said. “I think in the context of AI, that same thing is going to happen.” Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “No, no, it’s actually—it flattens the entire information flow. So once you start having that, you have to redesign structurally.” That shift may be harder for some Fortune 500 companies as structural changes could be accompanied by uncomfortable growing pains. Nadella says that leaner companies will be able to more easily adopt AI because their organizational structures are fresher and more malleable. On the other hand, large companies could take time to adopt new workflows. Despite widespread adoption of AI, the 29th edition of PwC’s Global CEO Survey found that only 10% to 12% of companies reported seeing benefits from the technology on the revenue or cost side, while 56% reported getting nothing out of it. It follows up on an even more pessimistic finding about AI returns from August 2025: that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing. PwC global chairman Mohamed Kande spoke to Fortune’s Diane Brady at Davos about the finding that many CEOs are cautious and lack confidence at this stage of the AI adoption cycle. “Somehow AI moves so fast … that people forgot that the adoption of technology, you have to go to the basics,” he explained, with the survey finding that the companies seeing benefits from AI are “putting the foundations in place.” It’s about execution more than it is about technology, he argued, and good management and leadership are really going to matter going forward. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools.” New entrants have the advantage of “starting fresh” and constructing workflows around AI capabilities, while larger firms will have to contend with the flattening effect AI has on entire departments and specializations. To be sure, Nadella says that large organizations have kept an upper hand, especially when it comes to relationships, data, and know-how. However, he maintains that firms must understand how to use those resources to their advantage to change management style, which could otherwise pose a major roadblock. “The bottom line is, if you don’t translate that with a new production function, then you really will be stuck,” he said .

Title: No Company ‘Can Just Coast’ in the A.I. Era, Warns Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

Time Published: 2026-01-20T18:28:11Z

No corporation, big or small, can avoid the challenges of adapting to A.I., according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Larger corporations will be forced to integrate the technology to ward off newcomers, while smaller players must contend with barriers to achieving scale. “It’s going to be a very competitively intense world,” said Nadella during an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today (Jan. 20). “Neither side, whether you’re a new entrant or an incumbent, can just coast.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. In some ways, it may be easier for newer, smaller competitors to accommodate A.I.’s pervasiveness, since they can build their organizations with the technology in mind from the outset. Bigger and more established rivals, meanwhile, will be forced to navigate sweeping organizational change. “Unless your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools,” said Nadella. For now, large companies appear to have the edge. Across corporations with annual revenues exceeding $15 billion, nearly three-quarters of leaders said their organizations are using A.I. on an enterprise-wide basis, compared with just 22 percent of executives at companies with revenues of between $1 billion and $4.9 billion, according to a recent study from Forbes Research. But the disruptive effects of adopting A.I. also grow as companies scale. Most leaders at smaller firms predicted that fewer than 2 percent of roles would be eliminated by the technology over the next few years, compared with 45 percent of executives at larger corporations. It isn’t just companies that A.I. will help equalize, but countries as well. The quality of software developers, startups and large-scale organizations does not vary dramatically from nation to nation, according to Nadella. “It’s fascinating—you can show up in Jakarta, you can show up in Istanbul, you can show up in Mexico City. It’s not that different than showing up even in say Seattle or San Francisco,” Nadella said. The growing accessibility of A.I. has fueled its global spread. Still, Western countries—and in particular the U.S.—retain “more of an energy” when it comes to embracing the technology, said Nadella. As A.I. continues to integrate across societies and economies, the size of a corporation—and the country in which it’s located—will matter less and less. What will matter more, Nadella suggested, is how much control companies maintain over A.I. systems that incorporate their proprietary knowledge. If companies fail to embed that data, they risk “leaking” enterprise value to outside model developers, Nadella noted, describing this as an emerging competitive concern. “The topic that’s least talked about, but I feel will be most talked about in this calendar year, will be the sovereignty of a firm,” said Nadella. “It’s sort of fascinating that nobody’s talking about that.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

January 20, 2026 13:11 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 20, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USANewsGroup.com News Commentary – As we enter 2026, the global uranium sector appears to be hitting a considerable supply wall[1]. With U.S. domestic production languishing at 90% below annual requirements[2], the push for North American fuel independence seems to have shifted from a political goal to a critical market priority. This structural supply-demand mismatch comes at a time when activity in the sector is picking up and positioning several key players as potentially essential infrastructure platforms, including Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), NexGen Energy (NYSE: NXE) (TSX: NXE), Gladiator Metals (TSXV: GLAD) (OTCQB: GDTRF), Premier American Uranium (TSXV: PUR) (OTCQB: PAUIF), and Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE-A: UEC). The primary catalyst is a significant increase in digital power; data center capacity is projected to triple by 2030 as AI workloads redefine the global grid[3]. Consequently, the Western world appears locked in a strategic race to secure domestic critical minerals[4], moving past simple exploration and into the high-stakes build-out of uranium and copper supplies in jurisdictions that prioritize geopolitical security. Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) recently announced a pending merger with uranium miner Eagle Energy Metals, a next-generation nuclear energy company with the largest mineable, measured and indicted U.S. uranium deposit. Following the announcement, Eagle Energy Metals announced that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because following the SPAC merger, the company is heading toward a NASDAQ listing, subject to customary closing conditions, under the ticker symbol NUCL. Notably, the team orchestrating this transaction is the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy Metals holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and seeking to quadruple U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds rights to exclusive Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. NexGen Energy (NYSE: NXE) (TSX: NXE) announced its highest-grade assay results to date at the 100%-owned Patterson Corridor East (PCE) with drill hole RK-25-256 returning 5.5 meters at 21.4% U₃O₈ between 590.0 and 595.5 meter depth, including 2.5 meters at 46.1% U₃O₈ and 0.5 meters at 74.8% U₃O₈. The high-grade uranium intersection is reportedly 119 meters down-dip of drill hole RK-25-232 and an additional 51 meters down-dip of recently reported RK-25-254, with intense high-grade uranium mineralization currently interpreted along a minimum of 215 meters of dip extent. "RK-25-256 high-grade assay results, consisting of ultra-high grade 0.5 m 74.8% U₃O₈ takes PCE into a rare mineralized category on a world scale for uranium deposits," said Leigh Curyer, Founder and CEO of NexGen Energy. "This type of basement-hosted mineralization is synonymous with Arrow, only 3.5 km to the west." NexGen indicated that it is developing a uranium project portfolio focused on multi-generational nuclear fuel supply, with Arrow as the inaugural deposit. The company controls the most prospective portfolio of over 190,000 hectares across 140 kilometers of the southwest Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. Gladiator Metals (TSXV: GLAD) (OTCQB: GDTRF) announced a significant new discovery at its Whitehorse Copper Belt property in Yukon, with maiden drilling at Cub East intersecting 27 meters of 2.56% copper and 1.44 grams per tonne gold within 44.2 meters of 1.69% copper and 0.93 g/t gold. The five-hole program confirmed high-grade copper-gold-magnetite skarn mineralization over 300 meters of strike length, with all holes intersecting significant grades adjacent to the historic Black Cub South pit. "Gladiator's maiden drilling campaign on the newly identified geophysical target at Cub East has delivered exceptional high-grade results and a major new discovery, fully validating the company's innovative exploration strategy," said Jason Bontempo, CEO of Gladiator Metals. "All five drillholes intersected previously unknown zones of high-grade copper-gold-magnetite skarn, confirming robust continuity across more than 350 meters of strike and 300 meters down-dip." The discovery was identified through combined gravity and Induced Polarization surveys beneath shallow cover, with mineralization remaining open in all directions. Gladiator Metals says it is fully funded to execute over 50,000 meters of additional diamond drilling in 2026 targeting high-grade copper skarns throughout the Whitehorse Copper Belt. Premier American Uranium (TSXV: PUR) (OTCQB: PAUIF) announced that it filed a technical report containing its Preliminary Economic Assessment and updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cebolleta Uranium Project in New Mexico, outlining the potential for a low-CAPEX, long-life uranium operation with strong baseline economics. The company indicated that the PEA demonstrates an after-tax net present value of US$83.9 million at an 8% discount rate, with average annual production of approximately 1.4 million pounds U₃O₈ over a 13-year mine life and total production of 18.1 million pounds. According to the company, the project features direct capital expenditures of US$64.2 million and average operating costs of US$41.60 per pound U₃O₈ recovered, with heap leach processing costs of US$16.72 per short ton. The updated Mineral Resource Estimate includes indicated resources of 20.3 million pounds eU₃O₈ grading 0.12%, representing a 9% increase compared to the 2024 technical report, with significant upside potential through improved metallurgical recoveries that could increase the base case after-tax NPV by approximately 90% to US$159 million at 90% recovery assumptions. Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE-A: UEC) reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, achieving a Total Cost per Pound of $34.35 based on production of 68,612 pounds of precipitated uranium and dried and drummed U₃O₈ for the quarter. The company announced that it completed major construction milestones at Burke Hollow setting the stage for initial operations at South Texas's newest in-situ recovery production facility, while advancing six additional header houses at Christensen Ranch in Wyoming's Powder River Basin and completing a full refurbishment of the yellowcake thickener and calciner at the Irigaray Central Processing Plant. "This quarter represented a step change for UEC," said Amir Adnani, President and CEO of Uranium Energy. "With the launch of United States Uranium Refining & Conversion Corp, we added a new business line that positions the Company to become the only U.S. supplier with both uranium and UF₆ production capabilities." Uranium Energy has stated that it maintains a strong balance sheet with $698 million of cash, uranium inventory and equities at market prices with no debt, and holds 1,356,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in inventory. The company's workforce has grown to 84 personnel in Wyoming and 86 in South Texas supporting expanding operations.

European shares were hit by the continuing uncertainty caused by Us president Donald Trump’s tariff threats over his desire to “acquire” Greenland. The tensions have dented sentiment amid a positive start to the year, with investors believing Europe is vulnerable to higher tariffs, but that ⁠defence and infrastructure spending could soften the blow on the markets. The Iseq All-Share index underperformed against regional comparators on Tuesday, falling 0.89 per cent to 12,872.65. Insurance group FBD Holdings Plc topped the index, gaining 2.51 per cent to reach €16.35. That positive movement was not enough to keep the index out of the red, as a series of major components fell. In the news, Ryanair fell 1.18 per cent to €28.49 amid an ongoing saga between chief executive Michael O’Leary and Tesla owner Elon Musk. Mr Musk held a poll on whether he should purchase the company and oust its chief executive. Insulation and building materials specialist Kingspan Group dropped 2.05 per cent to a share price of €69.35. The company was joined in the red by bankers AIB and Bank of Ireland, which each fell 0.69 per cent on the day. The UK’s FTSE 100 logged its steepest one-day fall in close to ‍two weeks on Tuesday amid rising trade uncertainty. The blue-chip index closed down 0.72 per cent. In ⁠London, pharmaceutical stocks fell 1.6 per cent. AstraZeneca fell 2.6 per cent, after the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it would delist its American Depositary Shares and debt securities from Nasdaq. Conversely, precious metals miners rose 1.8 per cent, as gold vaulted past $4,700 an ounce for the first time, while silver hovered near record highs as Trump’s tariff threats sparked a flight to safe-haven assets. Miners have been among the biggest drivers of the FTSE 100’s positive start to 2026, driving it to record highs. European shares touched their lowest in nearly two weeks on Tuesday, as mounting unease over Mr Trump’s tariffs threat ‍over Greenland hurt optimism from earlier in the month. The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 0.7 per cent lower, marking its biggest two-day drop in two months. While some remain sceptical about the extent to which Mr Trump will follow through on his threats, investors ‌are ​on ‍edge as the US president has shown little sign of softening his rhetoric. In company news, French automaker Renault Group’s shares rose 2.2 per cent after it said sales volumes had risen 3.2 per cent in 2025. Oil major TotalEnergies was up 1.4 per cent, as the company said it expects lower oil and liquefied natural gas sales in the fourth quarter of 2025, but stronger margins on refining fuels. Britain’s Wise jumped 16 per cent on robust third-quarter results, while Qiagen gained 12.4 per cent after a report said it is considering strategic options ‌amid fresh interest. Luxury group LVMH shares fell 2.2 per cent. Mr Trump threatened to slap a 200 per cent ‌tariff on French wines and champagne to push French president Emmanuel Macron to join his Board of Peace initiative. Wall Street’s main indexes started the holiday-truncated week on ‍a dour note as investors were spooked by the Greenland-related tariff threats from Mr Trump against Europe. The Nasdaq broke below its 50-day moving average – an important technical threshold – while the S&P 500 hovered at the edge. Critical Metals, which has a ⁠strategic presence in Greenland, slipped 2.7 per cent. Earnings season is also kicking into a higher gear, with several industry bellwethers set to report their quarterly earnings this week. Netflix gained 0.6 per cent after switching to an all-cash offer for Warner Bros Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, without increasing the $82.7 billion bid. The streaming giant, due to report its quarterly ‌earnings after the bell, was the only ‌stock in the mega-cap FAANG group of tech stocks – Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google – to trade in the green. Industrial bellwether 3M tumbled 8.5 per cent after forecasting annual adjusted profit a touch below Wall Street expectations, while Fastenal fell 3.8 per cent after missing fourth-quarter revenue estimates. – Additional reporting Reuters From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s billionaire CEO warns AI could be capitalism’s next big failure after 30 years of unsustainable inequality after the Cold War
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/blackrock-billionaire-ceo-larry-fink-capitalism-critique-ai-world-economic-forum-davos/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T17:51:56Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink opened the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with a stark message to the global elite: AI’s unfettered growth risks pummelling the world’s working and professional classes. Beyond that, he warned that it could be capitalism’s next big failure after a 30-year reign after the Cold War that has failed to deliver for the average human being in society. In his opening remarks on Tuesday at the gathering of thousands of executives and global leaders, the billionaire boss of the world’s largest asset manager—often called one of Wall Street’s “Masters of the Universe”—said that as those in power discuss the future of AI, they risk leaving behind the vast majority of the world, just as they have for much of the last generation. “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more wealth has been created than in any time prior in human history, but in advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,” Fink said. Fink, who has used his annual BlackRock letters and annual appearances at Davos to set the agenda for a more progressive kind of capitalism, even one that is arguably “woke,” making him at times the face of ESG and of stakeholder capitalism, warned that the gains of the tremendous wealth creation since the 1990s have not been equitably shared. And the capitalist ideology driving AI development and implementation forward could come at the expense of the wage-earning majority, he added. “Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data and owners of infrastructure,” Fink said. “The open question: What happens to everyone else if AI does to white-collar workers what globalization did to blue-collar workers? We need to confront that today directly. It is not about the future. The future is now.” Fink, who was appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab, has long espoused the reshaping of capitalism, seeing it as a responsibility of large asset managers like himself. Fink was formerly vociferous about the importance of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, and has argued that climate change is reshaping finance, creating an imperative for executives to reallocate their capital to address the crisis accordingly. In a 2022 letter to investors, published the day before the Davos summit, Fink emphasized a model of “stakeholder capitalism” of a business’s mandate to serve not just shareholders, but employees, consumers, and the public. Fink’s new primacy in Davos is the first without Schwab, following allegations that he had expensed more than $1 million, billed to the World Economic Forum, on questionable travel spending, as well as claims of workplace misconduct and research report manipulation. The BlackRock chief emphasized the need for the gathering to demonstrate its legitimacy in part by showing that it’s concerned with more than just swelling growth of companies and countries, but also the economic welfare of its employees and citizens. “Many of the people most affected by what we talk about here will never come to this conference,” Fink said. “That’s a central tension of this forum. Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone.” Though BlackRock announced in early 2025 it would roll back many of the diversity, equity, and inclusion goals it created a few years before, Fink has once again used his spotlight to call on leaders to transform their capitalist sensibilities, this time in how they imagine the AI future. Last year capped an explosion of growth in the AI sector, with Morningstar analysts finding a group of 34 AI stocks, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, shot up 50.8% in 2025. AI firms and investors have seen their wealth skyrocket in the past year, with Per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the median increase in net worth last year was nearly $10 billion among the 50 wealthiest Americans. Google co-founder Larry Page and Sergey Brin, for example, got $101 billion and $92 billion richer, respectively, in 2025. The BlackRock CEO noted these gains, however, have been reserved for the richest few, alluding to a K-shaped economy of the rich getting richer, while the poor continue to struggle: The bottom half of Americans, in short, are not cashing in on the AI race. Although Fink didn’t get into the politics of utilities setting electricity prices, it seems the poor are actually paying higher bills to support the data centers powering the AI boom. According to Federal Reserve data, the poorer demographic owns about 1% of stock market wealth, translating to about 165 million people owning $628 billion in stock. Conversely, the top 1% of wealthiest households own nearly 50% of corporate equity. Fink’s framing of the post-Cold War era as one of exploding inequality represents a mainstreaming of a once niche view that has become increasingly mainstream in the 21st century. While the triumph of the west over communism was seen as the ultimate victory for capitalism, as epitomized by Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man, history has in fact continued. The unprecedented rise of China as an economic superpower, through its fusion of socialism and capitalism “with Chinese characteristics,” has complicated the narrative, as has the inequality alluded to by Fink. An internal critic of the post-Cold War world order is Andrew Bacevich, a military veteran and historian who likened the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 as “akin to removing the speed limiter from an internal combustion engine.” Bacevich’s 2020 book The Age of Illusions: How America Squandered Its Cold War Victory, was an early articulation of the once niche viewpoint that Fink lent support to on Tuesday. Similarly, the risks of the AI boom on workers extends beyond who has a stake in the technology industry’s growth. Nobel laureate and “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton has previously warned this explosion of wealth for the few will come at the expense of white-collar workers, who will be displaced by the technology. “What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.” Some companies have already leaned into culling headcount to grow profits, including enterprise-software firm IgniteTech. CEO Eric Vaughan laid off nearly 80% of his staff in early 2023, according to figures reviewed by Fortune. Vaughan said the reductions happened during an inflection point in the tech industry, where failure to efficiently adopt AI could be fatal for a company. He’s since rehired for all of those roles, and he would make the same choice again today, he told Fortune. According to Fink, sustaining a white-collar workforce will depend on the world’s most powerful people creating an actionable plan that will defy the critiques of capitalism that has, so far, stood to predominantly benefit them. “Now with abstractions about the jobs of tomorrow, but with a credible plan for broad participation in these gains, this is going to be the test,” Fink said. “Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen.”

Title: Trump may name Jerome Powell’s replacement at Davos: Meet the top 4 candidates for Fed Chair
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/trump-naming-fed-chair-pick-davos-world-economic-forum-jerome-powell-kevin-warsh/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T17:45:00Z
Full Content:
Between the usual panels and buzzier geopolitical debates grabbing headlines, the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is playing host to a high-stakes drama: Who will emerge as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and on what terms? President Donald Trump is nearing an announcement on who should lead the Federal Reserve once Jerome Powell’s term ends in May, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and speculation is growing that Trump could do so during his Davos address on Wednesday. Although Trump has claimed for weeks that he already knows his pick, he has appeared to relish turning what is typically a staid confirmation process into a political spectacle—what some analysts have likened to a Celebrity Apprentice–style reveal. What began as showmanship has now evolved into a full-blown institutional standoff among the Justice Department, members of the Senate, and jittery financial markets parsing every hint about whether the next Fed chair will lean dovish or hawkish. The search process has been upended by a Department of Justice investigation into Chair Powell, centered on renovations at the Federal Reserve’s headquarters. Powell has publicly decried the investigation as a “pretext” for political intimidation, a sentiment echoed by a bipartisan coalition of former Fed chairs and sitting GOP senators. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has already signaled a potential blockade, vowing to oppose any nominee until the DOJ investigation is fully resolved. This move could prevent Trump’s pick from even reaching a floor vote, at least in the foreseeable future. For much of the past year, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett appeared to be the natural heir apparent. A veteran of Republican economic policymaking and a key architect of the 2017 tax overhaul, Hassett enjoys credibility with GOP lawmakers and Fed officials alike. Yet his prominence inside the Trump administration has become a liability. Hassett has emerged as one of the White House’s most visible economic messengers, frequently defending administration policy on television. He’s good at that unsavory job, Trump said on Friday, and the president is afraid of “losing him” in that position. “I’m saying, ‘Wait a minute, if I move him, these Fed guys—certainly the one we have now—they don’t talk much,’” Trump said to reporters at a White House event, then addressed Hassett, who was listening in the audience. “I would lose you. It’s a serious concern to me.” Analysts suggest the move reflects a pragmatic calculation by the administration; given the toxic environment surrounding the Powell investigation, Hassett’s close political ties to the president might have made him an impossible sell for a Senate Banking Committee determined to reassert the Fed’s institutional independence. Markets were unhappy about the potential loss of a clear Fed dove, however, and the 10-year Treasury closed on a four-month high Friday. As Hassett’s path narrows, attention has increasingly shifted back to Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who led the forced takeovers and bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis before publicly breaking with Chair Ben Bernanke over quantitative easing, in which the Fed creates money to buy bonds to push down interest rates. Warsh is widely viewed by markets as the “independence candidate,” hawkish on inflation, skeptical of political pressure, and institutionally orthodox. The more toxic the Powell investigation becomes, the stronger Warsh’s appeal grows among senators eager to reassert the Fed’s credibility. He was in the final running for Fed chair against Powell in 2017, and while he was praised (many times) by Trump for his good looks, he was ultimately passed up because of his relative youth.In the second Trump term, Warsh is not only 55, but has seen his main dogmas grow more in vogue. His famous slogan, “Inflation is a choice,” refers to his belief that the Fed raises interest rates when the economy “grows too much” and workers “get paid too much,” rather than owing to real inflation. He has warned for years that the government’s $38 trillion debt is influencing the Fed’s decision-making, incentivizing it to keep interest rates artificially low to reduce the cost of servicing the debt. Now that many economists and politicians have begun warning of “fiscal dominance,” Warsh’s views might be palatable to the markets and his potential fellow Fed governors. But if Warsh is also considered too political, Trump may turn to a quieter option, Christopher Waller. A sitting Fed governor with a reputation for accurate forecasting, Waller is seen by many as the technocratic fallback: less politically exposed, less polarizing, and potentially easier to confirm. When a group of CEOs at a recent Yale event responded to a live poll about who they wanted for Fed chair, 81% chose Waller. That’s likely because Waller has consistently argued for more rate cuts, with little evidence he is politically captured. That ability to thread the needle is more important now than ever. Markets might rejoice if Trump announces BlackRock executive Rick Rieder as the dark-horse pick. The only person on the short list with no Fed experience—something considered a positive in the administration—Rieder oversees $2.4 trillion in bonds as BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income. He has also vocally called for a lower neutral interest rate, noting that AI gains will be disinflationary and that the Fed’s challenge now is to avoid “labor potholes.” As the Davos summit begins, the focus remains on the “two Kevins” and the looming decision that will define the American economy for the latter end of the Trump era. If Trump does use his Davos address to name Jerome Powell’s successor, the pick would still need to get past the Senate Banking Committee to make it to the floor for a vote. If the DOJ investigation doesn’t get resolved, Trump might not be able to get anyone through the GOP coalition on the banking committee that is standing by Powell. But investors are betting that Powell will not be indicted, and Justice Department official Jeanine Pirro, who apparently spearheaded the investigation, has softened her posture slightly, writing on X that the matter is just a question of Powell responding to Justice Department “outreach.”

January 20, 2026 12:38 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 20, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global single-use bioprocessing market reached a valuation of USD 30.12 billion in 2025 and is forecasted to expand to USD 122.92 billion by 2035, achieving a robust CAGR of 15.1% from 2026 to 2035. Today, the Single-Use Bioprocessing (SUB) market has definitively transcended clinical boundaries to become the operational backbone of commercial biomanufacturing. Fueled by an urgent industry mandate for flexible capacity, the sector is witnessing a technological breakthrough, exemplified by Thermo Fisher’s 5,000 L DynaDrive and ABEC’s 6,000 L systems, which now rival stainless-steel throughput. This structural shift is validated by massive capital projects, including Samsung Biologics’ 180,000 L capacity expansion, confirming SUB’s viability for high-volume production. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/single-use-bioprocessing-market Financially, the value proposition is compelling. As per Astute Analytica’s finding, Stakeholders leveraging single-use platforms realize a 40% to 50% reduction in CAPEX and accelerate facility commissioning by nearly 18 months. Operational efficiency is equally transformative in the single-use bioprocessing market, with CDMOs like WuXi Biologics utilizing agile, disposable workflows to manage a USD 20.1 billion backlog while cutting water and energy consumption by 46%. As sustainability becomes a regulatory priority and downstream innovations achieve 17x higher yields, SUB is no longer an alternative but the competitive standard. With the FDA approving 16 single-use-manufactured biologics in 2024 alone, the market is poised for sustained, high-velocity growth, fundamentally redefining the cost structure of global drug delivery. Key Findings in Single-Use Bioprocessing Market By Workflow, Upstream Bioprocessing Dominates By Enabling High Density Perfusion Architectures Upstream bioprocessing commands the lion's share of revenue in single-use bioprocessing market propelled by its pivotal role in enabling high-density perfusion architectures that redefine productivity benchmarks. Traditional fed-batch processes cap cell densities at 20-30 million cells/mL, but perfusion modes—powered by single-use ATF filtration integrated into bioreactor bags—sustain 100+ million cells/mL over 30-60 day campaigns. This eliminates stainless steel's sterilization nightmares: complex piping loops prone to biofilm buildup and validation delays. Disposable assemblies turn the bioreactor into a plug-and-play engine, slashing changeover times from weeks to hours and boosting titers 5-10x. The value proposition skyrockets "value per batch." Reinforced films withstand shear forces and extended runs, justifying premiums of 20-30% over basic bags. With downstream lagging in continuous purification—still bottlenecked by Protein A costs at $14,000/L—upstream captures 55% market share. Investments flood in: Cytiva's XDR platforms and ABEC's ATB™ exemplify scalability to 6,000L, fueling perfusion for bispecifics and cell therapies. North American retrofits amplify this, with Amgen-like hybrids yielding 40% OPEX cuts. Asia Pacific's scale-out farms parallelize perfusion lines, hitting commercial volumes in 12 months. Upstream isn't just dominant; it's the intensification vanguard, locking revenue as biopharma chases yield revolutions amid biosimilar wars. By Product, Simple and Peripheral Elements Capture Value Through The Integration of Sensor Intelligence Dismissed as commoditized, simple and peripheral elements—tubing, connectors, filters—seize 40% revenue of the single-use bioprocessing market via smart integration of PAT sensors, morphing passive plastics into data powerhouses. Pre-welded pH, DO, and biomass probes enable real-time CPP monitoring, sidestepping reusable sensor risks in sterile bags. A basic manifold jumps from $500 to $5,000 with embedded intelligence, compliant with FDA's stringent PAT mandates. Automation surges demand: single-use pinch valves and flow sensors sync with DCS in "ballroom" facilities, digitizing fluid paths for Industry 4.0 precision. This razor-blade evolution absorbs fixed instrumentation budgets, with high-margin kits bundling RFID-tracked assemblies. Failure rates—1-5% from pinholes—drop 60% via overwraps and laser welds, per USP <665>. Sartorius and Millipore lead, offering 20% discounts on sensorized manifolds for ADCs and vectors. Post-pandemic normalization cuts lead times to 8 weeks, but 12.8% CAGR persists, driven by closed GMP imperatives. Vulnerabilities linger—resin shortages inflate filter costs 15%—yet volume reigns: a 2,000L run devours 500+ units. Peripherals transcend simplicity; they're the neural network of bioprocessing, embedding compliance and analytics into disposables for agile, high-velocity operations. By End Use, Biopharmaceutical Manufacturers Lead By Optimizing Asset Utilization Ratios Biopharmaceutical manufacturers dominate the single-use bioprocessing market with 60% share, weaponizing single-use to skyrocket asset utilization from 60% to 95%+. Steel-era downtime—30-40% on CIP/SIP—vanishes as suites become generic shells, with assemblies handling Week 1 vaccines and Week 2 mAbs. This consumes vast consumables: monthly blockbuster sites outpace yearly pilots, fueling baseload demand amid 14% underlying growth post-stockpile burn-off. "Clinical-to-commercial" standardization seals the deal—uniform films/connectors across scales nix tech transfer headaches, locking multi-year contracts. Pfizer and GSK exemplify evolutive facilities: 2-4 day modality switches versus steel's weeks, yielding 30% OPEX savings. CDMOs nibble niches but lack volume heft. Inventory recalibration stabilizes leads at 6 months, unleashing capacity for 300+ mAb pipelines. Risks like $500M writedowns fade as AI optimizes assemblies. Biopharma's scale—24/7 campaigns—ensures leadership, blending flexibility with reliability to command the market's economic core in a multipolar biologics arena. Accelerating Innovation in the Single-Use Bioprocessing Market Through Advanced Reactor Technologies The single-use bioprocessing market is witnessing a technological surge defined by unprecedented bioreactor scales and efficiency. Thermo Fisher Scientific recently launched the 5,000 L HyPerforma DynaDrive, the largest commercial system of its class, offering a robust 20:1 turndown ratio. Such innovations drive demand as they deliver a 190% increase in oxygen mass transfer compared to legacy designs. Competitors match these strides, with ABEC achieving blend times of under 60 seconds in their Custom Single Run systems, which now reach maximum working volumes of 6,000 L. These advancements allow manufacturers to achieve a 41% lower cost per gram using high-volume DynaDrive systems. Furthermore, the sector sees expanded capabilities in mixing and automation. Cytiva introduced the Xcellerex magnetic mixer in 2,000 L and 3,000 L capacities to solve large-scale buffer preparation challenges. Sartorius also strengthened the single-use bioprocessing market by releasing the Biostat STR Generation 3, which supports scalable volumes from 50 L to 2,000 L with native DeltaV automation. High-volume efficiency is crucial, as Thermo Fisher’s 5,000 L workflow demonstrates a 27% reduction in product and packaging waste versus 2,000 L legacy systems. These engineering breakthroughs confirm that single-use technologies can now rival stainless steel in performance. Massive Facility Expansions Highlight the Demand for Single-Use Bioprocessing Capacity Global leaders are aggressively expanding manufacturing footprints to accommodate soaring demand in the single-use bioprocessing market. Samsung Biologics will operationalize Plant 5 by April 2025, adding 180,000 L of capacity to its network. Upon the completion of Bio Campus II, the company’s total capacity will reach a staggering 784,000 L, covering an area of 96,000 m2. Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies is similarly investing USD 1.2 billion in its Holly Springs expansion. The site will house 8 new large-scale bioreactors, each boasting a capacity of 20,000 L, solidifying the shift toward flexible manufacturing. Smaller players and diverse regions are also contributing to this capacity boom. Syngene International operationalized its Unit 3 facility in late 2024, bringing 20 KL of total capacity online through 10 distinct single-use bioreactors. In Europe, CPi Biotech invested USD 11 million (EUR 10 million) to establish a new facility spanning 36,000 sq ft. Such investments underscore the industry's reliance on the single-use bioprocessing market to scale operations rapidly. Operational readiness is faster, with single-use technology capable of reducing facility construction timelines by 18 months compared to traditional builds. CDMOs Drive Market Growth Managing Hundreds of Complex Biological Projects Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations are the primary engines propelling the single-use bioprocessing market. WuXi Biologics reported managing a massive portfolio of 742 integrated projects as of mid-2024. The firm added 61 new projects in just the first half of the year, highlighting the sector's velocity. Their pipeline is diverse, containing 123 bispecific antibody projects and 167 Antibody-Drug Conjugate programs. Additionally, 23 vaccine projects are currently under development. To support this volume, WuXi employs 4,200 scientists dedicated to these complex modalities. Commercial readiness within the CDMO sector is equally impressive. WuXi Biologics completed 16 Process Performance Qualifications in 2024 and has scheduled another 24 for 2025. The company currently holds a service backlog valued at USD 20.1 billion, reflecting sustained long-term demand. Lonza is also expanding its capabilities by adding 2 new bioconjugation suites to its Ibex Dedicate facility. These figures illustrate how CDMOs rely on the flexibility of the single-use bioprocessing market to manage high-mix portfolios. WuXi supports these efforts with a workforce of 12,435 staff globally and maintains a high talent retention rate of 94%. Operational Economics and Efficiency Gains Are Reshaping Manufacturing Cost Structures Financial incentives are accelerating the adoption of the single-use bioprocessing market. Capital expenditure for single-use facilities is typically reduced by 40% to 50% compared to traditional stainless-steel plants. Operational speed is another benefit, as Thermo Fisher’s 5L DynaDrive system increases productivity by 27% compared to glass reactors. Researchers can run 141 experiments annually with these systems versus only 111 with glass, effectively reducing the workflow cycle time to 31 days from 39 days. These efficiency gains translate directly to the bottom line. Technical performance metrics further justify the investment. ABEC’s large-scale bioreactors now support oxygen transfer rates exceeding 45 1/hr, ensuring high cell density growth. Thermo Fisher’s 3,000 L systems offer 12:1 turndown ratios, enhancing economic flexibility for varied batch sizes. Risk mitigation is also monetizable; Cytiva estimates that a single minor leak in a large mixer can cost a manufacturer USD 60,000 to USD 100,000 in lost material. Avoiding such losses through reliable single-use technologies is a key economic proposition for stakeholders in the single-use bioprocessing market. Downstream Market Evolution and Increasing Commercial Scale Adoption Rates The downstream segment of the single-use bioprocessing market is expanding rapidly to match upstream productivity. This sub-sector was valued at USD 1.57 billion in 2024 and is projected to rise to USD 1.79 billion in 2025. Single-use chromatography systems commanded a 35.6% market share in 2024, driven by innovations like Sartorius’s "Sartobind Rapid A Lab." These membrane units offer 17 times higher antibody yields than resin columns and are rated for 100 purification cycles. Repligen further supports this growth by offering lead times of just 8 weeks for its large-scale OPUS pre-packed columns. Broader adoption statistics reveal the dominance of disposable systems. Single-use bioreactor systems held an 81.19% market share within the reactor segment in 2024. Commercial-scale systems ranging from 500 L to 2,000 L accounted for 52.44% of revenue, while the pilot-scale segment is growing at a CAGR of 17.11%. Mammalian cell culture applications dominate with 62.34% of the share, and monoclonal antibody production accounts for 45.21% of usage. Bags and connectors see usage rates exceeding 85% across facilities, confirming the ubiquity of the single-use bioprocessing market. Regulatory Approvals and Commercial Successes Validate Disposable Manufacturing Platforms Regulatory bodies are increasingly endorsing products manufactured via the single-use bioprocessing market. The FDA approved 50 new drugs in 2024, 16 of which were biologics that heavily rely on single-use components. Among these, 13 monoclonal antibodies were approved, serving as a key driver for disposable reactor demand. WuXi Biologics supported 16 commercial manufacturing projects in the first half of 2024 alone. The firm also has 56 late-phase projects preparing for commercialization, indicating a robust pipeline of future approvals. Commercial validation is evident in the operational success of these platforms. WuXi’s ability to manage dozens of late-stage projects proves that single-use technologies meet stringent GMP requirements. The seamless transition from clinical to commercial scale is a hallmark of the modern single-use bioprocessing market. Regulatory agencies now view these flexible facilities as standard, facilitating faster approvals for complex biologics. As more products reach the market, the reliance on disposable flow paths continues to solidify as the industry standard. Supply Chain Localization and Strong Financials Signal Long Term Market Stability Localization strategies are enhancing the resilience of the single-use bioprocessing market. Sartorius India delivered 50 pallet tanks for single-use mixing in 2024 and has committed to an investment plan running through 2027. The Indian arm currently employs 670 people to support local supply needs, reducing lead times for regional manufacturers. Such moves mitigate global supply chain risks. Financially, Sartorius generated sales revenue of EUR 3.4 billion in 2024, maintaining a healthy underlying EBITDA margin of 28.0%. These financial metrics indicate sustained corporate health and the capacity for continued R&D investment. Strong margins allow companies to innovate further, ensuring the single-use bioprocessing market remains dynamic.

Alex Karp, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of the AI defense technology company Palantir, had a top humanities-based education. Karp graduated from Haverford College, an elite liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, with a degree in philosophy. He then attended Stanford Law School and later earned a Ph.D. in neoclassical social theory at a top German university. "A very, very strong education," Karp said during a panel at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. In the age of AI, that kind of academic trajectory will doom you, Karp told Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, who was leading the discussion. AI "will destroy humanities jobs," Karp said.

"You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill," Karp said, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market. The Palantir CEO said it would probably be possible for those with humanities backgrounds to keep a job once they secure it, but he said technicians and those with other vocational skill sets are going to be in the highest demand. He gave the example of people building batteries for a battery company, saying that "they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly." "There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training," Karp told Fink. But not all at Davos agree with the tech leader's assessment of the future of jobs. Finance executives attending the global forum have been telling Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco that liberal arts degrees might be the new hot commodity. As AI takes on more of the hard financial analysis, it is transforming the skill set executives prioritize in young recruits. Critical creative thinkers are back in the spotlight. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also weighed in on jobs during a joint panel on Tuesday, saying that entry-level hiring at their companies was already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down in both the junior and mid-levels of his company. Jump to

Investing Nvidia (NVDA) trades at less than 25 times forward earnings with 62% expected EPS growth next year. Broadcom (AVGO) carries $65B in debt and trades at 34 times forward earnings with slower growth. Nvidia has traded flat around $180 since August while underlying earnings continue climbing. Sending You to Google News in 3 © HelloRF Zcool / Shutterstock.com There has been a loss of momentum for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in recent months, which has been the case for many other stocks leading the AI rally. Investors are using that as an excuse to move into other names in the stock market, but is that really a smart idea today? NVDA stock trades at $180 as of this writing. Shares have been lingering in the $180 range since August. One would expect a lot more action from the supposedly best AI bet. The anemic price action can mostly be traced back to the anxiety investors have about the “AI bubble” potentially bursting this year. Nvidia is an easy target for the bears after all. However, bulls expect the price action to speed up in the coming months through next year. Financials are still healthy, and Wall Street can’t keep underpaying if earnings keep climbing. Could this take NVDA stock above $300 this year, or should you buy Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) instead? AVGO stock has been hotter than Nvidia due to its smaller size and competitiveness in the AI scene. Let’s find out if it can keep that up this year or if you’re better off sticking to NVDA stock. The stock may be trading sideways, but it is actually getting cheaper… fast! The company’s underlying earnings have been climbing quarter after quarter, meaning a flat share price has turned Nvidia into one of the cheapest AI chip stocks you can buy today if you go by the forward price-to-earnings ratio. NVDA stock trades at less than 25 times earnings, despite analysts expecting 62% EPS growth for the next fiscal year. Revenue growth is also expected to be 50.6%. Growth hasn’t fallen off as quickly as the bears would have expected, and AI demand has remained strong with no sign of a slowdown. Management has kept its beat-and-raise cadence. As a result, nothing yet points to any weakness that can drag the stock down substantially from here. Instead, I expect the growth to continue and accelerate in the coming months. NVDA stock should ideally trade at around 35 to 40 times forward earnings. Even that might be too cheap, considering stocks like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) go for 35 times forward earnings with half the sales growth. The biggest predictor of NVDA’s price is its earnings. If we look at EPS, FY 2026 (ending January 2026) is expected to end with Nvidia having $4.7 in EPS. Guidance suggests revenue of around $213.3 billion. 2027 EPS is expected at $7.6, with revenue of $321.2 billion. If NVDA stock trades at 35 times earnings for FY 2027, the stock price can hit $266. I expect it to go even higher if management keeps beating estimates and raises its guidance. The highest EPS estimate puts $9.7 as a possibility for FY 2027, meaning NVDA stock could trade over $300 at just 31 times earnings. It is likely that the premium paid would be even higher if it managed to outperform consensus by such a wide margin. Anyhow, $300 is clearly in the books for Nvidia this year. The stock needs to climb 60% from here to be at $300, which should happen as long as the share price follows EPS growth. I would go further and put $266 as the floor price for 2026. The PE ratio is unlikely to drop below 35 times earnings. I’d argue that AVGO stock gives you a worse deal compared to Nvidia. You’re paying more per dollar of the company’s earnings, even though it has worse growth metrics and a worse long-term outlook. The company does come with an “underdog” story due to custom AI chips plausibly stealing customers from Nvidia, but it’s not going to make a dent in its market share. You’re paying 34 times forward earnings and 17 times forward sales for the stock. Growth is expected to be over 50% for both sales and EPS, but fall to 38% in FY 2027. Keep in mind that the total debt load is over $65 billion, so the enterprise value is also slightly worse. With that in mind, I’d stick to NVDA stock. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Explaining the Japanese bond-market rebellion that has the whole world on edge

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment. Japanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall. What's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament. The news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation. As of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland. "These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse," David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. "Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe." Rising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks. With yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the "carry trade." Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields. Yields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets. How things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday. "On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields," Boivin and his team wrote. There are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too. For one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook. Jump to

Title: Justice Thomas, Joined by Justice Gorsuch, Argue for Broader Scope of Constitutional Ban on Ex Post Facto Laws

Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent Criminal Justice Eugene Volokh | 1.20.2026 11:36 AM Brief excerpts from today's concurrence in Ellingburg v. U.S., though the whole opinion is worth a read: I join the Court's opinion in full because it correctly applies our precedent. I write separately to clarify the foundation of that precedent. This Court's 1798 decision in Calder v. Bull established that the Ex Post Facto Clauses forbid only those retroactive laws that impose "punishment" for a "crime." Over the 228 years since Calder, the Court has struggled to articulate what it means for a law to impose punishment for a crime, and thus to be subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses. The Court's more recent precedents have implemented Calder through two multifactor tests that turn largely on whether the legislature labels the law as criminal or civil. But in 1798, "punishment" for a "crime" would have been understood to refer to any coercive penalty for a public wrong. Many laws that are nominally civil today would therefore have been subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses under Calder. I would restore Calder's approach to the Ex Post Facto Clauses…. Calder's understanding secures Ex Post Facto Clause protection in a wide range of contexts involving nominally civil laws. Those contexts include civil proceedings seeking fines for public offenses. See, e.g., Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co. (2016) (describing "civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each day [the challenger] violated the Act"). They include enforcement proceedings brought by administrative agencies. See Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U. S. 175, 196 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring) (describing the 20th-century rise of such proceedings). And they include municipal sanctions like speeding tickets. "If one were to commit a minor traffic offense at a time the offense was to be punished by a $25 fine, and the government were to then amend the statute and impose a fine of $1,000,000 dollars, it would be nonsensical to treat that fine as non-punitive simply because the offense was processed civilly." Brief for Professor Beth Colgan as Amicus Curiae. Because all of these offenses impose punishments for public wrongs, Calder would treat them all as subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses.

Title: Disney Reverses Exclusion of Shareholder Proposal to Review Controversial Disability Access Pass Changes
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-reverses-exclusion-of-shareholder-proposal-to-review-controversial-disability-access-pass-changes/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T16:23:02Z
Full Content:
Last month, we reported on a new proposal made on behalf of DAS Defenders calling on the Walt Disney Company to conduct an independent and public review of its controversial Disability Access Service policy changes. This resolution was originally excluded from shareholder consideration, but now Disney is reversing course and including it in its proxy materials for a vote. Here’s the latest on that, what it means and doesn’t, and why this is happening. As quick background, Disney overhauled DAS at Walt Disney World and Disneyland back in May 2024. According to the company, the changes were due in large part to abuse, misuse, and proliferation of the program’s use–with issuances of DAS tripling from 2019 to last year. For more about the specifics of the overhauled DAS, see Disability Access Service (DAS) Changes at Walt Disney World FAQ. The new system has now been in place for well over a year, and there have been direct impacts for disabled guests as well as indirect ones for all guests. To the latter point, we’ve written a lot about the impact of the DAS changes on wait times at Walt Disney World. Most recently, in Is Lightning Lane Multi Pass Still “Worth It” at Disney World? Suffice to say, standby lines are shorter and faster moving, with wait times being lower year-over-year as a result of the DAS crackdown. Even over 18 months later, the DAS overhaul remains controversial. It’s also a sensitive subject that is personal since it’s make or break for some guests trying to experience Walt Disney World and Disneyland. There have been reports of guests who previously had DAS being denied and advised to use alternative accommodations instead. here have also been a number of small tweaks to DAS over the last year, some of which could be attributed to a pending class action lawsuit. With that background out of the way, let’s turn to the shareholder proposal. Our previous coverage of this confused some readers, and the latest wrinkle is only going to compound that confusion (just look at that headline–quite the mouthful). Accordingly, we’re going to try to simplify and condense this to the greatest extent possible. Here goes nothing… Disney’s brand and financial stability are under strain from underperforming films, rising park costs, consumer boycotts, and waning trust. According to the resolution, a significant contributor to this strain is the company’s recent overhaul of disability accommodations at its parks due to negative media coverage, social media, guests canceling trips and Annual Passes, as well as legal exposure to a class action lawsuit. As a result of the controversial DAS changes, Disney exposed itself to legal claims, regulatory scrutiny, and brand damage. Other companies have faced multimillion-dollar settlements under accessibility-related actions. Future liabilities could include costly settlements, operational disruption, and weakened market positioning. Accordingly, shareholder resolution requests that Disney commission an independent review of DAS, conducted by a qualified third party. This review should assess legal, financial, and reputational risks; evaluate Disney’s policies against competitors; and identify opportunities for improvement. The resolution further requests a public summary on the findings for accountability and transparency. In its original response letter from late last year, the Walt Disney Company wrote that it intended to exclude the aforementioned shareholder proposal from the proxy materials for its 2026 annual meeting of shareholders. This meant that shareholders would not vote on whether to approve the resolution for the independent review. Disney also sought assurance of no enforcement action from the SEC following the exclusion. Disney’s argument for exclusion was that any attendance decrease in the last fiscal year was attributable to hurricanes. Moreover, park operations are ordinary business and not subject to shareholder micromanagement; that they’ve already done their due diligence on the DAS changes, and there’s no duty to disclose any nonpublic information. You can read Disney’s full argument here. Fast forward to January 2026, and Disney has sent a new letter to the SEC withdrawing its no-action request, meaning that they no longer are seeking any assurances from the SEC. The reason they’re doing this is simple: because they’ve reversed course and decided to include the aforementioned shareholder proposal in their proxy materials for the 2026 annual meeting. If you’re confused, you’re probably not alone. Here’s what this does and doesn’t mean, along with some quick commentary… For starters, this does NOT mean that the Walt Disney Company has suddenly had a change of heart and is agreeing with the shareholder proposal in any way, shape, or form. It does not mean they have agreed to the independent audit being sought. If that were the case, this would be a different letter entirely; probably a joint statement from Disney and the shareholder (or the advocacy group behind him) indicating that the parties are moving forward with collaborative and constructive efforts on reviewing the DAS changes and current policies. That sort of thing. Instead, what Disney is saying is that they’re going to let shareholders vote on whether to conduct such a review. This shareholder proposal will almost certainly be voted down. One of the reader misconceptions in response to our previous coverage was that this proposal was being driven by investors concerned about the impact of the DAS changes on the company’s financials. It’s probably better viewed as a subset of shareholders framing an issue that’s personally important to them in such a way to make it appropriate for proxy vote; a different angle for contesting the DAS changes, aside from litigation. Anyone who has listened to the annual meetings knows that there are a lot of politically-charged and niche causes presented. All of them are summarily shot down without much in the way of further discussion. As a Disney shareholder, I could write a proposal about how the company’s refusal to reimagine Journey into Imagination has resulted in financial strain, underperformance, unrealized earnings, social media backlash, and brand damage. I could cite things like popcorn bucket, merchandise sales, and DTB blog posts in support of my position. It would be a more ‘legitimate’ way of raising the issue (as opposed to during the Q&A), but it would be an equally futile effort. There’s no reason to believe the fate of this DAS proposal will be any different. While we strongly believe Disney should do a better job at finding a middle ground and have a more delicate touch in handling DAS, it’s hard to see this as something with which shareholders will concern themselves. One important thing to keep in mind here is that it’s not the individual shareholders who are outcome-determine on things like this. It won’t be plugged-in fans who are sympathetic to the plight of disabled guests casting the deciding votes. It’s the large institutional ones who are make or break. And although Disney’s stock has underperformed for the last several years, that’s definitely not attributable to the theme parks. If anything, the parks are what is carrying the company and preventing that share price from dipping well below $100. As we’ve covered in earnings call reports and crowds coverage, attendance was down year-over-year (by about 1%), but that was largely attributable to hurricanes ($120 million disclosed losses). Meanwhile, the parks continue to set revenue records and hotel occupancy continues to rise. Right or wrong, that’s what matters to shareholders. Simply put, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are not going to concern themselves with this. It will be deemed too trivial, and they will accept Disney’s arguments that were laid out above. The shareholder proposal will fail, and it won’t even be a close vote. Given that, the more curious question from my perspective is why Disney even bothered to exclude the shareholder proposal in the first place? One particularly astute commenter, Jack, offered this explanation in response on the previous post: First, they’ll have to draft a response in their proxy statement as to why shareholders should vote no on the campaign. This opens up its own can of worms – if they make a material misstatement, they could be liable for false/misleading proxy materials. The legal due diligence to prevent such an error probably isn’t cheap either. Second, letting the proposal come to vote is far more “public” than asking the SEC to issue a no-action letter. Most Disney tourists and media outlets aren’t going to search through EDGAR to see Disney’s request for non-enforcement from the SEC on this proposal (you are the exception that proves the rule, of course). But I could certainly see far more media attention on this issue if it came up during the annual shareholder meeting. Moreover, they’d be “on the record” as well. Disney can’t just point to Wall Street and say that businessmen voted against the proposal: Disney is the one *telling Wall Street* to vote against it! Finally, allowing the proposal to move forward would draw more attention to the DAS Defenders and activists proposals in general. As it stands, Disney is taking the position that this proposal isn’t even worth voting on – it’s shareholder micromanagement, substantially overlapping with current plans to review DAS access, etc. If Disney actually responded to the proposal in the proxy statement, it almost legitimizes the opposition. Disney, with its history of hostile activist campaigns since the ’80s and especially recently with Trian, likely doesn’t want to give even one inch here lest other shareholder activists get any ideas about taking a mile. I found this explanation to be persuasive at the time (and largely still do). Although the no-action request drew some media attention (including from the mainstream), more eyeballs will certainly be on the annual shareholder meeting. At the same time, there are always a lot of shareholder proposals that are quickly shot down and I seldom (if ever?) see coverage of those. It’s easy to zone out during that section of the call, as anyone who has ever listened can likely tell you. The signal to noise ratio is not so hot during that portion of the meeting. Regardless, it’s odd for Disney to reverse course at this point. Attention has now been drawn to an (likely doomed) shareholder proposal twice, and theoretically will again once the annual meeting rolls around. It makes me wonder what change happened in the background over the course of the last month. UPDATE: As KenMH pointed out in the comments to this post, the SEC issued a Statement Regarding the Division of Corporation Finance’s Role in the Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 Process for the Current Proxy Season on November 17, 2025. With this, the SEC has determined to not respond to no-action requests for, and express no views on, companies’ intended reliance on any basis for exclusion of shareholder proposals. That statement was made 10 days after Disney submitted its no-action letter, so Disney wouldn’t have known of that position when making the request. Basically, this means that the Walt Disney Company is not going to get a response from the SEC with regard to its no-action letter. On this same basis, many other companies have withdrawn their no-action requests, presumably due to the legal uncertainty of them (just look at all of the “withdrawn” parentheticals here). That’s the simplest and most straightforward for this reversal; that Disney is taking the certainty of the proposal being shot down by shareholders over the risk of an enforcement action resulting from excluding it without the backing of the SEC. My guess is that Disney’s proxy response will say as little as possible (for the reasons Jack laid out), likely just reiterating the ground covered in their original letter to the SEC. That’s probably all the convincing it’ll take for BlackRock, Vanguard, etc. Ultimately, we do not anticipate any major changes to DAS at Walt Disney World or Disneyland. Nor do we view there being any likelihood of success with the shareholder proposal. There is not going to be another overhaul to Disability Access Service, absent the aforementioned class action lawsuit or other litigation prevailing. That happening is also doubtful. Disney has been sued over every single iteration of its disability accommodations, and I’ve yet to find any record of them losing on any count. I can’t see anything different about this lawsuit; if anything, Disney might be able to better argue that lines and crowds are inherent to the theme park experience. The company has already endured a lengthy PR hit over these changes, there’s no chance they’ll voluntarily endure that again with another overhaul. What, if anything, does happen will be a slow trickle of rule relaxations. But with no major changes in the last several months, even that is now looking increasingly unlikely. We’ll conclude by once again reiterating our position that Disney should work towards improving DAS. Just because we believe this shareholder proposal is almost certain to fail doesn’t mean we don’t think Disney should take a second-look at its DAS policies. They should. The company has an exemplary reputation for guest service. The need for DAS reform was absolutely understandable, as there was rampant abuse exacerbated by social media, entitlement, and Disney creating an incentive for DAS scammers by monetizing line-skipping via Lightning Lanes. There have been heartbreaking stories of DAS denials, and these have made clear that a more flexible and humane approach offering greater discretion to Cast Members is optimal. It seems that Disney went too far with the DAS overhaul; the pendulum swung from one extreme to another. There has been a lot of collateral damage among disabled guests who needed DAS and have been denied under the overly-stringent system. The DAS changes haven’t just eradicated the scammers, they have hurt guests who are actually disabled. It’s time to recalibrate from the extremes to the center. The most obvious change we’d like to see is a “humanizing” of the interview, not just expanded rules and policies for the mechanics of that process. We’ve heard from many readers who have been denied, and there’s a word that has been used repeatedly to describe the process: interrogation. While we can appreciate how stressful this process is for Cast Members and the verbal abuse they take for disgruntled guests, there’s a better way of handling the process that feels less adversarial. Even if the letter of the DAS policies isn’t going to change, the company still should live up to its reputation by finding a gentler way to handle the process. Planning a Walt Disney World trip?

Thoughts on the shareholder proposal for an independent review of DAS changes at Walt Disney World and Disneyland? Hopeful that further changes will be made that result in increased approvals for those who truly need DAS while keeping abuse low? Agree or disagree with our assessment of the changes or policy as a whole? Please try to stay on topic–we’ve noticed some of these DAS comments sections get heated and personal. Discuss the policy itself, not others’ use (or lack thereof) of it. This one will take a lot of “thinking out of the box” ideas. In my work place, whenever a particularly sticky problem comes up, the boss assembles a team of folks impacted by the problem and everyone is encouraged to throw out ideas including any that seem DOA. In these brainstorming sessions all ideas are treated equally, recorded and no one is allowed to make fun of any ideas put forth regardless of what you may personally think of them. But frequently, one of those DOA ideas puts a “spark of imagination” into the situation and helps lead to the best answer. So, with that in mind, I’ll start with this one: How about designated day(s) on certain weeks or months that ONLY those that qualify for DAS and their families can attend X park? I certainly could plan my trip around those if known well in advance. And those that qualify for DAS are still welcomed into the other parks on that day but not afforded most of these accommodations? What else can you come up with. Let’s give the Disney folks something to mull over. Honestly in my opinion I feel Disney went overboard with the DAS changes. My philosophy has always been you don’t make radical changes in a policy because people are following it . You should be figuring out who exactly is t following the rules. There are significant changes that affect the actual disabled person negatively . The cap being only four people can be on the DAS ticket is silly . There are plenty of families where mom and dad bring the kids and there are more than two. That’s just wrong. Also there’s no setting up rides in advance anymore you have to be in the park to make inly one choice of a ride. Then waiting ten minutes after you swipe in for your ride to get another one. Generally you are in line or on the ride and it’s impossible to get on your phone and try to prepare your next ride. Most of this doesn’t affect us as our daughter is an adult and we only bring her. However, it does make it difficult to enjoy any more than two to three rides. She cannot tolerate being in the park long so it’s very difficult . The changes made to DAS were supposed to identify abusers but it also is penalizing disabled people . I have to agree with the comment that many accommodations were thought up in a different time- when you didn’t see half the attendees at the park qualifying with a disability and bringing their entire family in tow. Even if we ignore that gen z 53% stat – you can just add up general population percentages for some major diagnoses (autism, ADHD, anaphylaxis allergies, IBD, etc) and without much trouble you’re right up in the 30-40% range before looking at things like PTSD and anxiety. I would love the idea of a sensory waiting area – but that gets back to a combination of things people don’t want to say and things that they are already complaining about- the drama at the moment with the current situation is that people are saying it’s only autism that qualifies, so if you made the accommodation something that only addressed the needs of a specific stereotype of autism, we haven’t made progress. People want the freedom to do whatever with that wait time. (need and want, but it’s VERY individual) Penning them into a dark quiet room with half the park with the same pass is no better than leaving them in line. It begs the question of what about those of us who NEED that time for the bathroom? NEED to eat on a schedule, NEED to be away from the smells, the foods, etc. The people who see it as fair use and a need to go nap and return for their ride? It would be a massive endeavor significantly altering the business model (the amount of space would be mindboggling) and still nobody would be happy with it. You would now have a dark, sensory room crammed to the gills with screaming children waiting with their sibling who create the exact environment people in the room were escaping in the first place. There obviously isn’t an easy answer, but the reality that there IS significant data that giving a “do whatever with your time without waiting in the physical line” pass to everyone with a disability is an unreasonable tax on park operations and is unsustainable for not only everyone without the pass, but also for those who had the strongest need for it. It must be acknowledged that can be both unfair that people who are uncomfortable with a line are stuck in a line, and also unfair that the alternative asks others to wait in a line that takes 4x as long so that others don’t have to wait in the line. It might become more equitable if they could work out a system that considered usage – because when someone with a DAS can ride multiple times what a non-DAS user can in the same time, that is not equal. Then you get into it not being fair to limit the disabled group when others aren’t “limited” but the reality is the non-DAS group is in every practical way limited BY those using the DAS due to their lowered capability to accomplish the same tasks. We need DAS to return. The return time is important but especially with DAS Pass. The best part of DAS is that I receive a return time but I do not have to return at that particular time. I can come back anytime up until park closes. Yes, I can not get another pass until this one is used but it allows me to go on mine train when I feel I can without any issues. (Epileptic) I continue to go to WDW several times a year for the love of Walt Disney himself. My last trip a week ago was not able to get on anything. I have another trip planed in March at the BC and I know I will not get on anything again. Yes, I still have the shows. It is my hope that the powers to be will come up with something even if it is one ride per day. George MC My autistic son just got denied to get the DAS since the third party Health representative at the guest services decided that she can not give it to him unless he goes into the que inside Disneyland and if he gets a panic attack then she might consider. We have all the reports of his neurological assessment and a proof that he has autism, epilepsy, and severe anxiety, in addition to social disorder, still, she said that she can Not see his medical record and Does not want to read them.:” he doesn’t qualify for DAS. “He gets panic attacks around people especially in crowds and ques, yet he loves Disneyland. We always had the privilege to get him a DAS at Disney where he gets the best time of his life. After spending 3-7 pm ( 4 hrs) today asking for different managers, at the guest services, they all said that she is the one who decides on whether he qualifies or not. I am really heart-broken, we have booked the annual non-refundable magic passes, only to go back home with a mental and emotional breakdown. Thank you truly for writing that article, it is meant to be for me today. Disneyland is Not the Happiest Place On Earth Anymore. It is discriminatory, where families of special needs kids feel left out and never ever would make the same mistake of purchasing tickets again. Some thoughts: 1. KenMH is on the money, definitely missed that as well in the first news cycle. I think that there are some plausible explanations for the delay between asking for SEC staff comment on excluding the proposal and then the about-face here. There are the holidays, filing requirements for 10-Qs/10-Ks, and weighing the uncertain litigation risk from DAS Defenders if they were to exclude the proposal without SEC approval. The last factor is likely the most important. My guess is that after the SEC’s updated guidance, Disney Legal took their time mulling over the costs and decided that letting it come to a vote was worth it for a few reasons. First, shareholder litigation takes place in a specialized court in Delaware. Whereas in-house counsel probably deals with hundreds of tort cases in FL courts every year for slip-and-falls and the like, they’d have to hire (expensive!) outside counsel to deal with a shareholder suit. After a cost-benefit analysis of potential litigation vs. drafting a proxy statement, the latter was presumably cheaper. Second, Disney would be facing sophisticated counsel. Disney has dealt with shareholder litigation that is well-financed by outside parties as recently as 2023. See Simeone v. The Walt Disney Company (Del. Ch. June 27, 2023) (finding that a shareholder’s books-and-records request was pretextual, as they had been solicited to make the request by the Thomas More Society, a “public interest law firm championing Life, Family, and Freedom.”). While Disney Legal isn’t afraid of some heads-up baseball, so to speak, the off-chance that a shareholder suit is successful could have significant implications for how domestic park operations are managed. Why take the risk? Finally, Disney has already faced enough bad PR in recent times with regard to public litigation. The 2024 public’s reaction to Disney’s attempt to use mandatory arbitration under a Disney+ T&C clause was less than favorable. I don’t think they’re eager to take a stand in a court of law that would put then put them back in the court of public opinion for supposedly discriminating against disabled folks. 2. The next question is what will actually be in the proxy statement and if it even matters. Like you’ve pointed out, the institutional giants are probably going to vote No against the proposal no matter what. Thus, Disney is incentivized to minimize their exposure to bad PR by drafting a concise proxy statement with something along the lines of “We have been working in park operations and line management for 50+ years, world-class industry experts, carefully tuned the DAS system to appropriately deter cheaters and maximize accessibility, etc.” If the media even picks it up (as you’ve pointed out, most just tune out during this portion of the earnings call…), it’ll be one bad news cycle. Then Disney won’t have to deal with a similar proposal for 3-4 years due to exclusion rules related to unsuccessful shareholder proposals. 3. Finally, there’s the question of where we go from here. I think that DAS Defenders rightly points out that the park experience is declining in quality due to, in part, monstrous wait times. This is essentially a supply-and-demand problem. There is not enough ride supply to meet current guest demand. There are only so many rides at each park. Moreover, given the price of entry, people want to experience everything! So much so that they’re willing to pay an additional premium (Lightning Lane) to raise their chances of doing so. Thus, Disney faces conflicting incentives to solving the wait time problem by either shifting ride demand to other forms of entertainment (shows, street performers, dining options, etc.) or by increasing the supply of rides. They want to improve the guest experience and encourage repeat visits, but boy…that Lightning Lane money sure does juice up quarterly earnings – especially around the holidays! Not to mention, having guests wait in line is free. Street performers and new rides cost money. I’m not sure that we’re at a breaking point since ticket prices go up every year and the parks, aside from the pandemic years, have only increased their attendance figures. But I do think that the company recognizes that they are rapidly drawing from a water table of goodwill that may not last for much longer absent any major changes: hence, the massive influx of investment into Villains Land, Monsters Inc., Tropical Americas. The only issue is that these additions have to meaningfully offset the additional demand that they induce. If these additions are like adding an additional lane of traffic to the Texas interstate (“Just one more lane will solve traffic, trust me bro.”), then the problem will only get worse. But if the company follows a dense, singles-and-doubles approach to supply of entertainment where cheaper rides have high capacity, the park experience will meaningfully improve. It’s difficult but doable for the company and guests to have the best of both worlds – higher attendance figures and shorter wait-times. I think this is going to be an uncomfortable, controversial topic for a long time to come. A Deloitte survey found that 53% of Gen Z identify as neurodivergent. Even if there’s some substantial sampling error there, and even if some of that neurodiversity involves things like dyslexia only (which doesn’t typically involve things like sensory issues, unless there’s a co-occurring condition) – that’s still a substantial portion of Gen Z. Even if not every person who identifies as ADHD or autistic feels they need accommodations, presumably a significant number do, as sensory issues, anxiety, and difficulty with self regulation are fairly core for a lot of people. Honestly I’m not sure what to make of those numbers. I know rates of autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities have been rising exponentially, but are we really at 53% for young people? I don’t know. That doesn’t even get into other conditions, such as physical disabilities, PTSD, seizures, etc. I think the idea of disability accommodations as we know them were created in a different era, and we’ll see a lot of changes over the next few decades. I wouldn’t rule out a situation where theme parks simply have to create an alternative to lines in general (not in the next few years, of course, but in 30 some years I could see it.) “I know rates of autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities have been rising exponentially, but are we really at 53% for young people?” I wonder how much of this is rates of those disabilities increasing, versus diagnoses increasing. I’m not saying it’s solely an either/or proposition, but it also wouldn’t surprise me if we’re getting better at identifying those conditions–or testing has become more sensitive to catch borderline cases. Either way, your point stands–just another layer to the discussion that will assuredly play out in the years to come, and not just with Disney. I think the reason it’s so polarising is because it is an unusual combination of both necessary and unfair. It’s necessary because nobody would argue that people with disabilities should be prevented from experiencing attractions. But if someone with DAS uses it to ride Guardians 5 times in a day, is that fair? If they would have spent 5×90 mins queueing for the ride had they been able to, then absolutely yes it is fair. But statistically, not many people would do that. What I would say (and I don’t think this is controversial) is that hardening the eligibility is the wrong approach. That is a recipe for heartbroken guests. Better to err on the side of inclusivity, as implied in this article – and if this volume causes operational issues (or – more cynically – revenue loss from LL), the corrective should come from moderating the extent of the accommodation. For example (just one idea), use metrics on how much time guests are prepared to queue (on average) per day, and DAS uses come out of that quota. Completely agree! Although with DAS, you still have to wait in a queue – it’s just virtual. So if the line is 90 minutes, you would still need to wait that amount of time which prevents people to ride things immediately or over and over. If you have das, you can only use it once for each attraction. The only way you could ride 5 times is once with das and 4 times waiting in the standard cue. That’s how it always worked for my son Jaynee there is not a usage cap on DAS. You can do the same ride over and over. The paid service limits to one use per ride, but there has long been an argument that a non-disabled person could ride again, so the disabled must be able to as well. It’s interesting you mentioned above that Disney already offers a line skipping product. Why isn’t that an alternative to DAS for most? The accommodation could be that a person who needs DAS can buy it even when sold out. And for attractions where a LL is not offered, then use a return time. ADA is supposed to make things accessible to all equitably, DAS is not necessarily that. With DAS, the person is given a return time for the attraction, granted it is the same amount of time as the wait time, however, they can go and do other things such a shop or eat lunch or even experience another attraction, while someone without DAS has to stand and wait in line. That’s really not equitable. I’m not really sure what the solution is, I will vote for no review. There is an obvious solution to the “doing two things” problem you describe, namely a sensory waiting area. Eligible guests and their party could check in to the waiting area (designed as a comfortable inclusive space with seats, soft drinks etc), and time spent inside the waiting area counts toward DAS queue time that they can use for a future ride. This would cost Disney more as they would have to staff it (and lose some F&B sales), but firstly facilities like this would be good PR in the first place, and secondly it would arguably be more profitable in the long run. Full disclosure, I have a decent number of Disney shares (not even a rounding error to the DIS market cap, I assure you LOL) and when the proxy arrives I will vote no. Not because I know much about the DAS changes – I count myself fortunate in that regard – but because putting park operations changes (or even studies of them) “up to a vote” strikes me as a terrible precedent. I do hope, per Tom’s comments, that a satisfactory middle ground can be found! Appreciate this perspective, and agree with it. Unfortunately, the DAS discourse has become so polarized that I fear this type of nuance is being lost. It’s okay to acknowledge that a proposal like this is destined to fail (because it is), or shouldn’t even be up for vote in the first place (because of the precedent it sets) and also think that DAS has been mishandled and needs further fine-tuning. I wonder if it’s worth considering the strategy of the other side. In respect of which, I am wondering if those challenging the current policy actually quietly accept it and do not envision a reversal, and rather their true motivation is to prevent further limitations. In this regard, Disney will be forced to make statements as to why the current system is balanced, proportionate and sustainable. Once those statements are on record, those statements can be used to directly argue against further erosion. I’d be very surprised if it’s about the long game. I’d also be surprised if Disney has anything now that functions as precedent preventing future changes. Keep in mind that there’s already past litigation that went through a lot of discovery, and that didn’t stop Disney from making subsequent changes. Pretty easy to argue that circumstances have changed if further changes are deemed necessary down the road. I worry that people need to stop pushing or Disney will get rid of DAS entirely. The ADA requires things like ramps, bathrooms, parking spaces for Disabled, and communication (phone calls that help the deaf, etc…). Line skipping isn’t an ADA thing. When I was young, the DAS pass didn’t even exist. DAS seems to have become a headache, and they don’t legally need to provide it. There’s a bit more nuance to it than that, but you’re on the right track. Businesses must make “reasonable modifications” in their policies, practices, and procedures to accommodate a person with a disability. However, they do not need to modify a policy if it would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the business’s goods or services. There’s a lot more to it than that, but that’s the nutshell version. The question thus becomes whether the requested accommodations pass a reasonableness test, and also whether waiting in lines is fundamental to the theme park experience. Disney does offer a paid line-skipping product, so the answer to the second question might be no. But maybe not–it’s something that could end up eventually playing out in court. Interested to see what Jack says, but the SEC limited their no-action relief in November, right? So Disney either has to supplement to get a formal response or just exclude the proposal without SEC opinion. Maybe just letting the proposal take the L in ordinary course is SOP now if you can’t get the no-action from the SEC? Great call–that’s gotta be it. Totally missed that in the aftermath of the government shutdown. And the timing of Disney’s original letter would’ve been before the SEC made the announcement of that limitation. Assuming this is the explanation (and I can’t think of anything else even remotely plausible), it really just comes down to Disney not being able to take the uncertainty. Outcome will still be the same, of course, but wow, what a long road to get there. I’ll go back and update the commentary in a bit in light of this…have to move on to F&F coaster for now.

Title: Trump’s Fed chair decision could come next week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says

Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday lodged a pointed attack against Fed Chair Jerome Powell – accusing him of putting “his thumb on the scale” if he attends upcoming Supreme Court arguments over President Trump’s attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell, who is named as a defendant in Cook’s case seeking to block Trump from ousting her over mortgage fraud allegations, is reportedly planning to attend Supreme Court arguments on Wednesday. “I actually think that’s a mistake,” Bessent told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Tuesday during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “If you’re trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale, that’s a mistake.” Bessent himself sat in the front row of the gallery during Supreme Court arguments in November about Trump’s authority to impose sweeping tariffs, alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer. In a different line of attack on Tuesday, the treasury chief took aim at Powell for not meeting with federal prosecutors last month before they issued subpoenas related to the criminal probe of the Fed’s headquarters project. Bessent also blasted Powell for asset purchases made around the pandemic that resulted in huge losses and for the resignation of “four to six” senior Fed officials related to compliance issues. “If that happened at a Wall Street firm, the CEO would be out,” Bessent said. Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, bashing the chairman for not lowering interest rates fast enough – but Bessent has previously appeared to take a more neutral stance on Powell. During a November speech at a US-Saudi investment forum, Trump even insinuated that Bessent had talked him out of firing Powell and let him serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May. Trump’s decision on his choice for the next Federal Reserve chairman could come as soon as next week, Bessent said Tuesday. The president has narrowed the race down to four potential candidates, including Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock exec Rick Rieder. “We’ve had substantial conversations about this. We’ve run a process that started in September – 11 very strong candidates. We’re now down to four candidates. The president has personally met with all of them, and it’s going to be his decision,” Bessent said. Powell could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. Last week, Powell revealed that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer over the Fed’s $2.5 billion headquarters renovation in DC. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” Powell said in a stunning video statement. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.” Trump first nominated Powell to lead the Fed at the start of his first presidential term. Last week, Warsh surged ahead of Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chairman after Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current role as an economic adviser. Trump also ruled out Bessent for the role “because he wants to stay where he is.” Markets had placed better odds on Hassett for weeks. While Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current job, it’s not impossible for him to win the nomination. After Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned last summer, Trump tapped Stephen Miran, then a top White House economic adviser, to fill the role. Miran refused to fully resign from his White House job, instead taking an unpaid leave of absence. Advertisement

Title: Six things to know about Germany's job market in 2026

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Headlines about job cuts, the struggling economy and layoffs sparked by AI are common at the moment. But how is the German job market faring and what can we expect in 2026? Whether you are looking for a job, want to change industries or have your eye on Germany as a place to find new career opportunities, we've rounded up some trends affecting the job market this year. Workers want job security It's fair to say that Germany's labour market hasn't exactly been thriving of late – and unfortunately, this is expected to continue. The number of job vacancies has almost halved since its peak in 2022, and is even lower than pre-Covid times. "What is particularly dramatic is that fewer new jobs are being advertised than ever before," Enzo Weber from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), told German business newspaper Handelsblatt in a report earlier in January. This makes it a difficult market and means that many people are prioritising stable positions rather than giving up a job they don't like to or going freelance. "Employees are looking for reliable conditions," said labour market expert Julius Probst from recruitment portal Stepstone. Jobs that offer security are therefore likely to remain highly competitive in 2026, especially if they come with a decent salary and the opportunity to work flexibly. READ ALSO: Five hard truths foreign jobseekers need to know Remote/flexible working is not as easy When it comes to flexible working, employees may have to take a step back in 2026. The range of remote work options is declining slightly, studies by the job portal Indeed suggest, with employers having the upper hand. According to the latest data, flexible arrangements are only offered in around 14.1 percent of all job advertisements at the moment, with flexible working hours only offered in 19 percent. At the beginning of 2025, the proportion of jobs offering 'home office' options was 14.7 percent, while 20.2 percent of ads mentioned flexible working hours. It may be because more roles where in-person attendance is required are being advertised. These include sectors like construction, health, care and defence, where remote work and flexibility are difficult to implement. The takeaway is: it's not impossible but remote working isn't as accessible. "Working from home is changing from the norm to a negotiable benefit," said Virginia Sondergeld, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. This is a tend seen across the world as many managers have implemented mandatory office attendance following relaxed rules during the pandemic era. READ ALSO: Where most jobs are expected to be cut in 2026 AI is important – but it's not wiping out all jobs in Germany Unless you've been living under a rock, you'll be aware that everyone is talking about generative AI, known as KI (Künstliche Intelligenz) in German. So how is AI affecting the labour market in Germany? Several companies, such as Microsoft and Amazon, which employ people in Germany, have cited AI as the main reason for recent redundancies. But it's not all bad news. "While the number of job ads is declining overall in areas such as marketing, HR and project management, the demand for AI skills in these very professions is exploding," said Sondergeld. Importantly, we're not seeing mass layoffs across the board. A recent study by the IAB found that AI could see 800,000 jobs lost by 2040, but the same study said AI will create around 800,000 new jobs during the same period. The IAB study authors said the technology could even help increase Germany's GDP by 0.8 percentage points annually. Enzo Weber described AI as "the technology of our time that can be used across all areas". He added: "It will take on more and more tasks, but there will be a transformation in the job market, not a collapse.” Meanwhile, economist Julius Probst said jobs that require empathy and interpersonal skills will not be affected. It essentially means an understanding of AI will be important in 2026, but it's not needed everywhere. Career changers are in demand as worker shortage grows If you've been looking to take on new skills or move to a different sector altogether, now is the time. As The Local has reported, Quereinsteiger (career-changers) are in demand. These people enter a new profession without the traditional qualifications and experience from that field. READ ALSO: Why demand for 'career changers' is rising sharply in Germany But that's exactly why they are sought after. HR managers like that they bring their experience and perspectives from other industries. With Germany facing an ever-growing shortage of skilled workers, there are plenty of opportunities out there for those willing to be flexible. Many companies are moving toward skills-based hiring: hiring practices that value practical skills over formal qualifications. "In 2026, for the first time, fewer people will be entering the labour market in Germany than leaving it," said economist Probst. "This is another reason why skills are becoming more important than formal qualifications." International workers are needed Speaking of the labour shortage, 2026 will also see red tape eased in a bid to attract foreigners with in-demand skills to Germany. The new Work and Stay Agency, due to launch this year and be implemented over the coming years, is expected to offer faster procedures, clearer guidance and a single point of contact for people looking to live and work in the country. Billed as a “one-stop government”, it will link visa offices, the Federal Employment Agency and local immigration authorities. The coalition government initiative is a response to Germany’s shifting demographics, as a wave of retirements shrinks the workforce and deepens pressure on the economy and social security system. READ ALSO: The planned changes to immigration and citizenship in Germany in 2026 Wages are rising and becoming more transparent In January, Germany's minimum wage rose by 8.4 percent. "This is having a particular impact in low-wage sectors such as catering and agriculture," said Weber. And even employees who earn more can expect an increase, albeit a small one. "Wages have recently risen by almost five percent. However, the increase will be smaller because the economic situation is difficult and the days of high inflation compensation are over," added Weber. Wage transparency will also be an important issue in 2026. EU member states must implement the EU Pay Transparency Directive into national law by June 7th, 2026. German companies need to catch up. Employers will soon have to tell applicants the starting salary or salary range either in the job ad or before the first interview. Employees can also request information about their individual pay and the average pay for comparable jobs (broken down by gender).

This includes launching of a Sector Rotation Fund, setting up its entity at Gift City, rollout of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and gearing up for a comprehensive ETF build-out. “Having crossed 10 lakh customers since our launch last year, we are looking to expand our suite of offerings with a key focus on diversification. We intend to offer differentiated exposures to our investors via SIFs, ETFs and Gift City,” Sid Swaminathan, MD and CEO, JioBlackRock AMC, said. Additionally, the AMC intends to launch a series of funds across debt, equity and hybrid. “We continue on our path of giving our investors a choice of products with focus on cost efficiency, accessibility and long-term value creation,” he said. He also added that out of 10 lakh investors, nearly 18 per cent are first-time mutual fund investors. The joint venture between Jio Financial Services and BlackRock has also seen strong participation from investors beyond major metros, with 40 per cent of its retail investors coming from B-30 cities, significantly higher than the industry average of 28 per cent. B-30 cities in India refer to cities beyond the top 30. Giving details of the new offerings, a statement by the AMC said active funds will be based on BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) platform – the same platform that powers its maiden Active Equity offering – the JioBlackRock Flexicap Fund. The first of these is the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund, the NFO of which will open on January 27 and continue till February 9. “With equity markets tending to move in cycles, which impact each sector in different ways, the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund is built to adapt to these shifts by dynamically rotating across sectors based on macro and market indicators, while also managing risk in response to evolving market dynamics and emerging opportunities,” the company said. Further, the AMC plans rolling out SIFs aimed at meeting sophisticated investment requirements, deepening engagement with investors through differentiated products and risk-managed outcomes. As part of its broader product expansion, it is also gearing up for a comprehensive ETF build-out, with a focus on evaluating building blocks that can enable deeper retail penetration, institutional participation while creating scalable and cost-effective solutions, the statement added. The AMC is also in the process of setting up its entity in Gift City and securing the required regulatory permissions that will allow the development of cross-border fund structures and a retail presence. This will enable Indian investors to responsibly access global allocation opportunities and international investors to obtain access to differentiated investment opportunities in India, the statement said.

KeyCorp NYSE: KEY executives highlighted improved profitability, strengthening credit trends, and an accelerated capital return plan during the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call on Jan. 20, 2026. Management also outlined 2026 financial guidance and discussed continued investments in hiring, technology, and artificial intelligence, alongside several board changes announced the same morning. Get KeyCorp alerts:Sign UpFourth-quarter results: revenue growth outpaced expenses Chairman and CEO Chris Gorman said fourth-quarter and full-year results reflected progress on KeyCorp’s “organic path to achieving consistently higher returns on capital.” The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.43 per share, while CFO Clark Khayat noted earnings were $0.41 per share on an adjusted basis. Revenue exceeded $2 billion, growing 12% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, while expenses grew 2%. Keysight Technologies' Surge: The Market Wakes Up to This AI PlayKhayat said tax-equivalent net interest income rose 15% year-over-year and net interest margin (NIM) ended the quarter at 2.82%, up 7 basis points sequentially and above the company’s previously indicated target range of 2.75% to 2.8%. He attributed sequential NII growth to commercial client deposit growth and balance sheet optimization, including running off lower-yielding consumer loans and allowing higher-cost brokered CDs and borrowings to roll off. Non-interest income increased 8% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, which management described as broad-based across priority fee businesses. Fourth-quarter investment banking and debt placement fees were $243 million, up 10% year-over-year, driven by debt capital markets and commercial mortgage debt placement. Trust and investment services income rose 10%, supported by record positive net flows and higher market values, while assets under management reached a record $70 billion. Big Buybacks: 3 Large Caps Exceed 5% Repurchase PowerKhayat said fourth-quarter non-interest expense totaled $1.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year, but included roughly $30 million of “unusually elevated expenses,” which he cautioned should not be treated as a run rate. Full-year 2025: record revenue and operating leverage Management said KeyCorp met or exceeded the financial targets it provided at the beginning of 2025. Gorman described 2025 as a “substantial year of progress,” including record full-year revenue that increased 16% from the prior year. Expenses rose 4.6%, which the company said translated into approximately 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and PP&R growth of about 44%. Khayat said net interest income increased 23%, outperforming the company’s original expectation for 20% growth, aided by stronger commercial loan growth and deposit performance. Fees grew 7.5% versus an original expectation of “5%-plus,” with investment banking fees up 13% despite muted middle-market M&A activity for much of the year. Gorman said the company added nearly 10% to frontline banker staff across wealth management, commercial payments, middle market, and investment banking, and invested an additional $100 million in technology focused on customer-facing capabilities. Credit and balance sheet: improving trends and continued remix Both Gorman and Khayat emphasized improving asset quality metrics. The fourth-quarter provision for credit losses was $108 million, including $104 million of net charge-offs and a $4 million reserve build. The net charge-off ratio was 39 basis points in the quarter, and full-year net charge-offs were 41 basis points, which Khayat said was toward the better end of the company’s 40 to 45 basis point target range. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially, criticized loans fell by $500 million (down 8% sequentially), and delinquencies also improved, according to management. On the balance sheet, KeyCorp said average loans were relatively flat sequentially. Khayat pointed to a $1 billion increase in C&I loans, offset by the intentional runoff of $550 million of lower-yielding consumer loans and some paydowns in commercial real estate. Spot commercial loan growth was about $1.2 billion, with growth in both C&I and CRE, which Khayat said was driven primarily by the power and utility sector and broad-based middle-market growth across regions. Deposit trends were described as favorable. Average deposits increased by about $300 million sequentially, with $2 billion of commercial client deposit growth offset by a decline of $1.3 billion in higher-cost brokered CDs. Total deposit costs declined 16 basis points to 1.81%, and the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta declined modestly to 51% through the fourth quarter. In Q&A, Khayat said the company expects a “low-to-mid 50s” beta in 2026 on a relatively stable deposit base. Management also discussed the continued runoff of the consumer loan portfolio, which Gorman described as largely super-prime mortgages to doctors and dentists yielding about 3.3%. He said KeyCorp expects roughly $600 million per quarter of runoff and that it could bottom out “in the next couple of years,” while the bank builds home equity capabilities and maintains its student loan refinancing platform for when vintages and rates align. Capital return ramps up; guidance and strategic priorities for 2026 Gorman said KeyCorp began a “more meaningful return of capital” in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of common stock—double the original commitment announced in October—at an average price of $18 per share. The company ended the quarter with a 10.3% marked CET1 ratio, which management described as peer-leading, and said it intends to manage the ratio down toward the higher end of its 9.5% to 10% targeted range by the end of 2026. Khayat said CET1 was 11.7% on a reported basis and reiterated plans to repurchase at least $300 million of shares in the first quarter and at least $1.2 billion for the full year 2026. Gorman added the company anticipates similar quarterly repurchase levels through 2026, supported by ongoing capital generation. For 2026, KeyCorp’s guidance included: Revenue up about 7%, driven by NII growth of 8% to 10% and non-interest income growth of 3% to 4%. Adjusting for business decisions described as net neutral to earnings, non-interest income is expected to grow 5% to 6%. Expenses up 3% to 4%, implying positive operating leverage of roughly 300 to 400 basis points. Average loans up 1% to 2%, with commercial loans up about 5% as consumer runoff continues and the bank remixes into higher-yielding relationship-based commercial loans. Net charge-off ratio stable at 40 to 45 basis points. Tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. In Q&A, Gorman said the company’s organic focus remains on three areas: middle market and payments, investment banking, and wealth—particularly mass affluent. He also emphasized ongoing investments in AI and technology, noting tech and ops investments increased from $800 million to $900 million last year and to $1 billion this year, with a goal of improving processes such as loan underwriting and processing. On M&A, Gorman said the company is “not focused on” bank acquisitions, reiterating that position when asked directly. However, he said KeyCorp is interested in “complementary fee-based and capability-enhancing acquisitions,” including group hires or boutiques, particularly in knowledge-worker-heavy businesses. Separately, management detailed board changes, including planned nominations of Tony DeSpirito (most recently Global CIO for Fundamental Equities at BlackRock) and Chris Henson (former head of banking and insurance at Truist and former president/COO/CFO at BB&T). The lead independent director role transitioned from Sandy Cutler to Todd Vassos, CEO of Dollar General. The company also said Carlton Highsmith and Ruth Ann Gillis plan to retire from the board at the annual meeting, and David Wilson retired immediately due to health considerations.About KeyCorp NYSE: KEYKeyCorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that operates through its primary banking subsidiary, KeyBank.

Fees grew 7.5% versus an original expectation of “5%-plus,” with investment banking fees up 13% despite muted middle-market M&A activity for much of the year. Gorman said the company added nearly 10% to frontline banker staff across wealth management, commercial payments, middle market, and investment banking, and invested an additional $100 million in technology focused on customer-facing capabilities. Credit and balance sheet: improving trends and continued remix Both Gorman and Khayat emphasized improving asset quality metrics. The fourth-quarter provision for credit losses was $108 million, including $104 million of net charge-offs and a $4 million reserve build. The net charge-off ratio was 39 basis points in the quarter, and full-year net charge-offs were 41 basis points, which Khayat said was toward the better end of the company’s 40 to 45 basis point target range. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially, criticized loans fell by $500 million (down 8% sequentially), and delinquencies also improved, according to management. On the balance sheet, KeyCorp said average loans were relatively flat sequentially. Khayat pointed to a $1 billion increase in C&I loans, offset by the intentional runoff of $550 million of lower-yielding consumer loans and some paydowns in commercial real estate. Spot commercial loan growth was about $1.2 billion, with growth in both C&I and CRE, which Khayat said was driven primarily by the power and utility sector and broad-based middle-market growth across regions. Deposit trends were described as favorable. Average deposits increased by about $300 million sequentially, with $2 billion of commercial client deposit growth offset by a decline of $1.3 billion in higher-cost brokered CDs. Total deposit costs declined 16 basis points to 1.81%, and the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta declined modestly to 51% through the fourth quarter. In Q&A, Khayat said the company expects a “low-to-mid 50s” beta in 2026 on a relatively stable deposit base. Management also discussed the continued runoff of the consumer loan portfolio, which Gorman described as largely super-prime mortgages to doctors and dentists yielding about 3.3%. He said KeyCorp expects roughly $600 million per quarter of runoff and that it could bottom out “in the next couple of years,” while the bank builds home equity capabilities and maintains its student loan refinancing platform for when vintages and rates align. Capital return ramps up; guidance and strategic priorities for 2026 Gorman said KeyCorp began a “more meaningful return of capital” in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of common stock—double the original commitment announced in October—at an average price of $18 per share. The company ended the quarter with a 10.3% marked CET1 ratio, which management described as peer-leading, and said it intends to manage the ratio down toward the higher end of its 9.5% to 10% targeted range by the end of 2026. Khayat said CET1 was 11.7% on a reported basis and reiterated plans to repurchase at least $300 million of shares in the first quarter and at least $1.2 billion for the full year 2026. Gorman added the company anticipates similar quarterly repurchase levels through 2026, supported by ongoing capital generation. For 2026, KeyCorp’s guidance included: Revenue up about 7%, driven by NII growth of 8% to 10% and non-interest income growth of 3% to 4%. Adjusting for business decisions described as net neutral to earnings, non-interest income is expected to grow 5% to 6%. Expenses up 3% to 4%, implying positive operating leverage of roughly 300 to 400 basis points. Average loans up 1% to 2%, with commercial loans up about 5% as consumer runoff continues and the bank remixes into higher-yielding relationship-based commercial loans. Net charge-off ratio stable at 40 to 45 basis points. Tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. In Q&A, Gorman said the company’s organic focus remains on three areas: middle market and payments, investment banking, and wealth—particularly mass affluent. He also emphasized ongoing investments in AI and technology, noting tech and ops investments increased from $800 million to $900 million last year and to $1 billion this year, with a goal of improving processes such as loan underwriting and processing. On M&A, Gorman said the company is “not focused on” bank acquisitions, reiterating that position when asked directly. However, he said KeyCorp is interested in “complementary fee-based and capability-enhancing acquisitions,” including group hires or boutiques, particularly in knowledge-worker-heavy businesses. Separately, management detailed board changes, including planned nominations of Tony DeSpirito (most recently Global CIO for Fundamental Equities at BlackRock) and Chris Henson (former head of banking and insurance at Truist and former president/COO/CFO at BB&T). The lead independent director role transitioned from Sandy Cutler to Todd Vassos, CEO of Dollar General. The company also said Carlton Highsmith and Ruth Ann Gillis plan to retire from the board at the annual meeting, and David Wilson retired immediately due to health considerations.About KeyCorp NYSE: KEYKeyCorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that operates through its primary banking subsidiary, KeyBank.

Departments, agencies and public bodies News stories, speeches, letters and notices Detailed guidance, regulations and rules Reports, analysis and official statistics Consultations and strategy Data, Freedom of Information releases and corporate reports Cities and regions initiative to 'enhance capability, attract investment, and accelerate growth for the benefit of all of Scotland' Business leaders joined representatives from the UK Government and Scottish local authorities today [Tuesday 20 January] at the launch of a new initiative to boost investment in Scotland’s eight cities and its regions. As part of Scottish Cities Week 2026, Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill launched the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme at an event bringing together Scottish city leaders, investors, finance sector stakeholders, and officials from the Scotland Office, Department for Business and Trade and the Office for Investment. A collaborative initiative between the UK Government, TheCityUK and the Scottish Cities Alliance (SCA), the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme will provide structured support, technical guidance and market intelligence to enable local authorities and cities attract inward investment from around the globe. Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill said: Scotland’s cities and regions hold immense potential for inward investment: We have the talent, the ingenuity, and the resources. This is about building a competitive advantage for Scotland, ensuring our regions and communities are ready to secure the vital capital that drives growth and creates jobs. Together, we will enhance capability, attract investment, and accelerate growth for the benefit of all of Scotland. Cllr Raymond Bremner, Chair, Scottish Cities Alliance and Leader, Highland Council said: Scottish Cities Alliance is proud to support the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme. Building capability and fostering collaboration between governments, investors, and our Scottish city partners is essential to unlocking transformative investment. Through initiatives like Scottish Cities Week London, we champion inclusive, sustainable growth and showcase Scotland’s strengths to ensure our cities thrive in a competitive global economy. Miles Celic OBE, Chief Executive Officer, TheCityUK, said: Scotland’s world-class financial and professional services are key drivers of growth and innovation [and a core element of the wider British industry]. We are excited to team up with our public sector partners to boost investment and enhance collaboration between industry and government. This partnership will unlock new opportunities, create high-value jobs, and ensure Scotland remains at the forefront of the UK’s international competitiveness. The Programme will run throughout 2026, starting with the inaugural Scottish Cities Week Round Table in London, and continuing through events in Scotland. It will include teach-ins, workshops and webinars to build local authority leaders’ knowledge and capacity, technical sessions on investor expectations and project assessment criteria, guidance to help strengthen investment propositions, networking and peer learning forums to foster collaboration and share best practices, and support for showcasing opportunities and major investment events. At the Whitehall launch event today, Minister McNeill highlighted The UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy – a 10-year plan geared towards making it quicker and easier for businesses to invest in growth-driving sectors. Recent UK Government initiatives and funding streams that benefit Scotland were also highlighted to attendees, such as the £140 million Local Growth Fund and £280 million Pride in Place Programme to support improvements in Scotland’s most deprived areas. Participants heard expert insights on Scotland’s appeal to institutional capital, explored innovative financing approaches for local development, and engaged in open discussions to address current challenges and share practical experiences. Scottish Cities Week is the Scottish Cities Alliance’s annual flagship event targeting London-based investors, developers, and partners to showcase growth opportunities in Scotland’s cities. Events lay the foundation for collaboration between Scottish cities and the UK and Scottish governments to boost investor confidence. The roundtable was attended by stakeholders from Barclays, The CityUK, Scottish Cities Alliance, City of London Corporation, Phoenix Group, Scottish Cities Alliance, Aviva, Blackrock.

Title: Bridge Loan Platform Atlas Invest Raises $25M
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2026/01/bridge-loan-atlas-invest-blackrock/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T15:00:59Z
Full Content:
© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Atlas Invest, an artificial intelligence-powered commercial real estate lending platform, announced Tuesday that it has raised $25 million in funding to expand access for institutional-quality debt investments. BlackRock led the mixed debt and equity partnership with Manhattan-based Atlas Invest. Along with $13 million previously raised, the new infusion increased the startup’s overall funding to $38 million, said Tal Shahar, co-founder and CEO at Atlas Invest. “We started the company a bit more than three years ago,” Shahar said. “Atlas is an AI operating system, and that means we see customers who are borrowers looking for financing. They reach out to Atlas and get quick and simple financing with certainty. On the other side, we enable institutional investors to invest in this space of real estate financing, real estate debt, through customized managed accounts.” Reflecting the growing institutional adoption of AI-driven bridge lending, Atlas Invest uses its proprietary technology for data-driven processes across sourcing, underwriting and servicing with risk-adjusted practices to redefine how private investors access, engage with and scale real estate debt investments nationwide. The company aims to scale significantly with the new funding, targeting a greater than 10-fold increase in transactions in 2026 over 2025, said Shahar. “The market is shifting, investors are demanding income strategies that combine security, predictable returns and professional oversight,” Nir Peled, Atlas Invest’s chief revenue officer and co-founder, said in a statement. “We built Atlas to deliver institutional-grade underwriting and monitoring at software speed, combining a deep operating platform with a disciplined credit approach. This scale and consistency allow us to raise the bar for transparency and reliability in real estate debt.” Atlas Invest speeds the entire lending process for borrowers, said Shahar. “A borrower can send an email and say, ‘Hey, my name is John. I want a loan for this property,’ and on the same day they’re going to get a term sheet, and in a couple of days they can get the financing,” Shahar explained. “Our system does the full analysis super quick, because it uses AI technology. In a few days we will give you the capital itself. So it’s very fast, with certainty, and a simple process.” Currently, due diligence to assess risk on deals is a lengthy, costly and limited process in terms of the visibility and value it provides. Atlas Invest claims to offer institutional-grade due diligence at regular intervals, tapping into a broader pool of information spanning facets of the developer and the asset, and continuously monitoring to mitigate risk. Atlas Invest’s key distinction is that its AI does not replace credit judgment, but compresses time, expands depth, and enforces consistency, allowing its team to make higher-quality decisions at scale with full auditability and human oversight, according to the company. The company works with hundreds of brokers and the borrowers behind them, as well as institutional investors from multiple continents, said Shahar. “We have insurance companies, banks and family offices,” he said. “And they’re coming to the platform because they want to invest their money in real estate debt. So they open their account, and the platform is doing everything for them, from sourcing opportunities, doing a very deep analysis, and then building their portfolio of investments and monitoring that for them.” Philip Russo can be reached at prusso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: 8 signs the AI bubble may pop in 2026

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The AI industry is ridiculous. All you need is a cursory glance to spot utterly bonkers valuations, bizarre circular funding models, and a dearth of viable products and profitability. You don’t need to be an expert to know there’s something off about an industry built around companies promising to spend trillions while barely making billions. I have no insider information, crystal ball, horoscope, or deep AI-powered analytics of the industry to back up my idea that the AI bubble will burst in 2026. But the signs are all there and it seems awfully likely. Here are just a few of the many red flags. Major tech companies like Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Oracle have all seen their stock prices explode over the past few years as they’ve consolidated their AI efforts, pulled in gargantuan amounts of funding based on AI hype, and announced incredible infrastructure projects that have upset almost every industry, from smartphone production to water management. Nvidia They, in turn, are funding a few select data companies. (How do you think companies like ScaleAI grew so big, so fast?) But as for everyone else, they’re not doing so good. Indeed, if it weren’t for the big tech companies, the US economy would almost certainly be in a recession right now, according to Deutsche Bank research. That might be OK if these companies were developing something genuinely innovative, profitable, and/or showing real potential to deliver on their investments. But the biggest reason for their sky-high valuations is simple: they’re all just investing in each other. When Oracle announced its $300 billion Stargate Project with OpenAI, Nvidia was set to be the major hardware supplier. Nvidia also invested $100 billion of its own in OpenAI, and Nvidia is also a major investor in CoreWeave (another Oracle supplier). CoreWeave works closely with Microsoft, which is itself a major OpenAI investor. Microsoft and Nvidia have also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which has done major infrastructure deals with Amazon and Google. The list goes on. And while these enormous investments might have sent company valuations skyward, many of them are based on multi-year plans with estimates for future hardware delivery and assumptions around costs and scalability. For it all to succeed, it’s got to be done before whatever AI bubble there is bursts. In totality, these investments are completely unprecedented, too. By 2030, McKinsey estimates that AI investment could reach almost $7 trillion. For comparison, the entire Manhattan Project cost only $30 billion (adjusted for inflation). Yikes. Nvidia might be making a killing on AI as the seller of GPU-shaped shovels in this proverbial gold rush, but everyone else is struggling. Microsoft has revised AI sales targets due to poor uptake of its paid-for services, and OpenAI has churned through over $150 billion in investment dollars just to make $15 billion or so in revenue in 2025. If OpenAI can’t figure out how to turn a profit with the backing of all its AI friends, with close to a billion active users, and with the most dominant mindshare in the AI chatbot space, who else will? For institutionalized tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—the ones with diversified businesses, long-tail revenue options, and expansive cash stockpiles—this may not be a problem in the short or medium terms. But even major companies can’t burn through money forever. Microsoft and many others have enacted huge layoffs over the past year to help maintain healthier balance sheets, and investors are going to come calling for their returns sooner or later. Smaller AI companies will be affected first, but as we saw with Meta’s disastrously unprofitable endeavors to develop the Metaverse, even massive tech companies can run dry on interest and momentum. What happens then to the trillions in AI investment? From Nvidia’s DGI Spark system to home hackers running large language models on their gaming GPUs, it’s easier than ever to run local AI on your own machine. They aren’t the top models with their trillions of parameters, mind you, but the latest large language models designed for home hardware are becoming increasingly capable. Mark Hachman / IDG OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and others would love a future where you run all your AI services through their cloud platforms that are gated with subscription fees, but the latest local LLMs are capable enough to handle basic text generation, editing, summarizing, and image generation. With the added benefits of improved privacy, security, and response time for local LLMs, more and more individuals and companies are going to pivot this way in the months and years to come. That’s not going to do any favors for AI companies seeking profitability. This one might be more of a meta point on economic bubbles than a specific point for the AI industry, but massive market rallies only tend to last a few years. Yahoo Finance highlights how the dot-com bubble lasted just over two years, the Japanese stock bubble of the 1980s lasted three years, and the big tech-disrupted rally after COVID just under a year. In each of these cases, their respective stock markets saw enormous growth of several hundred percent in just a few years. The AI boom hasn’t quite managed that—it has experienced a gain of around 130 percent over the past three years—but three years is already longer than most of these historic booms. If AI is a bubble that’s going to bust, then it’s almost past due going by historic trends. All the major AI companies have announced their deals and are starting to make them reality. We aren’t going to see new rounds of trillion-dollar deals from even the major tech firms, as even they have limits on the capital they have available to them. But scaling up to these grandiose goals of AI data centers all over the world is proving difficult. After buying up all the GPUs and memory they can, some of these companies are still struggling to bring them online. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in November that the company now had a power problem, meaning it had GPUs that couldn’t physically plug in because it lacked the power to run them. And then you have Elon Musk’s xAI trying to import a power station (no, really) and supersonic jet company Boom Supersonic converting its jet engines into gas generators (no, really!). AI needs power, but power is at a premium. Power stations and their associated grid infrastructures take years or even decades to build. When power supply fails to catch up to their ambitions, it’s going to slam the brakes on expansion. A slowdown like that is the last thing the AI industry needs to keep its hype train rolling. No one likes Grok’s deepfakes and child exploitation images. Fake frames in Nvidia-run games are making gamers feel like they’re not really playing their games. AI-driven memory shortages and associated price spikes for everyday tech products are driving people crazy. Dell Companies are noticing and already pivoting, too. The most stark example so far this year is Dell relaunching its XPS brand at CES 2026. Sure, it’s still a “Copilot+ PC,” but you’d never know it from the marketing. AI is gone from the forefront and back is the focus on longevity, everyday performance, and lightweight design—you know, the things that consumers actually care about. If no one’s even interested in buying AI, how are these companies ever going to make it profitable? That’s not something investors are going to want to see or hear this year. On top of all the internal AI industry factors that could bring about its fall, there’s also global instability that could just as likely to deal a death blow. The US administration’s volatile leadership keeps throwing up (and tearing down) trade barriers. Hardware nationalization and nationalism are driving secular investments rather than global branch-outs. TSMC And as the superpowers keep eyeing up what their neighbors have, there’s the risk of war stalling out the world economy. Just China closing off Taiwan’s access to global markets would be enough to collapse just about everything in the tech sphere. Hopefully nothing like that comes to pass, but the prospect of it is one more Sword of Damocles hanging over the AI industry. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft won’t collapse. OpenAI probably won’t collapse. But the AI hype train of today could be heavily derailed. The smaller and medium AI companies, and all the firms promising agentic revolutions for your business? They’ll be gone. Stock prices will collapse, and global recession could be the medium-term fallout that eventually corrects everything back to some semblance of normalcy. Long term, though, even the companies that remain will have to contend with hardware deprecation that’ll see them scurrying back to Nvidia every 2 to 3 years. Even with all that hardware power, none of these companies are going to reach AGI (or even super-intelligence) with large language models that can’t functionally understand anything. AI is here to stay, but the industry as it is can’t last much longer. The signs are there that 2026 could be the year it all changes—again. Jon Martindale is a voracious writer and technology fanboy who loves nothing more than digging into the specs of the latest graphics cards, processors, and displays. He's passionate about everything PC, but also enjoys experimenting with AIs, and covering new standing desks that can help avoid his worst posture habits.

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Leinster's academy prop Sam Bishti has been confirmed as captain for Ireland Under-20s in the 2026 Six Nations Championship, after head coach Andrew Browne named a 29-player squad for the early rounds of the tournament. Bishti, who has been playing for UCD in the Energia All-Ireland League this season, skippered Blackrock College to Leinster Schools Senior Cup success last year, and will lead the Ireland U20s as they bid to recover from last year’s calamitous championship, where they finished bottom of the table with just one win. Just four of that 2025 squad remain in place this year, with Leinster trio Donnacha McGuire, Charlie Molony and Derry Moloney, as well as Munster’s Tom Wood – son of former Ireland captain Keith - playing a second year of U20s. Browne has also included recent Leinster academy back row Josh Neill in his squad. The highly-rated teenager (below, right) only linked up with the province’s academy this month following his arrival from his native South Africa, and the Irish-qualified flanker scored two tries in Saturday’s 29-10 warm-up win against Italy in Dublin. Ireland get their Championship campaign under way in France before returning home to Virgin Media Park in Cork to face Italy on Friday, 13 February. Browne’s side then travel to Bath to face England on Friday, 20 February, before welcoming Wales and Scotland to Cork for back-to-back home fixtures to finish the campaign on Saturday, 7 March and Sunday, 15 March respectively. "We have been working hard together as an extended squad for a number of months and it’s an exciting time for these young players, who have the honour of representing the wider group in the Six Nations," head coach Browne said. "We, as coaches, have pushed the players over the last number of months and I have been impressed by their work-rate, commitment, and application. Now our focus turns to performance and the opening game against France, which we know will be a big challenge first up." Forwards: Tyrese Abolarin (Queen’s University/Ulster), Sami Bishti (UCD/Leinster)(captain), Ben Blaney (Terenure/Leinster), Jonathan Byrne (Garryowen/Munster) Max Doyle (UCD/Leinster), Joe Finn (Garryowen/Munster), Christian Foley (Young Munster/Munster), Rian Handley (Old Wesley/Leinster), Bill Hayes (Garryowen/Munster), Alex Lautsou (Shannon/Munster), Duinn Maguire (UCD/Leinster), Blake McClean (Instonians/Ulster), Donnacha McGuire (UCD/Leinster), Dylan McNeice (UCD/Leinster) Josh Neill (Old Wesley/Leinster), Diarmaid O’Connell (Corinthians/Connacht), Sean Walsh (MU Barnhall/Leinster) Backs: Christopher Barrett (UCC/Munster), Ethan Black (Old Wesley/Leinster), Noah Byrne (Dublin University/Leinster), Luke Fogarty (MU Barnhall/Leinster), Derry Moloney (Blackrock College/Leinster), Charlie Molony (UCD/Leinster), James O’Dwyer (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Charlie O’Shea (UCC/Munster), Johnny O’Sullivan (Dublin University/Leinster), Daniel Ryan (Corinthians/Connacht), Harry Waters (Blackrock College/Leinster), Tom Wood (Garryowen/Munster). © RTÉ 2026.

We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology.” - Lynn Martin, President of NYSE Group Back in December, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein said that finance is “entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure,” one that could move assets “faster and more securely than systems that have served investors for decades.” 🧠 Why It Matters The world’s most important stock exchange is building for a crypto-native market structure. This is a big deal for a few reasons: Now what does it mean for prices? Again, it will be slow moving. But the blockchains that become the home of the majority of tokenization (potentially Ethereum and Solana) are set up to be winners. And as the overall pie grows and crypto is taken more seriously, the bull case for crypto majors becomes easier to digest. This won’t happen overnight. But once the world’s most important exchange goes tokenized, there’s no looking back.

Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Business Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools. More than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland. They included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy. JetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.

The most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider. Buying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower. The world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August. At 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours. Other major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay. Private jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro. London was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose. 10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai. Dozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week. Tuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy. Jump to

Stock futures are sinking Tuesday morning amid rising geopolitical concerns; President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on a number of European countries unless the U.S. is allowed to acquire Greenland; gold and silver prices are surging to new record highs as investors turn to safe-haven assets; tech stocks are under pressure amid the volatiity; and Netflix's latest quarterly results are due after the closing bell as the company sweetens its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. Here's what you need to know today. Stocks are tumbling after President Trump over the weekend threatened new tariffs on several European countries if the U.S. isn't allowed to acquire Greenland. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 1.2%, 1.4%, and 1.7%, respectively. The major indexes posted modest losses last week amid concerns that Federal Reserve independence could be compromised. Gold futures were up 3% at $4,730 an ounce recently, a new all-time high, while silver futures surged nearly 8% to $95.30 an ounce, also a record, as investors turned to safe havens. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 4.29%, up from its previous close of 4.23% and at its highest level since early September. Bitcoin was just above $91,000, down from a weekend high of above $95,000 and on track to decline for a sixth straight day as its early-year rally stalls. Financial markets are volatile this morning after President Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will each face a 10% tariff at the start of February that will increase to 25% on June 1 if the U.S. is not allowed to purchase Greenland. The Trump administration in recent weeks has stepped up its interest in acquiring Greenland, saying it aims to do so with money or with military force. Early Tuesday, Trump posted fake images of himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance putting an American flag in the ground next to a sign calling Greenland U.S. territory, along with a photoshopped map showing Canada with an American flag on it. Gold is leading another safe-haven-asset rally, hitting a record of nearly $4,740 an ounce earlier this morning. Silver is also adding to its gains to start the year, setting its own record high just above $95 an ounce. Gold and other precious metals typically increase in value when investors are uncertain of the economy or the state of geopolitics and therefore less likely to invest in more-volatile assets such as stocks or cryptocurrency. The precious metals have already been gaining steadily this year amid concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve. Gold futures have risen 70% over the past 12 months, while silver has surged about 200%. All seven of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing ground this morning amid the larger market sell-off that is hitting tech stocks particularly hard. Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) are all down between 1% and 3% in premarket trading. Chipmaker stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) are also down sharply. Tech stocks have powered much of the market's growth in recent years amid the AI boom, making the stocks also vulnerable to being hit hard when there is a broad sell-off like the one happening today. Netflix (NFLX) stock has resisted the sell-off so far this morning, as investors await the streaming giant's latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell and digest news that the company is now offering all cash to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Netflix executives will likely face questions from analysts during the earnings call about the pending acquisition, on topics including regulatory hurdles, competition from Paramount Skydance (PSKY), how the deal will be financed, and the timeline for when the deal could be completed. Netflix is expected to report that revenue rose 17% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while earnings per share are projected 30% higher, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Netflix shares were up about 1% ahead of Monday's opening bell.

Ireland Under-20 head coach Andrew Browne has named a 29-man squad for the Under-20 Six Nations championship that opens with a game against France in Perpignan on Saturday, February 7th. Four players return from last year’s squad, outhalf Tom Wood, wing Derry Moloney, fullback/wing Charlie Molony and secondrow Donnacha McGuire. Browne has named tighthead prop Sami Bishti as captain. Ireland warmed up for the tournament with internationals against South Africa (22-32), where 14 of the Six Nations squad played, and Italy (29-10), when 21 of those chosen played. Connacht centre Seán Walsh, a try scorer and impressive performer against South Africa, picked up an injury in a Challenge Cup match against Montauban and was ruled out. Josh Neill, the South African-born, Irish-qualified flanker, who has linked up with the Leinster academy, scored two tries in the victory over England. His brother Jordan has played ODI cricket for Ireland. The boys qualify through Irish grandparents. Ireland will play their three home games, against Italy, Wales and Scotland in Cork, will face France in Perpignan and England at The Rec in Bath. Tickets for the home games are available to purchase through Ticketmaster.ie. Browne said: “We have been working hard together as an extended squad for a number of months and it’s an exciting time for these young players, who have the honour of representing the wider group in the Six Nations. “We, as coaches, have pushed the players over the last number of months and I have been impressed by their work-rate, commitment, and application. Now our focus turns to performance and the opening game against France, which we know will be a big challenge first up. “We are looking forward to the opportunities over the coming weeks and are excited by the prospect of an Ireland Under-20s team returning to Six Nations action at Virgin Media Park in Cork, where we always have huge support.” Forwards (17): Tyrese Abolarin (QUB/Ulster), Sami Bishti (UCD/Leinster, capt), Ben Blaney (Terenure/Leinster), Jonathan Byrne (Garryowen/Munster), Max Doyle (UCD/Leinster), Joe Finn (Garryowen/Munster), Christian Foley (Young Munster/Munster), Rian Handley (Old Wesley/Leinster), Bill Hayes (Garryowen/Munster), Alex Lautsou (Shannon/Munster), Duinn Maguire (UCD/Leinster), Blake McClean (Instonians/Ulster), Donnacha McGuire (UCD/Leinster), Dylan McNeice (UCD/Leinster), Josh Neill (Old Wesley/Leinster), Diarmaid O’Connell (Corinthians/Connacht), Seán Walsh (MU Barnhall/Leinster).

Title: AI boom could falter without wider adoption, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella warns

Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) risks becoming a speculative bubble unless its use spreads beyond big tech companies and wealthy economies. Mr Nadella on Tuesday said that the long-term success of the fast-developing technology would depend on it being used by a broad range of industries as well as on uptake outside of the developed world. “For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” said Mr Nadella. He noted that a “telltale sign of if it’s a bubble” would be if only tech groups were benefiting from the rise of AI, rather than companies in other sectors. However, Mr Nadella said he was confident that AI would prove to be transformative across industries, such as helping to develop new drugs. “I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he said. The Microsoft chief’s comments came as part of a talk with BlackRock chief Larry Fink on the first day of the World Economic Forum annual meeting at Davos, kicking off the first of several speeches by tech executives, including Google DeepMind chief, Sir Demis Hassabis and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei. A growing body of data from tech companies, including Microsoft, has shown a global divide in AI adoption rates, pointing to productivity benefits and work applications being concentrated in richer developed countries. Mr Nadella also reiterated his view that the future of AI adoption would not rely on one dominant model provider, which has driven the tech giant’s decision to work with several AI groups, such as Anthropic and xAI, as well as OpenAI. Microsoft gained an early advantage in AI through its $14 billion (€11.9 billion) bet on OpenAI, which gave the software group unique access to the ChatGPT maker’s technology and first claim on its data centre contracts. But after restructuring its partnership with Sam Altman’s start-up in October, Microsoft has dropped exclusivity over its data centre needs and will lose exclusive access to its research and models in the early 2030s. Mr Nadella said companies would be able to take advantage of multiple models, including open-source ones, or even building their own models using a technique called “distillation” to produce smaller, cheaper versions of powerful models. “So the [intellectual property] of any application or any firm is, how do you use all these models with context engineering or your data?” Mr Nadella said. “As long as firms can answer that question, they’re gonna be getting ahead.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026 From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Chips, models, hash rates, capital raises. That framing is already outdated. At this stage of the cycle, growth is no longer decided by demand or funding. It is decided by power. Not theoretical power. Not future contracts. Existing, usable electricity that can support a continuous load. That is the asset hyperscalers are quietly competing for, and it is where expansion is actually happening. Companies that already have access to it within live facilities can move. Those that do not are discovering that capital alone does not unlock growth. That framework is what makes Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) worth a closer look, because the company is not approaching this shift from the sidelines. It already operates across four U.S. colocation sites running continuous, power-intensive workloads, with uptime above 95%. Its current fleet of more than 3,100 wholly owned Scrypt mining rigs is live today, spread across diversified data-center load zones, and management has disclosed a funded expansion to more than 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026. This is not a future buildout. The facilities are live, powered, and operating today, with revenue being generated under continuous load. Look at where the biggest buyers are actually adding load. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has concentrated new AI capacity inside existing campuses in places like Iowa and Texas, where power delivery and transmission are already settled. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has done the same in long-established regions such as Virginia and Ohio. These are not speculative locations. They are places where electricity shows up on time and at scale. Expansion is flowing to what already works, while projects tied to future power remain stuck. That is the environment in which Datacentrex operates. It is not waiting on approvals or interconnection. Its sites are already live. Power is flowing, load is running, and revenue is being generated under continuous operation. At this stage of the cycle, the question is not who wants to expand, but who already can. What matters next is how that position is used. Datacentrex is not holding power idle. Today, it is monetized through Scrypt mining. The infrastructure is already paid for, and cash is already coming in. At the same time, the company sits adjacent to a data center and AI market already measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Secured access to live power does not promise outcomes, but it determines who even gets a seat when demand shifts. For now, Datacentrex uses its contracted, energized capacity the way infrastructure businesses usually do: by putting it to work. Datacentrex’s current revenue engine is Scrypt mining, a faster-growing and less saturated corner of crypto infrastructure that has outperformed expectations over the past cycle. Scrypt mining secures networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin using specialized hardware designed for steady, always-on operation. It is a different market from Bitcoin mining. The field is smaller. Competition is thinner. Scale is not dominated by a handful of megasites, and that helps shape returns. Over the past year, that gap has been visible in operating results. While Bitcoin miners have dealt with rising difficulty, higher capital intensity, and margin pressure following the halving, Scrypt economics have held up better. Company materials show that Scrypt mining delivered stronger realized profitability than SHA-256 mining for much of 2024. And it’s all because of the structure. A clearer way to gauge mining economics is to look at what the networks pay miners. CoinMetrics network data show that total miner revenue on Scrypt networks such as Dogecoin and Litecoin stayed comparatively steady through 2024. Bitcoin miner revenue did not. The halving cut payouts sharply, and margins across the SHA-256 ecosystem tightened. Scrypt mining also allows a single machine to earn rewards from two networks at the same time, most commonly Litecoin and Dogecoin. Power use does not increase, but output does. That feature is known as merged mining. For many operators, merged mining creates a secondary problem. Rewards arrive in more than one cryptocurrency, each with its own liquidity and conversion process. Turning production into usable cash can involve multiple steps, additional timing risk, and unnecessary friction. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) handles this differently. Mining output is consolidated into bitcoin rather than managed across several smaller assets. The result is a simpler cash flow. Fewer conversions. Less exposure to liquidity bottlenecks. Revenue moves from production to cash without detours. That shows up in operating results. Datacentrex has disclosed that its Scrypt operations have been EBITDA positive from the start. Power costs are covered. Sites fund themselves. Expansion is incremental rather than speculative. Source: https://x.com/ElphaPex/status/2003624000581464457 This defines Scrypt's role in the business today. It is not framed as a destination. It is the current workload on energized sites. Cash is generated, infrastructure stays active, and the company retains the option to reallocate capacity over time. In a market where power is scarce, that combination matters. Treasury Strategy: Liquidity First Datacentrex pays attention to how revenue becomes usable capital, not just how it is produced. Scrypt mining generates value across multiple networks. As a result, many operators end up managing several different crypto assets. That complicates cash flow. Conversion timing matters. Liquidity varies. None of that improves mining performance, but it can affect outcomes. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) avoids that problem by consolidating mining proceeds into a single settlement asset. Revenue is realized quickly and cleanly. There is no need to manage multiple small positions or wait for favorable conversion windows. The result is a liquid treasury because operating costs are covered without the need to sell. Capital can be held, deployed, or left idle depending on conditions. Decisions are not dictated by short-term price moves or balance-sheet pressure. That flexibility is the point. The treasury does not try to add returns on its own. It preserves the ability to act when opportunities appear and to sit still when they do not. Execution: Scale, Control, and Cash Discipline Execution at Datacentrex begins with ownership. The company owns its machines and operates directly within third-party colocation facilities directly. There are no leased rigs and no vendor liens embedded in the fleet. Decisions around uptime, expansion, and capital allocation stay simple because nothing lies between the company and its assets. Today, Datacentrex runs more than 3,100 Scrypt ASICs across four U.S. colocation sites. Power is delivered and consumed under continuous load. These facilities are operating now, and utilization is happening in real time. Growth builds from that base. Management has disclosed plans to expand the fleet beyond 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026, adding capacity inside facilities that are already running. Power, cooling, and operating processes are in place. Capital goes toward machines, not construction. The economics are already visible. Datacentrex has said its Scrypt subsidiary, dogehash technologies’ operations have been EBITDA positive from inception. Power costs are covered. Sites carry themselves. Expansion follows cash flow. The company is also carrying cash. Datacentrex has disclosed roughly $45 million on hand, no long-term debt, and full ownership of its operating equipment. It is not forced to raise capital to keep operating or to add capacity. The people involved have been through cycles where that distinction mattered. Members of the board and management have built and run crypto and data infrastructure businesses during periods when power tightened and capital disappeared. They have seen where leverage breaks things first. That experience shows up in how the business is run. Assets are owned outright. Capacity is added where operations already work. Liquidity stays intact. The company is not built to chase scale just to justify fixed costs. Management has been explicit about how it sees the model evolving. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) has pointed to companies such as IREN, Cipher Mining, and TeraWulf as examples of businesses where the market stopped valuing hash rate alone and started valuing who has secured access to power,, balance sheets, and operating flexibility. The asset is not the output. It is the infrastructure underneath it. For investors, execution here is straightforward. The system is operating, and cash is coming in, while capacity can be added without rebuilding the business. Capital, Revenue, and the Size of the Playing Field The scale of what is unfolding in data centers and AI infrastructure is already well defined. J.P. Morgan estimates that U.S. data center capacity could exceed 130 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 20–30 gigawatts today, with total infrastructure and hardware investment required to support that buildout running north of $3 trillion. Power, not demand, is the gating factor. Generation exists. Transmission, interconnection, and delivery do not move at the same speed. J.P. Morgan’s work shows where capacity already exists. U.S.-listed bitcoin miners are operating more than 8.5 gigawatts of energized power, with approvals in place for roughly another 8 gigawatts. These are not plans on paper. The sites are connected, permitted, and already drawing load. Moving from mining to higher value computing is expensive, but the most difficult step is already complete. Electricity is reaching the site. J.P. Morgan estimates that converting existing mining power capacity to HPC applications could cost roughly $10-15 million per megawatt before GPUs, with all-in AI data center costs exceeding $45 million per megawatt once hardware is included. That math explains why expansion across the sector is gravitating toward sites that already work, rather than projects that still need power. This is where Datacentrex fits in. The company is not trying to solve the power problem. It is operating after it. Its business decisions concern how to use existing capacity, not how to secure it. At this point in the cycle, outcomes hinge on where electricity is already being consumed. Other companies to keep a close eye on in the space: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVIDIA is the dominant global supplier of GPUs and accelerated computing platforms that underpin artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and modern data centers. Its data center segment has become the company’s primary growth engine, driven by demand for AI training and inference workloads from hyperscalers, sovereign cloud projects, and enterprise customers. NVIDIA’s strength lies not only in hardware, such as its H100 and upcoming Blackwell platforms, but also in its tightly integrated CUDA software ecosystem, networking solutions, and AI development tools. As power availability and infrastructure constraints become limiting factors for AI deployment, NVIDIA’s ability to deliver higher performance per watt further strengthens its competitive position across global data center buildouts.

Chips, models, hash rates, capital raises. That framing is already outdated. At this stage of the cycle, growth is no longer decided by demand or funding. It is decided by power. Not theoretical power. Not future contracts. Existing, usable electricity that can support a continuous load. That is the asset hyperscalers are quietly competing for, and it is where expansion is actually happening. Companies that already have access to it within live facilities can move. Those that do not are discovering that capital alone does not unlock growth. That framework is what makes Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) worth a closer look, because the company is not approaching this shift from the sidelines. It already operates across four U.S. colocation sites running continuous, power-intensive workloads, with uptime above 95%. Its current fleet of more than 3,100 wholly owned Scrypt mining rigs is live today, spread across diversified data-center load zones, and management has disclosed a funded expansion to more than 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026. This is not a future buildout. The facilities are live, powered, and operating today, with revenue being generated under continuous load. Look at where the biggest buyers are actually adding load. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has concentrated new AI capacity inside existing campuses in places like Iowa and Texas, where power delivery and transmission are already settled. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has done the same in long-established regions such as Virginia and Ohio. These are not speculative locations. They are places where electricity shows up on time and at scale. Expansion is flowing to what already works, while projects tied to future power remain stuck. That is the environment in which Datacentrex operates. It is not waiting on approvals or interconnection. Its sites are already live. Power is flowing, load is running, and revenue is being generated under continuous operation. At this stage of the cycle, the question is not who wants to expand, but who already can. What matters next is how that position is used. Datacentrex is not holding power idle. Today, it is monetized through Scrypt mining. The infrastructure is already paid for, and cash is already coming in. At the same time, the company sits adjacent to a data center and AI market already measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Secured access to live power does not promise outcomes, but it determines who even gets a seat when demand shifts. For now, Datacentrex uses its contracted, energized capacity the way infrastructure businesses usually do: by putting it to work. Datacentrex’s current revenue engine is Scrypt mining, a faster-growing and less saturated corner of crypto infrastructure that has outperformed expectations over the past cycle. Scrypt mining secures networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin using specialized hardware designed for steady, always-on operation. It is a different market from Bitcoin mining. The field is smaller. Competition is thinner. Scale is not dominated by a handful of megasites, and that helps shape returns. Over the past year, that gap has been visible in operating results. While Bitcoin miners have dealt with rising difficulty, higher capital intensity, and margin pressure following the halving, Scrypt economics have held up better. Company materials show that Scrypt mining delivered stronger realized profitability than SHA-256 mining for much of 2024. And it’s all because of the structure. A clearer way to gauge mining economics is to look at what the networks pay miners. CoinMetrics network data show that total miner revenue on Scrypt networks such as Dogecoin and Litecoin stayed comparatively steady through 2024. Bitcoin miner revenue did not. The halving cut payouts sharply, and margins across the SHA-256 ecosystem tightened. Scrypt mining also allows a single machine to earn rewards from two networks at the same time, most commonly Litecoin and Dogecoin. Power use does not increase, but output does. That feature is known as merged mining. For many operators, merged mining creates a secondary problem. Rewards arrive in more than one cryptocurrency, each with its own liquidity and conversion process. Turning production into usable cash can involve multiple steps, additional timing risk, and unnecessary friction. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) handles this differently. Mining output is consolidated into bitcoin rather than managed across several smaller assets. The result is a simpler cash flow. Fewer conversions. Less exposure to liquidity bottlenecks. Revenue moves from production to cash without detours. That shows up in operating results. Datacentrex has disclosed that its Scrypt operations have been EBITDA positive from the start. Power costs are covered. Sites fund themselves. Expansion is incremental rather than speculative. Source: https://x.com/ElphaPex/status/2003624000581464457 This defines Scrypt's role in the business today. It is not framed as a destination. It is the current workload on energized sites. Cash is generated, infrastructure stays active, and the company retains the option to reallocate capacity over time. In a market where power is scarce, that combination matters. Treasury Strategy: Liquidity First Datacentrex pays attention to how revenue becomes usable capital, not just how it is produced. Scrypt mining generates value across multiple networks. As a result, many operators end up managing several different crypto assets. That complicates cash flow. Conversion timing matters. Liquidity varies. None of that improves mining performance, but it can affect outcomes. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) avoids that problem by consolidating mining proceeds into a single settlement asset. Revenue is realized quickly and cleanly. There is no need to manage multiple small positions or wait for favorable conversion windows. The result is a liquid treasury because operating costs are covered without the need to sell. Capital can be held, deployed, or left idle depending on conditions. Decisions are not dictated by short-term price moves or balance-sheet pressure. That flexibility is the point. The treasury does not try to add returns on its own. It preserves the ability to act when opportunities appear and to sit still when they do not. Execution: Scale, Control, and Cash Discipline Execution at Datacentrex begins with ownership. The company owns its machines and operates directly within third-party colocation facilities directly. There are no leased rigs and no vendor liens embedded in the fleet. Decisions around uptime, expansion, and capital allocation stay simple because nothing lies between the company and its assets. Today, Datacentrex runs more than 3,100 Scrypt ASICs across four U.S. colocation sites. Power is delivered and consumed under continuous load. These facilities are operating now, and utilization is happening in real time. Growth builds from that base. Management has disclosed plans to expand the fleet beyond 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026, adding capacity inside facilities that are already running. Power, cooling, and operating processes are in place. Capital goes toward machines, not construction. The economics are already visible. Datacentrex has said its Scrypt subsidiary, dogehash technologies’ operations have been EBITDA positive from inception. Power costs are covered. Sites carry themselves. Expansion follows cash flow. The company is also carrying cash. Datacentrex has disclosed roughly $45 million on hand, no long-term debt, and full ownership of its operating equipment. It is not forced to raise capital to keep operating or to add capacity. The people involved have been through cycles where that distinction mattered. Members of the board and management have built and run crypto and data infrastructure businesses during periods when power tightened and capital disappeared. They have seen where leverage breaks things first. That experience shows up in how the business is run. Assets are owned outright. Capacity is added where operations already work. Liquidity stays intact. The company is not built to chase scale just to justify fixed costs. Management has been explicit about how it sees the model evolving. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) has pointed to companies such as IREN, Cipher Mining, and TeraWulf as examples of businesses where the market stopped valuing hash rate alone and started valuing who has secured access to power,, balance sheets, and operating flexibility. The asset is not the output. It is the infrastructure underneath it. For investors, execution here is straightforward. The system is operating, and cash is coming in, while capacity can be added without rebuilding the business. Capital, Revenue, and the Size of the Playing Field The scale of what is unfolding in data centers and AI infrastructure is already well defined. J.P. Morgan estimates that U.S. data center capacity could exceed 130 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 20–30 gigawatts today, with total infrastructure and hardware investment required to support that buildout running north of $3 trillion. Power, not demand, is the gating factor. Generation exists. Transmission, interconnection, and delivery do not move at the same speed. J.P. Morgan’s work shows where capacity already exists. U.S.-listed bitcoin miners are operating more than 8.5 gigawatts of energized power, with approvals in place for roughly another 8 gigawatts. These are not plans on paper. The sites are connected, permitted, and already drawing load. Moving from mining to higher value computing is expensive, but the most difficult step is already complete. Electricity is reaching the site. J.P. Morgan estimates that converting existing mining power capacity to HPC applications could cost roughly $10-15 million per megawatt before GPUs, with all-in AI data center costs exceeding $45 million per megawatt once hardware is included. That math explains why expansion across the sector is gravitating toward sites that already work, rather than projects that still need power. This is where Datacentrex fits in. The company is not trying to solve the power problem. It is operating after it. Its business decisions concern how to use existing capacity, not how to secure it. At this point in the cycle, outcomes hinge on where electricity is already being consumed. Other companies to keep a close eye on in the space: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVIDIA is the dominant global supplier of GPUs and accelerated computing platforms that underpin artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and modern data centers. Its data center segment has become the company’s primary growth engine, driven by demand for AI training and inference workloads from hyperscalers, sovereign cloud projects, and enterprise customers. NVIDIA’s strength lies not only in hardware, such as its H100 and upcoming Blackwell platforms, but also in its tightly integrated CUDA software ecosystem, networking solutions, and AI development tools. As power availability and infrastructure constraints become limiting factors for AI deployment, NVIDIA’s ability to deliver higher performance per watt further strengthens its competitive position across global data center buildouts. Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) Nebius Group is positioning itself as a next-generation AI infrastructure and cloud services provider, focused on large-scale GPU computing and AI-optimized data centers.

Title: Capitalism has failed to spread wealth and prosperity — and AI could do the same, says BlackRock CEO

Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism. More wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab. "In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain," he said. Fink warned that the pattern of unequal wealth distribution could repeat in the era of AI. "Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data, and owners of infrastructure," said Fink.

If AI does to white collar workers what globalisation did to blue collar workers, we need to confront that today, directly." He urged those gathered at the annual meeting in Davos to rethink how prosperity is defined and to create a "credible plan" for broad participation in the gains AI can deliver. "This is going to be the test. Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth instead of spectators watching it happen," said Fink. The world's wealthiest 10% own roughly 75% of global wealth, while the poorest half hold only about 2%, according to the World Inequality Report 2026, released in December 2025 and based on data compiled by 200 researchers. Fink acknowledged in his speech that the World Economic Forum has lost trust and "feels out of step with the moment." "Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone," Fink said, adding that the forum should be more transparent and precise about what economic success means, especially with those who don't feel represented at gatherings like Davos. "Prosperity just isn't the growth in the aggregate. It's not just GDP. It can't be measured by GDP or the market caps of companies. It has to be judged by many people who see it, who can touch it, can feel it, and can build their own future on it," said Fink. Fink has previously spoken about how the pandemic fueled a rethink of the US economy. In his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Fink said the growth of stakeholder capitalism — the idea that companies should prioritize interests beyond shareholders — was a natural evolution of how capitalism can best work to build a strong economy. "It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term," he said. BlackRock, which manages some $14 trillion in assets, has been one of the loudest voices in support of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, with Fink often highlighting climate change and sustainability in his annual letters.

Title: One Year of Wins: Trump's Top Accomplishments in First Year of 'Golden Age'
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/01/20/trumps-top-accomplishments-first-year-golden-age/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T11:00:06Z

President Donald Trump worked at warp speed to “Make America Great Again” in his first year back in office, and the results, on countless fronts, have been bountiful. Trump inherited from former President Joe Biden a country reeling from a wounded economy and porous border policies that led to mass illegal immigration and a globe facing destabilization with the advent of two major wars in the Middle East and Europe under his predecessor. On day one of his administration, January 20, 2025, Trump began to take sweeping action to address issues inherited from the Biden administration with 26 executive orders — a harbinger of the breakneck speed at which he would work to implement the MAGA agenda. In total, the Federal Register shows he signed 228 executive orders throughout the first full year of his second term — and that is without mentioning the transformative legislation he signed into law and highly successful foreign policy initiatives he embarked upon. “President Trump accomplished more in one year than many presidents did in eight. The President delivered on every major campaign promise — securing the border, stopping Biden’s inflation crisis, signing the largest middle-class tax cuts in history, ending woke DEI nonsense, and restoring American strength on the world stage,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Breitbart News on Monday. “Under President Trump’s leadership, America is safer, stronger, and more prosperous than ever before, and the best is yet to come.” Trump implemented his wildly successful tariff policies that produced many positive outcomes without spiking inflation, defying critics who claimed it would, began to heal the American economy, secured the southern border, settled or de-escalated numerous conflicts around the globe through his “peace through strength” foreign policy agenda, secured significant tax relief for Americans through his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, protected America’s youth and women from radical leftist trans ideology, and unleashed his and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. Trade Deals On “Liberation Day,” April 2, 2025, Trump instituted his worldwide tariff policy, giving the United States tremendous leverage to negotiate trade and pharmaceutical deals, broker peace deals, and drive monumental investment into the United States after policies of his predecessors led U.S.-based manufacturing to flee to foreign countries. In other words, Trump’s tariff strategy has driven many of his second-term accomplishments. Trump came out with forceful reciprocal tariffs, including a 20 percent duty on goods from the European Union (EU), a ten percent tariff on the United Kingdom, a 24 percent rate on Japanese goods, a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, and lofty duties on scores of other countries across the planet. The results on the trade deal front in the months that followed were profound, headlined by the historic deal he reached with the EU on July 27. During a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Trump Turnberry in Scotland, the leaders announced the contours of the deal, which include the EU’s commitment to purchase $750 billion in American energy and to invest $600 billion in America on top of existing investments. Moreover, the EU agreed to pay a 15 percent tariff on goods from Europe to gain access to American markets, and Trump noted that European countries were opening their markets to American goods. Von der Leyen stressed that the deal was about rebalancing the EU’s trade surplus with the United States when asked about the concessions the U.S. would make. “The starting point was an imbalance, a surplus on our side and a deficit on the U.S. side, and we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic, because the two biggest economies should have a good trade flow between us,” she said. “I think we hit exactly the point we wanted to find: Rebalance, but enable trade on both sides, which means good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, means prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, and that was important for us,” she added. Trump called the agreement “the biggest deal ever made.” In 2024 alone, the countries swapped €1.68 trillion, or roughly $1.8 trillion, in goods and services, accounting for nearly 30 percent of global trade and 43 percent of global gross domestic product. The EU deal marks the centerpiece of Trump’s trade progress as a result of tariffs, and followed deals with the United Kingdom, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The trade bloc of these countries alone accounted for 57 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of international trade. Trump has also struck new trade agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia, finalized during his October Southeast Asia trip. Most-Favored-Nations Deals Trump’s tariffs are paying dividends for Americans through the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) deals he has struck with leading pharmaceutical companies, which have drastically reduced drug prices. Trump told Breitbart News outside of Air Force One on August 3 — more than a month before he announced his first deal — that there would be “tremendous” drops in drug prices when asked if he had advice for Republicans ahead of midterm elections in 2026. “We’ll be dropping drug prices. It’ll start over the next two to three months, by 1,200, 1,300, and even 1,400 percent and 500 percent, but not just 50 percent or 25 percent, which normally would be a lot because the rest of the world pays much less for the identical drug,” he continued. “And we’re going to be paying the same thing. We’re going to have a Favored Nations. We will pay as low as the lowest nation in the world.” On September 30, he announced his first agreement with Pfizer, followed by deals with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi through the end of the year. Trump’s deals are bringing prices down dramatically on a plethora of drugs, and his agreements with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly provide prime examples. Novo Nordisk-produced Ozempic and Wegovy are dropping to $350 per month in the United States, down from $1,000 and $1,350, respectively, while Eli Lilly-made GLP-1 drug Zepbound is falling to $346 per month from $1,086. Trump is now calling on Congress to codify the MFN deals in the “Great Healthcare Plan.” He told Breitbart News on Friday that he gave countries an ultimatum: either agree to MFN prices for America or face tariffs. “We’re doing that by most-favored nations and other nations, whoever pays the lowest in the world, that’s what we’re going to pay. Right now, we’re paying sometimes ten times higher than other nations. So, we have favored nations, that’s been approved. Other nations have, for the most part, agreed to it, and they had no choice. Otherwise, we were going to put tariffs on them,” he said before taking off on Marine One en route to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend. Investments In large part thanks to Trump’s tariffs and deregulation, he has attracted massive investment into the United States from countries and companies around the world, including drug companies as part of MFN deals. Trump puts the number at $18 trillion in investment in just one year, while the White House lists $9.6 trillion in investments on its website, with some of the most consequential commitments being: “In four years of Biden, they secured less than $1 trillion of new investment in the United States … In less than one year, I have secured commitments for over $18 trillion from all over the world, the most ever for any country,” he told the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday. Leverage for Peace The president has also wielded tariffs to secure peace agreements. He described to Fox News in October how his strategy helped yield a ceasefire or de-escalation in most of the conflicts he has settled around the world: “I think we top everybody by a lot with the tariffs and all of that. But, you know, having the ability to deal with trade, having the ability to use tariffs to help me make a point — the tariffs have brought peace to the world. I’m telling you, they brought peace to the world. And not only here, but with so many other deals. You know, I’ve made seven peace deals where countries were in many cases, 30, 31 years, 135, 137 years they’ve been fighting and millions of people being killed. And I brought peace. And I did it through — in not all cases, but probably in at least five of the seven that we’ve done so far, it was through trade. That we’re not going to deal with people that fight. We’re not going to deal, and we’re going to put tariffs on you. We’re not going to let you deal in the United States. We’ll put tariffs on you.” “And without that, without the tariffs — I mean, far more than even the money that we’re taking in, which is trillions of dollars, essentially trillions of dollars,” he continued. “Far much — more importantly, it gives you a tremendous road to peace and the saving of millions of lives, just millions and millions of lives. You look at India and Pakistan. I said, ‘Well, we’re not going to do business with either of you if you don’t — if you don’t put it together.’ These are two nuclear nations that were — seven planes were shot down as you know, and they were really at it. They were going at it, and I said, ‘We’re not going to do any business with you. We’re not going to have anything to do with you. We’re going to put massive tariffs on you, both — in both cases.’ And they said, ‘Well, we got to start talking about this. This is tremendous amounts of money and power we’re dealing with.’” Trump added, “And within 24 hours, I had a peace deal. They made — they stopped. They stopped the fighting. And we can go one after another. You’ve been really nice enough to announce all of the deals, but there have been many deals. And a lot of them — a lot of the settlements were based on trade.” Speaking at the Ford facility in Dearborn, Michigan, last Tuesday, Trump touted that his “economic boom” is underway. The data from a full year in office backs it up. The Atlanta Fed projects the Trump economy grew at 5.3 percent GDP in the fourth quarter — an extremely robust number despite likely being hindered by the 43-day Democrat government shutdown in the fall. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett predicted in November that the Democrat shutdown was costing the United States $15 billion per week and would drop fourth-quarter GDP growth by one percent to 1.5 percent. Based on Hassett’s comments, the highly impressive fourth-quarter projection would presumably be even higher if there were no shutdown. This immense growth comes on the heels of a third quarter in which GDP “rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 4.3 percent annual rate,” as Breitbart News noted. The substantial GDP figures come as Trump has halted Biden-era inflation while overseeing rising wages for workers, giving Americans more buying power with their dollar. Over the last three months, core inflation registered at just 1.6 percent, the president said last week — a welcome reprieve after runaway inflation under Biden at levels unseen since the Jimmy Carter administration in the late 1970s. Per White House data, while Biden’s policies led to a 22 percent increase in car prices, a 37 percent rise in hotel rates, a 32 percent jump in airfare, and a 31 percent increase in gasoline prices, Trump, as of late December, had presided over price decreases across all such categories. Wages under Biden for the typical private-sector worker dwindled $2,919 on average, according to White House data. In contrast, wages climbed $1,048 for the typical private-sector worker in just 11 months under Trump. Blue-collar workers are seeing particularly significant boosts. Factory worker wages were up $1,300, construction worker wages climbed $1,826, and miners’ wages soared by $3,336 from January into December. “For the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation,” Trump said in a December address to the nation. The stock market has repeatedly hit all-time highs under the 47th president. White House data states the S&P reached 37 record highs in 2025, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke records 18 times. On New Year’s Day, Breitbart News Texas’s Bob Price and Randy Clark exclusively reported that “the Trump administration’s border team closed out [2025] with a historically low apprehension rate of less than 109,000 illegal aliens” for the year. The figure, which includes approximately 6,400 apprehensions along the southern border in December, underscores the effectiveness of the Trump administration’s border crackdown after policies of the Biden administration, including catch-and-release, allowed for historic illegal immigration. “Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 7th straight month of zero releases. Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes,” said Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement released in early December. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the dedication of DHS law enforcement, America’s borders are safer than ever before.” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Breitbart News Texas that in under one year, “President Trump has delivered some of the most historic and consequential achievements in presidential history — and this Administration is just getting started.” “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first,” McLaughlin added. “In record-time we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels, and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens.” Border crossings throughout 2025 dropped a staggering 93 percent, and 130,000 feet of temporary barriers were erected, according to the DHS, while the construction of the rest of Trump’s border wall is underway as commissioned through the One Big Beautiful Bill. The DHS removed over 622,000 illegal aliens in 2025 alone. The removals are in addition to 1.9 million illegal aliens who had self-deported as of December. Trump has settled or de-escalated eight conflicts or wars around the globe since returning to office, led by his historic Middle East peace deal to stop the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks. The president announced in a Truth Social post on October 8 that Hamas had agreed to his framework for a 20-point peace deal to end the war, including releasing all living and deceased hostages. Within days, the president jetted off to the Middle East to speak at the Knesset in Israel on October 13. Hamas released all 20 remaining living hostages on October 13. As of December 4, the remains of one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, had not been returned, according to the American Jewish Committee. Trump, along with Arab leaders in the region, participated in a “Peace in the Middle East” signing ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, hours after he spoke at the Knesset. “So together, let us continue in the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that has finally brought us to this incredible, historic breakthrough,” Trump said at a press conference with world leaders following the signing ceremony. “If we do, together we will reach the Middle East’s incredible destiny — a safe and prosperous and beautiful crossroads of culture and commerce, faith in humanity, and geographic center,” he added. “This will be the geographic center of the world.” On December 4, Trump signed another historic peace agreement, brokered by his administration, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, DC. The agreement marked the end of three decades of conflict between the two countries. “In this holy season we prepare to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace, we have come to the U.S. Institute of Peace, to sign a historic agreement that will end one of the longest-running conflicts anywhere in the world, with far more than ten million people killed,” Trump said. “Today, we commit to stopping decades of violence and bloodshed and to begin a new era of harmony and cooperation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,” he added. “I want to thank the two courageous leaders. They are courageous leaders.” These are just two of many conflicts or wars Trump helped end since returning to office. He has also quelled disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, India and Pakistan, Thailand and Cambodia, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Iran and Israel. A ceasefire to end “The 12 Day War” between Israel and Iran came days after the United States carried out operation “Midnight Hammer” to neutralize Iran’s nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. Trump and his administration also halted what could have been an escalation between Serbia and Kosovo, Turkish media reported. Trump’s foreign policy footprint continued to grow to start 2026, with operation “Absolute Resolve” on January 3, in which the United States captured former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, without a casualty of U.S. servicemembers or loss of any U.S. equipment. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years,” Trump said in a press conference after the operation. Trump’s efforts on the foreign policy front earned him the Inaugural FIFA Peace Prize in December during the World Cup draw at the Trump-Kennedy Center. Trump shared that the peace prize is “truly one of the great honors of my life,” and “beyond awards … we saved millions and millions of lives.” During his meeting with anti-socialist Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last week, Machado presented him with her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize “In Gratitude for [his] Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.” Another shining achievement of Trump’s — and hands down the biggest on the legislative front — was the passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To date, the bill serves as Trump’s legacy legislation, making permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts and implementing significant tax deductions for tipped and overtime workers, as promised in his 2024 campaign policy proposal. Waiters, bartenders, casino dealers, and other tipped workers can deduct up to $25,000 on their tipped income starting this tax season, while overtime workers can use up to a $12,500 deduction. The House Ways and Means Committee projects that Americans could get $191 billion in net new tax relief this year, with filers potentially seeing an additional $1,000 on their tax refunds coming this spring. “Millions of Americans will see the working families’ tax cuts put more money in their pockets when they file taxes this coming spring. In our tax relief bill, Republicans wasted no time and ensured that we cut taxes on income earned this year. Americans voted to have more money in their wallet, and that’s exactly what President Trump and Republicans delivered,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) said in November. “Tax refunds are a big deal for a lot of American families. It covers home repairs, health care, or summer vacations; all of which became completely unaffordable under Joe Biden. Thanks to the working families tax cuts, more Americans will have greater financial security and ability to provide for their future,” he added. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows a maximum annual tax deduction of $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles that were assembled in the United States, as long as the filer has a modified adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 or less than $200,000 for joint filers. Beyond tax cuts, the law delivers on border security by commissioning the completion of Trump’s border wall, funding mass deportation operations, and establishing the Trump investment accounts for America’s youth, with a $1,000 seed investment from the Treasury for U.S. citizens born from 2025 to 2028. Trump has taken substantial steps throughout his second term to protect women and children from radical left-wing transgender ideology. In February 2025, he signed an executive order to protect women’s sports from male participants. “With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over,” he said at the signing. As Breitbart News reported: The order contains several measures, the first of which is to re-write federal Title IX education rules to withhold federal funds from schools that allow transgender athletes to play as females. Another aspect of the order would charge the Department of Homeland Security with the task of denying visas to foreign trans athletes who want to enter the U.S. to compete among women. After signing the order, Trump cited the importance of female athletes and their role in the 2028 Olympics, which are scheduled for Los Angeles. He also mentioned the World Cup. “My administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes. We’re just not going to let it happen,” the president said. Several members of the Save Women’s Sports community, including former NCAA swimming champion Riley Gaines, witnessed the signing. Just over a week after he took office in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to ban “chemical or surgical mutilation” sex-change procedures for minors. “Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,” the order reads. The implementation of Trump and Kennedy’s MAHA agenda is well underway, with the latest moves including the new, inverted food pyramid and the return of whole and two percent milk to America’s schools. The White House unveiled reformed dietary guidelines for Americans on January 7 at a White House press briefing with Kennedy, Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Marty Makary, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. The guidelines promote a diet rich in protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy. “Today marks a decisive change in federal nutrition policy made possible by President Trump’s leadership and the work of MAHA moms and public health advocates who demanded reform,” Kennedy said. “These guidelines replace corporate-driven assumptions with common-sense goals and gold-standard scientific integrity. These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation’s food culture and make America healthy again,” he added. Makary said that “a corrupt food pyramid” had been pushed on Americans for decades, focusing on “demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak, and ignoring a giant blind spot: refined carbohydrates, added sugars, ultra-processed food.” He added that most children are consuming a diet including “ultra-processed food,” which he called an “epidemic.” “We have 40 percent of our kids now with a chronic disease. It is not their fault. This is something that is the result of bad advice from the government and a medical establishment that for decades peddled research from a flawed 1960s model,” Makary added. Days later, Trump signed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act to once again make whole and two percent milk available in America’s schools, after they were virtually banned by the Obama-era Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. In early December, Trump ordered a review of the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule in concert with peer nations such as Japan, Denmark, and Germany, which recommend fewer vaccines for children than the U.S. schedule. He directed aligning the U.S. schedule with peer nations if their schedules were deemed superior in the review. While the U.S. has recommended 18 vaccines for children, Denmark recommends ten, Japan 14, and Germany 15. As HHS noted on January 5: After consulting with health ministries of peer nations, considering the assessment’s findings, and reviewing the decision memo presented by National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, Acting Director O’Neill formally accepted the recommendations and directed the CDC to move forward with implementation. … The assessment reviewed 20 peer, developed nations and found that the U.S. is a global outlier among developed nations in both the number of diseases addressed in its routine childhood vaccination schedule and the total number of recommended doses but does not have higher vaccination rates than such countries. In fact, many peer nations that recommend fewer routine vaccines achieve strong child health outcomes and maintain high vaccination rates through public trust and education rather than mandates. For example, in 2024, the U.S. recommended more childhood vaccines than any peer nation, and more than twice as many doses as some European nations. The updated schedule “Recommends all vaccines for which there is consensus among peer nations.” Trump’s bounty of accomplishments does not end there. As Leavitt noted, he has rooted out Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies from the federal government, and according to Axios, was on track to oversee “the largest one-year drop in murders the nation has ever recorded” as of late December.

Jio BlackRock Asset Management, which launched its services in May, has built an investor base of 10 lakh, with nearly 18 per cent comprising first-time mutual fund investors, its MD and CEO Sid Swaminathan said on Tuesday. The joint venture between Jio Financial Services and BlackRock has also seen strong participation from investors beyond major metros, with 40 per cent of its retail investors coming from B-30 cities, significantly higher than the industry average of 28 per cent. B-30 cities in India refer to cities beyond the top 30. Speaking to reporters here, Swaminathan attributed this deeper market penetration to its technology-led approach and sustained focus on investor education. Jio BlackRock AMC manages assets worth over ₹13,700 crore, with equities accounting for around 30 per cent of the total assets under management, while the remaining 70 per cent is invested in fixed income and cash. Looking ahead, the company plans to focus on key strategic initiatives, including the launch of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and on offering international investment exposure through GIFT City. "We have recently received a no-objection certificate from Sebi to launch Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), and we are very excited about this opportunity," he said. The initiative will enable Indian investors to access global allocation opportunities in a responsible manner, while also allowing international investors to tap into differentiated investment opportunities in India. Alongside this, the company is exploring the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to ensure investors have access to a comprehensive set of core investment building blocks. The year could also see the rollout of a series of mutual fund offerings. The active funds will be powered by BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) platform, the same platform underpinning its maiden active equity offering, the JioBlackRock Flexicap Fund. The first of these new launches will be the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund, with its new fund offer (NFO) opening on January 27 and closing on February 9. As equity markets tend to move in cycles, impacting sectors differently, the fund is designed to dynamically rotate across sectors based on macroeconomic and market indicators, while actively managing risk amid evolving market conditions and emerging opportunities.

Crypto market crashes today: Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP prices are falling across the board as market capitalisation drops 3%. Bitcoin has slipped below $93,000, while Ethereum trades near $3,200 amid broad selling. XRP and other major tokens are also in the red. Data shows 95 of the top 100 coins declining. Bitcoin is losing its "digital gold" status to physical gold, which hit record highs of $4,725. Analysts warn that breaking the $90,000 support could trigger a deeper slide toward $75,000.

Title: Natural gas surged 17% yesterday and it’s triggering a macro trap that could suddenly tank Bitcoin prices

If the spike sticks, inflation expectations can reprice, real yields can jump, and Bitcoin’s liquidity tailwind can flip fast. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Natural gas prices surged 17.76% on Jan. 19, driven by cold forecasts across Northeast Asia and Europe, tightening liquidity in global LNG markets, and short-covering in European storage inventories sitting 15% points below the five-year average. For most crypto traders, a weather-driven commodity spike registers as irrelevant noise. Something for energy desks to manage, not Bitcoin portfolios. However, the transmission mechanism from energy shocks to Bitcoin runs through real interest rates and dollar liquidity conditions. When those channels activate, the impact can materialize faster than the market price. The question isn't whether a single-day natural gas move dictates Bitcoin's trajectory. It's whether the energy shock reprices inflation expectations, drags real yields higher, and tightens the dollar-denominated liquidity conditions that Bitcoin increasingly tracks as it integrates deeper into macro markets. The evidence suggests the infrastructure for that transmission exists, even if the magnitude and duration of today's move remain uncertain. Bitcoin’s 2026 price may turn on macro liquidity, SEC market access, ETF flows, stablecoin supply, and exchange rules. Track the chokepoint bosses, not influencers. Real yields, which are nominal Treasury yields minus inflation expectations, have emerged as one of the clearest macro drivers of Bitcoin performance. NYDIG research frames Bitcoin as a liquidity barometer with a strengthening inverse relationship to real interest rates. BlackRock has similarly highlighted real yields as a driver of crypto volatility, noting that higher real rates tend to create headwinds for digital assets by making yield-bearing alternatives more attractive and signaling tighter financial conditions. The mechanism linking natural gas to real yields runs through breakeven inflation rates, which the Federal Reserve defines as the difference between nominal 10-year Treasury yields and 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yields. When energy prices spike persistently, they can push market-based inflation expectations higher, lifting breakevens. If breakevens rise faster than nominal yields, real yields fall, a configuration that tends to support Bitcoin. If nominal yields rise faster, or if the Federal Reserve reprices its policy path amid inflation fears, real yields climb, working as a headwind for risk assets. IMF research documents that commodity price shocks, particularly oil, can move longer-term inflation breakevens. European research ties natural gas price shocks specifically to inflation and inflation expectations, given gas's systemic role in power generation and heating across the continent. The current move differs from typical US-only weather squeezes because it's globally coupled: Asian spot LNG prices hit six-week highs on colder forecasts, while European gas inventories are roughly 52% of capacity, versus a five-year average of 67%. That tightness creates the conditions for a sustained premium rather than a transient weather-driven blip. Bitcoin stability is under threat as a diverging "protein stress ratio" reveals hidden economic risks most experts are missing. Not every energy spike reprices macro. For the natural gas move to translate into real-yield pressure and dollar liquidity shifts, three gates need to open. First, the move must persist beyond the day, changing forward curves and expectations rather than reverting as weather models adjust. The Energy Information Administration expects Henry Hub prices to ease slightly in 2026 but rise sharply in 2027 as LNG export demand growth outpaces domestic supply growth. If the market begins pricing that structural dynamic now, the spike becomes more than positioning noise. Second, inflation expectations must move meaningfully. If 5-year and 10-year breakeven rates drift higher in response to sustained energy pressure, the Fed's policy calculus shifts. Rate cuts get priced out, front-end rates reprice, and real yields climb. This is a configuration Bitcoin tends to struggle against. Third, the dollar must strengthen. Energy-driven inflation scares often support the US dollar as markets anticipate tighter monetary policy or as global risk appetite fades. A stronger dollar typically correlates with tighter financial conditions, reducing the marginal flow of deployable capital into crypto markets. Stablecoin circulation, now exceeding $310 billion, functions as a practical proxy for crypto-native liquidity. Reuters reports USDT circulation at $187 billion, reflecting institutional adoption and scale. When macro conditions tighten, consisting of real yields rising and the dollar strengthening, stablecoin supply growth tends to slow or risk appetite fades, reducing the dry powder available for Bitcoin purchases. The linkage isn't mechanical, but it's observable: Bitcoin performance correlates with periods of stablecoin expansion and loosening dollar liquidity, and underperforms when those conditions reverse. The "rates up, Bitcoin down" era is over. Here is the exact dashboard you need to trade the fallout. The clearest path to Bitcoin resilience is for the weather squeeze to fade quickly. If cold forecasts moderate, LNG demand normalizes, and the natural gas spike retraces, breakevens and real yields remain stable. In that scenario, the macro bite never happens, as this was positioning and weather, not a structural energy premium. Bitcoin's narrative remains insulated from the energy shock, and the move becomes irrelevant beyond a brief correlation blip. The more complex scenario involves the energy premium sticking. Europe and Asia remain cold, low storage keeps LNG bids elevated, and US exports remain high to meet global demand. Breakevens drift upward in response, but the critical variable becomes whether breakevens rise faster than nominal yields or whether the Fed reprices its path more aggressively. If breakevens outpace nominals, real yields fall, a configuration that can support Bitcoin by signaling looser real financial conditions. If the Fed path tightens and nominal yields rise faster, real yields climb, creating a headwind. The worst-case scenario for Bitcoin involves a broader inflation scare. Breakevens jump sharply, front-end rates reprice hawkish as markets price out cuts or price in hikes, the dollar strengthens, and risk assets wobble. That configuration matches the “Bitcoin as liquidity barometer” framing precisely: Bitcoin tends to struggle when real rates rise, and dollar liquidity tightens, as those conditions reduce speculative capital flows and increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Bitcoin's sensitivity to real yields and dollar liquidity has intensified as institutional participation has grown and as crypto markets have become more tightly integrated with traditional macro flows. The stablecoin infrastructure that now channels hundreds of billions of dollars into crypto markets operates within dollar-denominated liquidity conditions, making crypto markets more reactive to Fed policy, real rates, and currency strength than during earlier cycles, when retail speculation dominated flows. Natural gas spiking 19% in a day doesn't guarantee Bitcoin will sell off, but it activates transmission channels that can reprice real yields and tighten liquidity. Whether those channels stay open depends on how long the energy premium persists, whether inflation expectations adjust, and how the Fed responds. For Bitcoin traders, the relevant question isn't whether natural gas matters in isolation, but whether the energy shock triggers the macro repricing that increasingly governs risk asset performance. The infrastructure for that transmission exists. The next few weeks will clarify whether it activates.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. European leaders eye U.S. Treasurys as Greenland leverage, risking a one-month yield shock on Americans. As 40-year yields skyrocket past 4%, the sudden evaporation of cheap yen is forcing a messy global reset. New buyers are accumulating below 6–12 month “top buyers,” so every bounce toward breakeven can become instant resistance.

Title: Wall Street's latest gold rush has found its new target: your retirement

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What do an employee at a dental imaging company, an English Premier League soccer player, and a saver with an account at BlackRock all have in common? They're all quietly connected to Wall Street's hottest investment class: private credit. The debt that most Americans have dealt with — from credit cards to mortgages — has been upfront: there are bills to pay, balances that are visible, and credit ratings that assess a borrower's creditworthiness. Private credit, or loans made to companies by private investor money gathered into a fund, is much less regulated and much more opaque. The exact terms of the loans, their price, and their ratings can be kept in the shadows and out of regulators' sight. Once a relative backwater in finance, private credit has grown into a $3 trillion industry that is increasingly intertwined with the economy. Small and midsize businesses are utilizing these loans to scale up, from manufacturing plants seeking to purchase new equipment to dental practices looking to expand. Meanwhile, private credit has become the hottest business for some of the finance industry's premier names, including Blackstone and Apollo. To proponents, like Apollo CEO Marc Rowan and Blue Owl co-CEO Marc Lipschultz, access to funding with less onerous requirements is helping American businesses thrive. To naysayers, including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and IMF Head Kristalina Georgieva, this explosion of less-transparent debt is unsustainable, and the dubious terms of many of these loans could lead to economic trouble. This fight has now reached a fever pitch as private credit prepares for a retail investor gold rush. There's already $80 billion in retail investor cash in private credit, but Deloitte projects that number will rise to $2.4 trillion by the start of the next decade, thanks to changing rules that will allow more everyday Americans to buy the assets. Depending on who you ask, putting private credit into regular Americans' retirement savings is the key to helping people achieve financial freedom or a recipe for disaster for the entire economy. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. At its most basic, private credit involves pooling money from investors to then lend to businesses. To facilitate this transaction, an investment firm launches a fund and goes around to people or groups with money — pension funds, ultrawealthy individuals, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments — and gives them a sense of what sort of loans they want to make. Once enough investors agree to pony up, the fund then goes out and finds businesses that need a loan. It could be for hiring employees, building a new factory, or acquiring a competitor. In an ideal world, the loan enables the company to expand operations and revenue and repay the loan plus interest, which ultimately benefits the private credit fund and its own investors as a profit. Companies like these loans because they can be more flexible than bank loans, come together much more quickly, and can be more personalized. Private credit firms and the investors in their funds prefer these loans because the returns are more lucrative than public bonds, with interest rates charged to borrowers 1.5 to 3% higher. The modern private credit industry dates back to Michael Milken and the junk bond boom of the 1980s, but it really took off in the wake of post-2008 financial crisis banking regulations. New laws such as Dodd-Frank prompted banks to move away from risky loans, allowing lenders that didn't operate as banks, including private credit funds, to fill the gap. The idea was that only sophisticated institutional investors or fabulously wealthy individuals who could afford to risk losses would have their money on the line. McKinsey researchers estimated that the industry grew tenfold from 2008 to 2023, while Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that the industry expanded from $2 trillion in 2020 to $3 trillion by the beginning of 2025. As private lending expands, there's an ever-increasing need for capital to fund it — and only so many billionaires and oil-rich nations to ask for money. Kevin Desai, PWC's US and Mexico head of deals, told me that competition for investor money is "at an all-time high." The next step, both regulatorily and logistically, is to open up the funds to private wealth advisors, who can provide access to the money held by America's well-to-do dentists, doctors, small business owners, and less flashy millionaires. And from there, the final step is to get these products out to anyone with a 401(k) or IRA. Why is a fairly esoteric and risky industry looking to the general public to fund its growth, especially since it will require tangling with a thicket of new regulations? To hear the private debt lenders tell it, the move is an evangelical calling. The industry claims that access to its outsize returns will bring wealth to the masses and even help alleviate concerns about the future of retirement. Rowan, Apollo's CEO, has said that countries like Australia, Israel, and Mexico that allow private assets in retirement accounts have had "40% to 50% better outcomes." But it's not so simple. For one, the push may not be as altruistic as the industry claims. Traditional sources of capital for private credit funds are already overallocated to the industry. And while some firms can rest on their laurels, the largest are now publicly traded, which means they face shareholder pressure to continue growing. That's why many private credit funds are willing to take the regulatory and legal risks to open themselves to the average American — the numbers are simply too juicy. The country has about $12 trillion invested in its 401(k)s, and Boston Consulting Group estimates that private wealth could have a $3 trillion stake by 2030. The main roadblock has never been the law — private assets can legally be part of a retirement fund — it's the risk of a lawsuit. American retirement laws give plaintiffs a range of ways they can sue the provider of their retirement plan for not acting as a "fiduciary" or legally-responsible steward of their clients' financial future. The higher fees associated with these private asset funds create a greater opportunity for future retirees to sue their retirement provider for charging excessive fees. After Trump's election, many of the industry's bosses made it clear that they were seeking "litigation relief" to fully move into 401(k) plans. This August, Trump issued an executive order to "democratize access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors" that supported the idea of making it harder to sue, and BlackRock CFO Martin Small told a conference in December that he expects to see real changes in the first quarter of 2026 from both regulatory agencies and Congress. "I have worked in this space my whole career in asset management, and I can tell you that we have seen more progress on this topic of private markets into 401(k) basically in the last year than we've seen in the last 20 years," Small said. For years, private asset funds — both on the equity and debt side — were thought of as the ultimate "smart money." But as the private debt industry eyes your retirement account, the cracks in this mythmaking are starting to show. At the core of the concerns about private debt is the very thing that makes them special — that they're private. The deal terms are opaque, and there's substantially less information about who is lending money to whom and the financial safety of those underlying businesses. Let's say you're lending to a pipe-manufacturing company that buys all of its materials from China. If this loan were public, the impact of tariffs would be immediately reflected in its value, with the price dropping substantially in the publicly traded bond market. But in private credit, the lack of real-time pricing could mean your seemingly high-performing portfolio is actually full of lemons, and you might not know that until you get a note that one of the loans in your portfolio is defaulting. Admittedly, the regular retirement investor isn't taking full advantage of the information available on their investments as it stands. The retirement process in America, whether the underlying asset is public or private, requires trusting that your employer will act as a good steward of your money. "You're hoping that your employer picks the right managers," Alex Blostein, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the large private equity and credit investors, says. The bigger concern is that the kinds of groups and industry watchdogs that do dig into these minutiae may also not have access to the information they need to properly assess risks. In the public markets, every bond offering or debt deal is closely scrutinized by huge rating agencies like Moody's and S&P, which assign publicly available grades. There are ratings in private credit deals, but not only are their ratings under the radar, but some private credit rating firms have attracted attention for the sheer number of ratings they produce per analyst. Egan Jones, which issued over 3,600 ratings on private debt deals in 2024, had only 20 analysts and a substantially higher analyst-to-rating ratio than its competitors. The eye-popping volume recently attracted the attention of the SEC, which is investigating its rating practices. Michael Dimler, a Senior Vice President of Private Corporate Credit at Morningstar, told me that when the firm reviews private credit deals, it receives the same confidential information that lenders do to generate its ratings, and there are "reliable channels of information" to keep investors in the know. In a recent paper, Morningstar DBRS explained how it uses the same policies, procedures, and methodologies for public and private credit ratings, and that the company receives information like "financial statements" and "credit agreements" to rate both public and private credit. This is particularly important for retail investors and everyday savers, as some market watchers worry that the industry will offload its worst private assets to unsophisticated retail investors. Their institutional investors and their own pocketbooks could reap a substantial payout by selling off bad assets at high prices, while retail investors will be left holding worthless assets. "A couple of bad actors could really spoil the party," Blostein says, noting that "some bad examples" could "create big reputational issues for the whole channel" even if most are "trying to do the best thing for their customers." Beyond the fundamental concerns with the private debt business, there are also growing worries that the asset class is not delivering the kind of mega-returns that justify the higher risks. As with credit ratings, actually comparing the public and private debt markets is harder than it sounds. While private credit has a strong case for outperforming its public market equivalents due to the higher interest rates, a recent study by business school academics at Johns Hopkins and UC Irvine argued that the industry's returns are "illusory" and that it fails to consistently beat the public markets. Industry executives and insiders have strongly disputed their findings, but it's a known problem that comparing the performance of different assets in the less standardized private credit market can be challenging. "The investors receive thousands of pages of PDFs, but it is very hard for them to aggregate and have an overview of what is going on and where the money goes," Oxford economist Ludovic Phallipou told the UK House of Lords last year. This presents "quite a mess," and he recommends more standardization of how information is presented. Just as owing money to someone else is a bit nerve-racking, so can relying on being paid back. This is especially true when questions about the borrower's financial stability begin to arise. Therein lies the real heartburn about private credit: What happens if the economy slows and a rash of these companies can't pay back their loans at once? Or a series of private credit funds come under stress? Goldman Sachs' Blostein tells me that private credit is unlikely to cause a market contagion. In layman's terms, you can't pull your money out of these funds whenever you feel like it, with "redemptions" usually restricted to 5% of the fund's total value per quarter. This prevents these funds from being forced to sell off their assets, which would drive down prices and cause a negative feedback loop. "The bank-run style contagion doesn't really exist here," Blostein says, explaining that it's hard to imagine funds blowing up the way, say, Silicon Valley Bank or Lehman Brothers did. Private crediteers also argue that the risk of the asset class causing issues for the financial system or the economy is overblown. For one thing, the industry is still less than a tenth of the size of the US corporate bond market, which is valued at $36 trillion. Advocates also point out that private credit funds are required to maintain a more protective cash reserve compared to the loans they make, compared to banks. While the big banks can lend out more than 10 times what they have in their coffers, the average leverage in private credit is around 1.4 times, said Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman. Responding to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's 2024 quote that "there could be hell to pay" if the private credit market starts to crack, Apollo CEO Rowan said that Dimon has it wrong. "Every dollar that moves out of the banking industry and into the investment marketplace makes the system safer and more resilient and less levered," Rowan said. But there are many other ways these funds are connected to the broader financial world. Institutional investors who provide the capital to launch private debt funds can actually borrow the money they put in, banking on high returns. Private credit funds can borrow money to make investments before investors are able to wire over their commitments or to help cash out investors earlier. These additional levels of leverage increase the potential blast zone for any private credit failures. And the source for many of these loans? Banks. So even if the mega-banks have exited the riskiest lending directly, they are still enmeshed with private investors. In a paper published earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston concluded that there is certainly risk of bank exposure to private credit, but that bank loans to the sector are largely secured and would be among the first to be repaid. This would blunt the broader financial impact of a failure in private credit, though the money would likely be lost in "severely adverse economic conditions." Michael Imerman, who co-authored the piece about private credit returns not being up to snuff, said he did "not want to cry wolf", but there's still a "non-zero" chance private credit could cause a crisis in ways that people aren't anticipating. After all, as a researcher who began studying big banks in 2007, he has seen "black swan" events before. "There's no way that all thousand loans or ten thousand loans will default at the same time. It's a consistent and reliable stream of income, let's add that to your retirement account," Immernam says, mimicking the pre-crash mentality. "What happened? They were wrong, all 10,000 loans defaulted at the same time, and retirement accounts took a giant hit." Beyond the possibility of a larger meltdown, some of the industry's biggest critics, such as Phalippou, are concerned about other issues in private credit, like stronger protections for investors. "I always thought it was quite an emergency, and now with retail in that space, I think it's a drama to not have strong investor protection," Phallipou told the UK Parliament. As for the companies being lent to, the biggest risk is that they may default. Already, some are taking on additional debt to pay off their initial loans or the interest, a process known as "extend and pretend." And if there's a wave of defaults, lenders are likely to become much more selective with who they lend to and increase what they charge to lend, making it even harder for companies to access debt without signing up for extremely unfavorable terms. "The only way to improve perception around all of these issues is more transparency," Blostein says. "And we would always argue for more clarity, more transparency, more data that will enable people to really think through all these issues." While the debate over broader risks rages on, private credit continues to grow. Even firms run by skeptics like JPMorgan are putting aside $50 billion to invest in private credit. And, soon enough, you will be part of the potential money supply. That could create a more stable private credit market, focused on consistent returns for retail customers and providing them with an opportunity to invest in the 87% of US companies with more than $100 million in revenue that are privately held. Or it could mean your retirement is going to be gambled on increasingly novel and risky credit structures that could come crashing down in the next crisis.

Macy's will close two fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, eliminating nearly 1,000 jobs by August 2026. The closures are part of a broader corporate strategy to streamline operations and centralize functions. The retailer has been a top-ten employer in Cheshire since 1986, marking a significant economic blow to the community. Local and state agencies are coordinating job fairs and transition resources for displaced workers. The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative.

The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. In a significant restructuring of its logistics network, the iconic American retailer Macyâs Inc. will shutter two major fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, resulting in the permanent elimination of nearly 1,000 jobs. The phased layoffs, set to begin in March and conclude by late August 2026, deliver a severe economic blow to a community where the department store chain has been a cornerstone employer for four decades. This decision underscores the persistent pressures on traditional retail as companies aggressively streamline supply chains to improve profitability in an era dominated by e-commerce and shifting consumer habits. The scope of the Cheshire closure According to official notices filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the closures will affect 993 employees at facilities on Knotter Drive and West Johnson Avenue. The job cuts will occur in waves, starting with night operations and talent acquisition personnel on March 14, 2026. Subsequent rounds will impact part-time and full-time weekend and day-shift workers through the spring and summer, with a final group, including maintenance staff, ending employment on Aug. 29, 2026. A small maintenance team will remain until spring 2027 to manage the decommissioning process. Macyâs stated it will offer severance, benefits information and the possibility of transfers to other locations for affected workers. A decades-long community anchor is removed The human and economic impact extends far beyond the corporate balance sheet. Town officials expressed profound disappointment, noting Macyâs has been one of Cheshireâs top ten employers since it opened the fulfillment center in 1986. The town is collaborating with the Northwest Regional Workforce Board and the Connecticut Department of Labor to organize a job fair and provide transition resources for the displaced workforce. The ripple effect is already felt by local businesses, such as nearby restaurants and shops that have relied on Macyâs employees as regular customers for generations. Part of a broader corporate contraction The Cheshire shutdown is not an isolated event. It follows an October 2025 announcement to close a Macyâs distribution center in South Windsor, Connecticut, affecting another 150 jobs, and plans to shutter a fulfillment center in Oklahoma. The company frames these moves as essential components of its âBold New Chapterâ strategy, aimed at modernizing its supply chain, centralizing specific operations like its off-price Backstage business in Columbus, Ohio, and achieving $235 million in cost savings this year. This retrenchment mirrors a longer-term trend for the retailer, which has periodically closed underperforming stores and fulfillment centers over the past decade to adapt to declining mall traffic and intense online competition. The evolution of retail logistics The consolidation of distribution networks reflects a pivotal moment in retail history. For decades, large department stores like Macyâs operated extensive networks of regional fulfillment and distribution centers to stock physical stores efficiently. The rise of e-commerce giants, led by Amazon, revolutionized consumer expectations for delivery speed, forcing traditional retailers to overhaul their logistics models. Many are now moving toward fewer, more automated fulfillment hubs designed for direct-to-consumer shipping, often at the expense of older facilities built for a different era of retail. This transition, while a business necessity, frequently results in workforce reductions in long-established communities. Key elements of the modern retail supply chain shift include: Centralization of operations into high-tech hubs. Increased automation to handle e-commerce volume. A strategic focus on markets with the highest customer density. The closure of redundant or inefficient legacy facilities. Navigating the transition As the layoffs proceed, the focus in Connecticut turns to mitigation. The coordinated response from local and state agencies highlights the critical role of public-private partnerships in addressing large-scale job displacement. The planned job fair and access to retraining programs will be vital for workers whose skills are specialized to warehouse and logistics operations. The outcome in Cheshire will serve as a case study for how regional economies can respond to the ongoing structural changes in the retail and logistics sectors. An enduring challenge for the modern economy The closure of Macyâs Cheshire fulfillment centers is more than a corporate restructuring note; it is a localized manifestation of the relentless evolution of American retail. While Macyâs strategic pivot may bolster its financial resilience in a competitive market, it leaves a profound void in a community that relied on it for stable employment. The event underscores the enduring tension between corporate efficiency and community stability, a challenge that will continue to define the landscape of work and commerce in towns across the country as the digital transformation of the economy marches forward.

Many are now moving toward fewer, more automated fulfillment hubs designed for direct-to-consumer shipping, often at the expense of older facilities built for a different era of retail. This transition, while a business necessity, frequently results in workforce reductions in long-established communities. Key elements of the modern retail supply chain shift include: Centralization of operations into high-tech hubs. Increased automation to handle e-commerce volume. A strategic focus on markets with the highest customer density. The closure of redundant or inefficient legacy facilities.

The coordinated response from local and state agencies highlights the critical role of public-private partnerships in addressing large-scale job displacement.

It follows an October 2025 announcement to close a Macyâs distribution center in South Windsor, Connecticut, affecting another 150 jobs, and plans to shutter a fulfillment center in Oklahoma. The company frames these moves as essential components of its âBold New Chapterâ strategy, aimed at modernizing its supply chain, centralizing specific operations like its off-price Backstage business in Columbus, Ohio, and achieving $235 million in cost savings this year. This retrenchment mirrors a longer-term trend for the retailer, which has periodically closed underperforming stores and fulfillment centers over the past decade to adapt to declining mall traffic and intense online competition.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Consolidation in a ‘Hunger Games scenario’ – and a true loss for the industry
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/ad-tech-briefing-consolidation-in-a-hunger-games-scenario-and-a-true-loss-for-the-industry/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → It’s January, and (as per…) the social feeds of most media practitioners are awash with predictions of how the industry will pan out in the coming calendar year. Many such missives are indistinguishable from the next, but among the platitudinous musings, last week’s 2026 outlook presentation from Arete Research stood out, complete with signature-style hot takes from the firm’s noted analysts Richard Kramer and Rocco Strauss. The Hunger Games First off, on a compliance note, the below does not constitute investment advice, with the whirlwind January 15 presentation exploring anomalies in the marketplace, all of which are likely to result in a Hunger Games-style scenario over the next 12 months, per the duo. All this takes place within the context of the media industry’s “Big Three” – Google, Meta, and Amazon – all of whom absorbed even more ad spend than earlier expected in 2025. “We are struggling to see from where in the economy we’re finding these incremental pools of spend,” observed Kramer, noting how this results in “Hunger Games competition.” Indeed, fellow presenter Strauss separately outlined his opinion on how the “Hunger Games scenario” will likely play out with media agencies, as holding companies “don’t have much more to give.” Of course, all this happens within the context of the AI arms race – Arete’s Kramer pointed out that the 2026 chapter of this era would see a move from “automation to action” in the rush to launch agentic offerings. He further observed the resulting “spaghetti junction of partnerships” in this rush, as demonstrated by last week’s tie-up between Apple and Google to power the latest version of Siri. “Distribution really wins in tech, and Google here seems to be in the poll position,” observed Kramer. “They have multiple billion-user properties of their own, they have captured end-point distribution with Apple… the Walled Gardens [continue to] play gatekeepers.” A ‘tale of woe’ & consolidation It won’t be news to Digiday readers that many independent ad tech companies listed on public markets had a difficult 2025, with this cohort’s talisman, The Trade Desk, seeing its stock price fall 70%. “It was a tale of woe,” observed Kramer, noting how of the near-dozen companies within this cohort, only Taboola and Zeta Global were in positive territory, with pretty much the entire category underperforming the S&P 500. It’s this downward pressure, including the need for ad tech companies to find new revenue streams and manage the risks of disruption as ad spend on the open web declines, that’s likely to lead to further consolidation within this cohort. Arete’s analyst duo noted that many developments in this sector of the ad industry will hinge on the outcome of Google’s antitrust cases. Of course, independent ad tech can’t bet its collective future on the defenestration of Google Ad Manager, as evidenced by the growth of Amazon’s demand-side platform – a dynamic likely contributing to the precipitous decline in the stock price of other DSPs – with Arete Research predicting consolidation to gather pace. “Many ad tech companies seem to be for sale right now, or looking to huddle together… this is going to accelerate in 2026,” observed Kramer, who later went on to note, “with the open web, shrinking the space for traditional SSP and DSP buying [ad space] at open web is a reducing market.” As to the potential nature of such exits? Strauss referenced speculation that Criteo may be up for sale, noting that entities such as OpenAI, PayPal, and Shopify are likely interested in assets as they seek to expand their revenue streams. Strauss again emphasized that such observations are not investment advice, although he pointed to Amazon as a blueprint for potential new market entrants. “It took Amazon a good four years to build that stuff, to hire the team, to build it, to have a proper data[set] and so on,” he added. The full presentation can be accessed via here. Elsewhere last week, the tragic death of OpenX CEO John Gentry emerged, with the breadth and depth of tributes to him serving as testament to the high regard in which he was held. Insights from the IPA Bellwether Q4 ’25: The EC further pushes to rein-in Google’s ad tech monopoly The European Commission published provisional findings on Google’s ad tech stack, ruling that its wares (primarily AdX and DoubleClick for Publishers) have been dominant for more than a decade, further recommending billions in financial penalties, with a forced divestiture also in prospect. ‘We don’t care if you don’t use our UX anymore’: Yahoo recasts its DSP as a data backbone for the agentic world Yahoo is intentionally making its demand-side platform (DSP) less sticky. “A big reason everyone wants agentic to happen is to make DSPs go away.” — One anonymous source opines on the subtext for the development of AdCP, etc. Ad tech’s Hunger Games are real… Advertising group Dentsu’s push to sell global unit close to collapse The Financial Times reports that private equity groups are turning their noses up at the international arm of the Japanese ad juggernaut. A Google VP explains why ads make sense in AI search but not Gemini — yet With Google’s Gemini surging in popularity, speculation has been bubbling in the ad industry that the app might be on the cusp of introducing ads to capitalize on the moment — and help offset the hefty AI infrastructure costs. Google’s Dany Taylor explains more to BI’s Lara O’Reilly. Google’s agentic commerce plan is here — what marketers must knowGoogle has provided a blueprint for major brands, writes Ad Age’s Asa Hiken, showing them how to connect to its AI commerce ecosystem that attempts to automate everything from shopping to pizza delivery. However, there are challenges for marketers navigating this complex landscape as Google builds its agentic framework parallel to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. McClatchy Media accuses Google in federal court of monopolizing online ad sales It’s that company again. We think you get the idea by now… Advertising is coming to ChatGPT, but not fast enough to outrun incumbent platform giants — one in particular. The European Commission is probing the industry’s response to Google’s proposed behavioral remedies. The joint venture is involved in multiple pitches for businesses with a strong U.S. base and international aspirations, while visiting pitch consultants to make sure it’s part of the consideration set.

Posted on 01/19/2026 1:35:46 PM PST by Mariner Tesla (TSLA) just delivered a rare double whammy to Nvidia (NVDA) over the past weekend.CEO Elon Musk revealed that Tesla’s much-talked-about AI5 self-driving chips are nearly complete, and that the next one, A16, is already underway.With the AI inference part covered, Musk said Sunday on X that Dojo 3 is being restarted, pushing Tesla back into large-scale AI training after previously pulling back. Nvidia threw the first punch, though, when it rolled out “Alpamayo” at CES 2026 (an open-source autonomous vehicle AI toolkit), aiming to become the default autonomy platform powering a ton of brands.

Netflix is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with traders anticipating a big swing in the streaming giant's stock following the results. Options pricing suggests traders expect Netflix (NFLX) stock could move up to 7% in either direction by the end of the week. At the high end, a move of that size from Friday's level at $88 would push the stock up to around $94, recovering some of its recent losses. At the low end, shares could slip below $82, their lowest level in over a year. Netflix shares are down nearly 30% since the company's last quarterly report in October, when an earnings miss due to a surprise tax expense sent the shares tumbling 10% the day after the results. The shares have also been pressured over the last month by worries about the streaming giant's pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has faced some pushback from politicians and rival bidder Paramount Skydance (PSKY). Netflix executives will likely receive a number of questions about the deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, including how the company plans to pay for the purchase amid reports that it is considering making its offer all-cash rather than a mix of cash and stock. Netflix is expected to report a nearly 17% jump in revenue to $11.97 billion, while earnings per share are expected to gain nearly 30% year-over-year to $0.55, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Goldman Sachs analysts told clients earlier this month that they expect the fourth-quarter report to "reflect a solid end to 2025 as management continues to execute well against its core areas of strategic focus," such as growing user engagement and scaling live sports and gaming offerings, along with Netflix's ad business. However, the analysts said investors' attention could be more focused on questions surrounding the Warner Bros. deal, including regulatory uncertainty, competition from Paramount, and how Netflix's business will operate until the deal potentially closes. Ahead of Tuesday's results, most Wall Street analysts are bullish on Netflix stock. Of the 10 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha, eight consider the stock a "buy," compared to two "hold" ratings. Their average price target of $135 would suggest over 50% upside from its recent level.

Title: California Billionaire Tax: Why Some Billionaires Are Planning Exits

ByNathan Goldman, Contributor. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act has sent shockwaves across the U.S. This act is generally defined by its proposed one-time tax of five percent on California residents’ net worth if they have over $1 billion of wealth. There are clear theoretical arguments to be made for the bill’s passage as it would raise an estimated $100 billion for health care and educational needs. However, recent analysis suggests that design choices and the current wording of the act could have devastating legal and economic consequences, including some billionaires being taxed well beyond the proposed 5% rate. What follows summarizes the current state of the proposed California billionaire tax, the recent criticism of the act and the design choices that may need to be reconsidered before it is potentially put up to a vote. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act was filed by Jim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health, and Suzanne Jimenez, who represents the SEIU-UHW health care union, in October of 2025. The act has since been put forth as formal legislation on Nov. 26, 2025, under the header of Initiative No. 25-0024. The act is currently collecting signatures to appear on the November 2026 election ballot. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act enacts a 5% tax on the wealth of California residents who have accumulated over $1 billion in wealth. The tax is unusual because it is a tax on wealth, rather than income, and the tax would include payments related to unrealized gains. According to Forbes, this act would raise $100 billion from California’s 200 or more billionaires between 2027 and 2031 (assuming no taxpayer migration or successful legal challenges), and these funds would go to replenishing funding for California’s Medicaid and childhood education program. According to the bill, taxpayers’ wealth will be defined by “personal property and wealth, including shares of capital stock, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness, and any legal or equitable interest therein.” Thus, the bill is taking the stance that all assets shall be considered when determining whether a taxpayer is a billionaire and subject to the wealth tax. The bill does allow a phase-in that will subject the taxpayer to the 5% tax fully once their wealth reaches $1.1 billion. Only a small amount of assets (up to $5 million) can be excluded from the taxpayer’s net worth when calculating their billionaire status and wealth tax liability owed. Even though the bill will not be voted on until November, the initiative proposes a retroactive effective date of Jan. 1, 2026, a feature likely to face legal challenge. As it is currently written, this retroactive application would subject California billionaires to the 5% wealth tax immediately. The proposal has already prompted significant responses among California billionaires. According to The New York Times, Peter Thiel and Larry Page have openly discussed leaving California due to this tax. Furthermore, Fox Business reports that real estate broker Julian Johnston is working directly with three billionaires about moving from California to South Florida due to this billionaire wealth tax. California already imposes the highest and most progressive income tax rate in the U.S., with a top marginal tax rate of 13.3% on income over $1 million. This billionaire wealth tax would represent an incremental tax on high-net-worth taxpayers in addition to the already high taxes that they pay, leading to possible perceived inequity over this tax. However, not all California billionaires are opposed to this plan. According to CNBC, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has said that the additional taxes owed (a reported $7.75 billion) is “perfectly fine” with him. While this news is promising, it needs to be taken with caution for two reasons. First, even if some California billionaires pay the wealth tax, if a significant number do not and challenge paying it, California may lose out on those tax revenues both for the wealth tax and in the future. Second, just because a billionaire says they will support this does not mean that they actually will. In fact, just 2½ years ago, Jeff Bezos supported Washington’s proposed billionaire tax. According to the Tax Foundation, he then announced a move to Miami, Florida, shortly before its passage, allowing him to forgo paying any wealth tax and upending the legislation’s potential. Potentially the biggest criticism of this legislation is not from the billionaires themselves, but, instead, from the state’s current governor, Gavin Newsom. According to the Los Angeles Times, Newsom strongly opposes this ballot measure, saying that it is badly drafted and will not end up aiding the essential state services it is geared toward. Given Newsom’s prominent role in both the state and the nationwide Democratic Party, his opposition likely carries a lot of weight among potential voters this November. In theory, funding health care and education needs by asking billionaires to contribute a small percentage of their wealth may seem like a popular and plausible path toward addressing a key problem in California. However, there have already been numerous issues raised with this plan. For instance, Baker Botts highlights issues like the Dormant Commerce Clause lead to a failure of the Complete Auto Test because worldwide assets would be subject to a California tax. This article also highlights numerous legal concerns associated with the retroactive nature of the legislation, the legislation being aimed at single out specific individuals (Bill of Attainder), the Uniformity Clause of the California Constitution, among other things. The Tax Foundation highlights that, as a function of design issues and potential drafting errors, the 5% wealth tax is actually much larger than that. In particular, a billionaire’s valuation is based on voting interests. The article uses Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, as an example. Xu owns 2.6% of the company but controls 57.6% of the vote. In this example, Xu has a $2.41 billion net worth based on his ownership in the company. However, as a consequence of the bill as currently written, Xu’s wealth tax consequence would be $4.17 billion, or 173% of his company ownership. The Tax Foundation highlights five other California billionaires whose tax liability would be well over the 5% being advertised, including David Baszucki (Roblox), Sergey Brin (Alphabet), Larry Page (Alphabet), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia). This raises questions about whether affected taxpayers would remain in California due to the unusually high wealth tax rate they would be facing. Other considerations raised by the article are that the levying of the tax might force billionaires to sell a large number of their shares (potentially tanking the stock price and causing other financial issues), the assessment rules for private businesses might result in them being overvalued, large penalties for understating liabilities, unusual language defining anti-tax avoidance measures, and a substantial tax that can be assigned to taxpayers that get married or divorced. While the proposed California billionaire tax is still far from a reality, both the potential benefits and consequences have become increasingly apparent. Should billionaires decide to depart California, they will still be liable for paying the wealth tax if the bill is passed. However, whether and under what circumstances this tax is challenged in court, upheld, and collected is a completely different story. Thus, California lawmakers and taxpayers must carefully balance the costs and benefits of attempting to levy such a tax on its 200 billionaires given the uncertainty in the outcomes.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept. Few are going to miss it. As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices. In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more. Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets. Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire. And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well. The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers. Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending. Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate. That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments. Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores. “This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.” He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030. Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size. Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity. From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta. For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.) But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more. Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy. As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely. In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior. At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached. These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.” Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!) Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.) With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

Title: ASML Stock Can Hit $1,500, According to Pro

Investing ASML holds a virtual monopoly in lithography machines essential for manufacturing advanced AI chips. ASML stock gained 80% over one year and now trades at 44.6 times forward earnings. Memory makers are expanding DRAM capacity aggressively to meet surging 2026 AI demand. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Michael Vi / iStock Editorial via Getty Images The semiconductor stocks have enjoyed another big leg higher to start the year. With unprecedented AI demand and aggressive AI data center builds pushing the fabs to ramp up on capacity expansions, it should be no surprise to see the broader basket of semiconductor names making up for lost time. With the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) surging more than 9% so far in 2026, it certainly feels like the AI trade is back on. And if you’ve rotated out of the names, the feeling of FOMO (fear of missing out) might nudge you to get back into some of the names you may have sold out of in the recent months of relative choppiness. With a memory chip shortage powering the data storage firms higher while the more cyclical semiconductor equipment makers get in on the boom, many may be wondering if it’s too late to act on the latest upswing in the hottest of semiconductor plays. Though the memory makers might be a tad overheated right here, I do see plenty of value in the more cyclical semiconductor equipment makers. Notably, shares of ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) look like a great catch-up trade for investors who want a massive beneficiary without having to pay as high a premium. Of course, the stock has already gone parabolic, gaining about 80% in just the past year. With 17% of the gains coming year to date, though, the shares are seemingly going vertical, as the photolithography machinery (it’s necessary for making the latest and greatest AI chips) orders come in hot. Undoubtedly, demand seems to be off the charts for AI chips, and that’s finding its way down to the equipment makers themselves. With a virtual monopoly over lithography machines, it’s the only game in town for a lot of fabs. And while the past-year run has been magnificent, many analysts see more upside for the firm as the wave of AI looks to lift it significantly higher. The stock might be hot, but it’s not nearly as hot as its peers. Shares are up just over 25% from their 2024 peak, which isn’t exactly bubbly, at least not in my view. In any case, a number of analysts see shares of ASML rising over $1,500 for the year ahead. As foundries look to expand capacity, I do not doubt that ASML could have the potential to surprise to the upside for its coming quarters. But given the steep ups and downs in the semi equipment makers, there is bound to be an upset at some point. I think we’re closer to the start of a boom than the end of one. But at 44.6 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), could investors be pricing in too much of the boom? It’s tough to tell, but the EUV machine makers are the place to be right now. And there’s potential for shares of ASML to lift off in a similar manner as the memory chip makers. Anywhere you look on Wall Street, it’s not too hard to find a bull on the Dutch semi equipment maker, especially as memory makers rush to invest to meet demand for DRAM, which nobody can seem to get enough of in 2026. All considered, I view ASML as a solid semiconductor pick and perhaps one of the more intriguing ones as the semiconductor scene experiences another massive growth spurt.

Title: Microsoft researchers have revealed the 40 jobs most exposed to AI—and even teachers make the list

As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, said Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in 2025. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The health care sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create among the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, told Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson said. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Welcome to your complete guide to all the Alexa and Alexa Plus commands you'll need for your life and home, from productivity to games. The newest Echo speakers are a great excuse to brush up on your Alexa commands. Amazon's Alexa voice assistant just had an epic year. Alexa Plus is finally out, offering AI-powered conversational features and advanced capabilities that go way beyond setting timers and playlists. But even if you're happy with your conventional Alexa voice commands, you may not know everything it's capable of, whether on an Echo speaker or your phone. From ordering an Uber to managing your calendar or movie watchlist, we're going over the top ways to use Alexa -- with a complete list of well over 200 options. And if you're worried about privacy, you should know our latest voice assistant survey found that Alexa is the most trusted voice assistant in the US, and you can change settings to help improve anonymity. Now let's get started with the newest commands we like. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include the following: Add in the latest third-party app connections supported specifically by Alexa Plus, and your capabilities greatly expand to some of our favorite interactions yet: Alexa Plus is going to get more of these in-depth interactions, too, with connections to Takrabit, Fandango, Grubhub and more coming soon. Before rolling out Alexa Plus, Amazon announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: America's new sink-or-swim era is here

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A few years ago, HR practitioner T. Tara Turk-Haynes hired yoga instructors and meditation gurus to help employees handle burnout at the media company where she worked. She's not doing anything like that today. Wellness perks are no longer "a thing," said Turk-Haynes, now an independent HR consultant in Los Angeles. "Attracting and retaining talent is not a business challenge right now." The white-collar workplace has gotten a lot less cuddly in the past few years, as the economic bargain between employers and employees has been redefined. Perks have vanished, in-office mandates are on the rise, and layoffs continue even as profits hold up — changes that reflect a system that prioritizes shareholder returns over stakeholder capitalism and corporate loyalty. With job openings thinning, wages struggling to keep pace with inflation, and AI looming as a threat to entire occupations, the recalibration is altering how advancement and compensation are determined inside companies — a new reality that some workers view as destabilizing, and others see as a long-overdue reset. "When COVID happened, there was a shift in power from employers to employees with the Great Resignation," said Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at workplace consulting firm Culture Partners in Sacramento, Calif. "The pendulum swung really far. Now it's swinging back." This story is part of Business Insider's series "The Future of Capitalism," which looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth. Earlier this month, Meta began rolling out a new employee evaluation program that ties career advancement and financial rewards to measurable impact, while Citi CEO Jane Fraser issued a memo saying she expects higher performance this year and to see "the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away."

In August, AT&T's John Stankey told managers the company had moved away from a tenure-based "employment deal" toward one "focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment." Meanwhile, some CEOs, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration, have become more outspoken about their political views, suggesting diminished concern about alienating talent. In November, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told analysts on an earnings call that his software company is the first "to be completely anti-woke." The shift toward a more explicitly capitalistic workplace is taking hold even as leaders across the political spectrum are championing increased government involvement in private enterprise. The US, for example, has recently taken equity stakes in about a dozen private companies—an unusual expansion of direct federal ownership in the private sector. Now, even though the economy is relatively healthy, most employers are planning to trim or maintain head count this year, survey data show, while white-collar workers are job-hugging and bracing for more layoffs. "There is pressure on CEOs from investors and shareholders to continue to grow," said Kriegel. "And that pressure is getting pushed down onto employees." The current moment stands apart, though it's not the first time the pendulum has shifted toward employers. The dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 also cooled hiring. Both events, however, coincided with steep stock market declines, whereas the post-pandemic period has been marked by generally strong results on Wall Street. "The stock market's doing well, record-setting, and yet companies are squeezing their employees," said Peter Cappelli, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. The rise of AI has also posed a new existential threat to workers. Many employers see the potential for the technology to replace human talent through automation, and some have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs. "Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI," wrote Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke in an April memo to the company's employees. To be sure, employers' labor costs — typically their largest expense — are on the rise. For one, the average price of employer-sponsored health insurance in the US is expected to increase 6.7% this year, up from 4.5% in 2024, according to consulting firm Mercer. Businesses have also incurred a new expense: AI investments, including chatbot licenses and employee training. Research firm IDC forecasts that US-based firms will spend roughly $320 billion on AI hardware, software, and services this year. Those costs come as corporate leaders are navigating what they describe as a shakier economic environment. Mentions of "economic uncertainty" on US public company earnings calls more than doubled in 2025 compared with the prior year, according to market-intelligence platform AlphaSense. Employment experts say the uncertainty helps explain why the job market has been stuck in a low-hire, low-fire state. Even as large companies such as Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Disney announced massive layoffs last year, the overall rate of layoffs and discharges stayed below historical norms, Labor Department data show. The result is a labor market full of contradictions, said Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter. "That's why it feels so weird," she said. The unemployment rate finished last year at 4.4%, near historic lows. Still, many professionals lack confidence in the job market as career opportunities in once-reliable sectors, such as technology and the federal government, have thinned. "Psychologically, it's damaging," said Lars Schmidt, a recruiting executive in the Washington, D.C., area. In industries where jobs were plentiful, workers generally knew how long it would take to find a new position if they craved change. Now, "most people don't have any safe prediction of what that may be," Schmidt said. Another drag on confidence is the bleak employment outlook. A recent survey of US CEOs by the Yale School of Management shows that nearly two-thirds plan to maintain or reduce head count in 2026. Further, average annual pay increases are forecast to remain flat in 2026, despite continued high inflation and after shrinking in recent years, according to Mercer. These factors may help explain why workers feel economically insecure. Nearly a third of Americans expect their finances to worsen this year, according to a December survey by Bankrate. That is the highest level of pessimism since 2018, when the personal-finance site began asking consumers about their financial outlook. Against that backdrop, workers are increasingly reluctant to quit. The US quit rate has fallen below pre-pandemic norms, federal data show, even as more employers mandate five days in the office and track workers' hours and AI usage. All of this leaves workers with little appetite for pushback, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management lecturer at Bentley University. "You're not going to see a big revolt," he said. "I don't think people have it in them right now." Though the overall job market forecast is gloomy, there are some bright spots for workers. Demand is robust for people who can build out AI applications across industries, said Aditya Challapally, who teaches a course for Stanford Online about generative AI. "This is a small, but rapidly growing niche," he said. AI fluency can help just about anyone get ahead in their career, added Challapally. Workers who understand AI are "able to move faster, make better decisions, and take on higher-leverage work," he said. Hiring is also strong in healthcare, social assistance, and leisure and hospitality, according to recent data from the US Labor Department. Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at job site Indeed, expects the overall labor market to improve as long as the economy continues to grow. "This low-hire, low-fire environment cannot last forever," she said. "At some point, companies will need to start hiring more." In the meantime, some workers are regaining a sense of control by taking on freelance or contract gigs that they could parley into full-time work should they get laid off. Others are starting their own businesses, tapping AI tools to get up and running quickly. Adopting a side hustle is safer than quitting a job and launching a search for a new one right now because the market is just so competitive, said John Ferguson, an HR consultant and former chief human resources officer at NASCAR. "If you don't have the next opportunity lined up, I encourage you to stay where you are," he said. "But also plan your exit strategy." Jump to

Title: Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicks off reelection campaign
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/19/teamsters-president-sean-obrien-kicks-off-reelection-campaign/
Time Published: 2026-01-19T10:10:56Z
Full Content:
Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicked off a 2026 reelection bid in Charlestown on Sunday — defending his record, speaking to the future and warning his opponent that Teamsters politics are a “full contact sport.” “We need a full court press going into Las Vegas in June,” said O’Brien to a lively packed crowd of supporters. “We’re going to send a message. Send a message that we are united, and we are ready to fight. And our opponents need to understand, it’s a full contact sport. They need to put the helmets on and buckle the chinstraps. It’s gonna be a long game.” O’Brien, who was elected general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for a five year term in 2022, is running for reelection along with Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. The incumbents face a challenge from Philadelphia-based head of Teamsters local 623 Richard Hooker Jr., and his “Fearless 2026” slate. Candidates need at least 5% of delegates at a Teamsters convention in June to advance to the November election. O’Brien held his kick-off rally at the Knights of Columbus in Charlestown at noon Sunday, cheered on by a hometown crowd. The president highlighted his accomplishments over his five years in office, including organizing over 90,000 new members — noting he hopes to hit 100,000 by the end of 2026 — securing financial stability for members on strike, making sure no contract can be implemented that members vote down and ensuring rank and file members a seat at bargaining tables. “There is no union that is doing what we’re doing,” O’Brien said. “We negotiated the largest settlement and the largest collective bargaining agreement in the entire country. When people didn’t think we could do it, we got a $30 million deal. We negotiated the strongest contracts in the food service, in the rubbish, in the airline, in every single every single division we represent.” O’Brien also came at Hooker directly, saying “if you listen to him, you think he’s running against Donald Trump, not Sean O’Brien.” Hooker has been a vocal critic of the relationship between Trump and O’Brien, who met privately with the president and spoke at the Republican national convention ahead of his election. “He has not discussed one platform of what he’s going to do to improve this union,” O’Brien said, accusing the challenger of only organizing two contracts. In response to the rally, the Hooker campaign contended the candidate has negotiated five contracts, with two being first time contracts, since being elected in 2020. “Our campaign has explicitly talked about member power and how plan on giving it to them,” the Hooker campaign said. … “One of the campaign platforms is to lower the per capita revenue the international union receives so local unions can survive. With so many layoffs and building closures happening in our ranks, local union will lose resources to fight against employers. Without the resources, local unions will have a difficult time to organize new workers.” O’Brien noted the goal is to make sure the opposition does not even advance to the November ballot. “Of course, why wouldn’t you want to run when the pensions are fixed, when the strike benefit at its highest, when membership continues to grow,” said O’Brien. “F—, that’s pretty easy, isn’t it, to walk in, but we’re not going to look back. We’re going to look forward.” The president spoke to continued “trials and tribulations” ahead of the union, calling Amazon the “largest white collar crime syndicate in the world.” “They’re represented in every single division we represent,” said O’Brien. “They’re our biggest threat. And by us getting the strongest contracts in each in all divisions, we are empowering the non-union to look at what we’re achieving.” The crowd was enthusiastically supportive of O’Brien and Zuckerman Sunday, packing into the event space and cheering loudly. O’Brien called the rally the largest attended union meeting in five years. “We’re going to keep going to every state, every city,” said O’Brien. “Make sure that we’re getting our message out there, make sure we’re talking to members, make sure they’re included and make sure we’re transparent about what our agenda is moving forward for the next five years, and just execute it.”

Title: Fortune 100 companies are back in the office — but 'work from home dark matter' is thriving under the radar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Remote work is far from dead — it's just learned to live in the shadows. Think of a big-name company, and there's a good chance it's rolled out a return-to-office mandate in the past couple of years. Amazon, AT&T, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Paramount Skydance have adopted a five-day-a-week office mandate, while Microsoft, Intel, and Starbucks have tightened their hybrid policies. As of the second quarter of 2025, a majority of Fortune 100 employees were subject to a full-time office mandate — up from just 5% two years prior — according to Placer.ai, a location intelligence and foot traffic data firm. Over the same period, the average number of required in-office days a week at these companies rose from 2.6 to 3.9, according to real estate consulting firm JLL. However, data reflecting how many US workers are actually in the office tells a different story, said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Bloom said actual work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years. He referred to it as "work-from-home dark matter" — a nod to the invisible material that makes up much of the universe. Like dark matter, remote work appears to be widespread, Bloom said, but may often be procured through special exceptions or flying under the radar.

"We keep hearing endless stories of companies pushing employees to return, but we just don't see much of this in the survey, swipe-card or cellphone tracking data," he said. For companies, the apparent disconnect between rising return-to-office mandates and actual office attendance raises questions about whether employees and managers are complying with RTO policies. For workers, it suggests there may be more opportunities to work from home than they realize.

Fill out this form or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Bloom's research, published on the WFH Research website he co-founded, shows that the share of work-from-home days in the US has held fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bureau of Labor Statistics data backs this up. Bloom pointed to a few potential explanations for why work-from-home rates have remained resilient. One is that while fully remote arrangements have declined sharply since the height of the pandemic, hybrid setups — with employees splitting time between home and the office — have been adopted by many employers. Additionally, Bloom hypothesized that some employees have secured exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. He believes many of these arrangements are "off the record" — granted by individual managers without formal company approval. Bloom said one reason some managers might allow these exceptions is that they're often evaluated based on their team's performance. If a manager is concerned that top employees will quit or become less productive under stricter in-office requirements, they may decide to offer more flexibility. "Managers are allowing employees extra days at home because they are high performers or hard to replace in their jobs," he said, adding, "Managers ultimately care about their team performance." One of these off-the-record exceptions was granted to a Wisconsin-based mother of three who works in a corporate role at a manufacturing company. When her employer announced a five-day-a-week in-office policy in 2023, she worried a two-hour round-trip commute would make it difficult to manage her childcare responsibilities. After an "off-the-record" conversation with her manager, she was told that as long as she came in a few days a week — especially for key in-person meetings — they wouldn't give her any trouble. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Not every work-from-home exception is off the record. After struggling to make it into the office following day care drop-off, Georg Loewen, a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency, said his manager formally exempted him — for the time being — from the company's three-day-a-week in-office policy. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said Loewen, who's in his 30s and lives in New Jersey. Loewen said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but that he has consistently felt supported. Bloom said he often hears about West Coast employees who are granted additional work-from-home flexibility because they have regular calls with colleagues in China or India that take place outside standard business hours. He also cited a case in which the head of a department at a Fortune 500 company was allowed to work remotely so his son, who had a health issue, could live near a specialist hospital. The survival of remote work isn't just about individual exceptions. While large employers have made headlines with return-to-office mandates, many smaller businesses and startups have quietly continued to offer flexibility. A report published last year by Flex Index, a platform that tracks flexible work policies, found that as of the third quarter of 2025, businesses with fewer than 500 employees were much more likely to offer flexible arrangements than Fortune 100 companies. And according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about half of US private-sector workers are employed at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Leslie Snipes is among the workers who have benefited from the flexibility of working at a small business. Snipes, a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency with around 15 employees, said her 60- to 90-minute commute through LA traffic quickly took a toll during her first few months on the job. After speaking with her manager, she received formal approval to work almost exclusively remotely. She said she typically goes into the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," said Snipes, who's in her 30s. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." In addition to the explanations mentioned above, lower office attendance may also reflect limited desk availability at some offices. Some employees, however, have simply ignored RTO policies without their managers' approval — a move made easier, in some cases, by geographically distributed teams. Others have turned to "coffee badging," the practice of swiping into the office, grabbing a coffee, and leaving shortly afterward to meet attendance requirements. If a weaker job market persists and companies increasingly use attendance-tracking tools, more workers may be compelled to return to the office. On the flipside, a rebound in the labor market could empower workers to push for greater flexibility. Amid this uncertainty, Bloom said he's confident in the long-term outlook of remote work. "Work from home is here to stay," he said. "But it's mostly hybrid, and it seems it's mostly off-record." Juliana Kaplan contributed to this story. Jump to

Title: What Do Costco Price Tag Codes Really Mean?

If you shop at Costco, you may notice that price tags sometimes look different. Some end in $.99 and others in $.97, for example. Then there's the "death star" asterisk that means low inventory and likely end of run. When you understand the numbers, dates, and symbols, it can help you shop better, save money, and get items not only before they're gone, but at the best price possible. Costco sometimes brings items in seasonally or to test them. Some stay stocked long term while others are only available for a limited time. At Costco, you can't always see something and decide to come back and buy it later. If you love something and it's a good deal, you may want to get it now before it's gone. Knowing the tricks of the trade will help you get the most out of your Costco membership. Many members follow deals posted in local Costco groups on sites like Facebook and by popular content creators. But understanding Costco pricing patterns puts you on another level. The superstore uses the same price codes in both the U.S. and Canada, so if you're from one country and shopping in the other, the same conventions ring true, too. Here's how to decipher Costco's price tag codes. The two numbers that represent cents at the end of a Costco item price have more meaning than you might think. If the price of an item ends in $.99, this means it's being offered at full price. It's still typically a great deal since you're buying in bulk, but it's the original price Costco offers on this item with no additional markdowns, unless you see additional instant savings. If an item is marked with $.97 at the end, this means it's a clearance item or the manager of that location has manually marked it down. This is usually specific to the location, so while you might see this price in your local Costco, a friend who lives in another city may not see it in theirs. It usually means the price isn't going to go any lower, so if it's something you have been eyeing, grab it now. Sometimes, this marking will appear in pen over a crossed-out original price, so it's easy to tell that it's a further markdown. With plenty of Costco electronics worth buying along with lots of other items for smart homeowners, you'll want to take advantage of these $.97 deals. You may occasionally notice product marked in $.00 or $.88. This could mean one of a few things. It could be that the store is running low on inventory for this item, and the manager is clearing out the remaining stock. It could also mean that it's a returned item, it may have damage, be open-box, or it's missing parts. It could also be a discounted floor model. Your best bet in this case is to ask a manager on duty for more specific details. Some items may end in a "9" but have another number before it, like "$12.89" or "$22.59." If you spot one of these, it usually means there is a promotional deal being offered directly from the manufacturer as a test for pricing adjustments and placement. This is typically done for limited sales periods. If it's something like coffee beans or toilet paper that you know you'll use and has a long shelf life, stocking up when you see these deals can save you a lot in the long run. The same goes for some of the best Costco electronics. But you may also want to wait for potential deeper discounts when Costco holds its own manager discounts. Along with different pricing conventions, you might notice symbols on price placards for all types of items, like DIY gadgets at Costco, which have meaning, too. Known as the "death star" for a product, when you see an asterisk, this means the item likely won't be restocked once the current inventory depletes. It's either discontinued, seasonal, or isn't selling well, and it probably won't be returning, at least not for a long time if at all. This could also designate a simple SKU or packaging change, so check with a manager to clarify so you don't miss out. Price signs often have dates underneath the cost as well. This informs the last time the price changed for that item. Based on this date, you can theorize about when the item might go down again in price, or if it seems like something that goes on seasonal sales, for example. Costco rotates deals so if the date is at least a few weeks ago, you might want to wait to see if the item goes on sale again. If there's no asterisk on the tag, this means there's plenty of stock, and chances are, it might drop even lower in price. One other detail to note about Costco price tags is that if it's green, the product is organic. Note that not everything that's organic at Costco will have the green price tag, so you should still read labels. But everything that has a green price tag is organic. Overall, look or the prices that end in $.97 for the best deals. Pricing that ends in $.88 or $.00 are good deals, too, that could be specific to your location. Manufacturer discounts that end in a $.X9 could be decent, but chances are if the item stays, you'll get a better deal down the road. That one's a toss-up judgement call you'll have to make. If you see an asterisk, get the item now, maybe even stock up with more than you need if it isn't perishable because it will likely be gone soon. Following these tips, you can save even more at Costco, won't miss out on the best deals and limited inventory items, and have plenty left over for the always $1.50 hot dog to satiate your hunger after a long shopping session.

Title: Legendary investor Rob Arnott outlines the 2-part strategy that's helped his personal stock portfolio double the S&P 500 over 8 months

Rob Arnott is revered in the investing world for his alternative passive index strategies, but when it comes to his own portfolio, the Research Affiliates founder likes to have a little fun playing the role of hedge-fund manager, too. In an interview on Thursday, Arnott detailed a leveraged long-short strategy that has allowed him to double the returns of the S&P 500 over the last eight months. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of his personal brokerage account showing this strategy having produced a 36.67% return since mid-May. The S&P 500 has returned about 14% in that time. The strategy comes from the idea behind the ETF Arnott launched in September: the RACWI US ETF (RAUS). The fund takes a fundamental approach to indexing, identifying companies with attractive qualities and valuations, and then weighting them by market capitalization. It essentially seeks to correct what Arnott sees as flaws in passive indexes like the S&P 500, which add stocks following periods of outperformance, only to dump them when they've underperformed. RAUS has a 95% overlap with the S&P 500. Seeking to capitalize on this concept outside the index, Arnott had the idea to take long positions on the stocks that his index includes which the S&P 500 does not, and take short positions on stocks that the S&P 500 includes but his index does not. He then amplified those positions with leverage. Every time William publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

"One really fun strategy, and I wish this had occurred to me back in '21, is what if we go long our non-overlap holdings, strip out the whole 95% that's overlapped, just go long our 5% non overlap and let's short the S&P's 5% non overlap," Arnott said, referencing when Research Affiliates launched its Cap-Weighted Index, on which RAUS is based. "Why stop there? Why not go 200% long and 200% short? I did that in my personal portfolio." Arnott could not share the names of individual stocks in his portfolio for compliance reasons. However, in September, he listed Palantir (PLTR), DoorDash (DASH), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as examples of S&P 500 stocks not in RAUS. Examining a list of RAUS's holdings, a few examples of stocks held in RAUS that are not in the S&P 500 include Xerox (XRX), Zoom Communications (ZM), and Rivian Motors (RIVN). "One of my colleagues likes to say, 'Suppose I come to you and I say I've got this great strategy: I'm going to buy stocks when they've just doubled and when they're trading at twice the market multiple, and I'm going to sell stocks when they've just fallen in half and are trading at half the market multiple. Why don't you invest with me?'" Arnott said. "Most people would listen to that and say that's stupid, but that's the way index funds trade." In September, Arnott illustrated this inefficiency in passive index funds with Dillard's Department Store, a repeat constituent of the Russell 1000 index. "In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times," Arnott said at the time. "So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading." "How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%," he continued. "In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000." Jump to

Title: I had 90 days to find a job after getting laid off while on a work visa. A $50 book helped me land my dream role.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aman Goyal, a 26-year-old associate product manager at T-Mobile. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I was laid off in September, just six months into my role as an AI product manager at an ad tech company. Because I'm from India and was on an F-1 optional practical training (OPT) visa, the layoff triggered an immediate 90-day deadline to either find a new job or leave the US. During my last job search in 2024, while finishing a master's degree in management information systems at Carnegie Mellon University, I submitted hundreds of applications before landing an offer. This time, the tech job market felt even tougher — marked by widespread layoffs, uncertainty around the Trump administration's proposed $100K H-1B salary rule, and intensifying competition for AI-related roles. Despite these challenges, I landed my dream role within 60 days as an agentic AI product manager at T-Mobile. These three things helped me get the job.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After learning I'd been laid off, I took a few days to process the news before diving into my job search. It was a big surprise, as I had recently received a positive performance review. With my visa deadline looming, I knew I couldn't afford to wait long before starting to look. I applied for roles at several top tech companies and a few startups, but the startups that responded weren't willing to sponsor visas. I came across three roles at T-Mobile and applied to all of them. A friend referred me for two of the roles, but I accidentally left his name off the third application. Interestingly, the only role I heard back from was the one I wasn't referred for. The job description was closely aligned with my past experience, and the lack of a referral didn't hurt me. I think referrals have become highly overrated, especially since it seems like almost everyone has one. My referral contact was helpful in another way, though. I asked if he knew who the hiring manager was for the role, and he shared the hiring manager's name. I used the email-finding tool Hunter.io, which offers a free plan with a monthly search limit, to look up the hiring manager's email and sent a short message expressing my interest in the role. I could've asked my referral contact for the hiring manager's email, but not everyone feels comfortable sharing someone else's contact information, so it's helpful to have tools that let you find it yourself. Fortunately, I found the right contact — and shortly after, the hiring manager connected me with the recruiter to schedule interviews. Business Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Landing an interview was only half the battle, and I knew I had to be fully prepared to make the most of the opportunity, so I spent about $50 on "Decode and Conquer," a product management interview preparation guide by Lewis Lin. By emailing the author with my receipt as proof of purchase, I gained access to a Slack community with more than 20,000 members, including aspiring product managers, current PMs, and professionals between jobs like myself. What I found most valuable about the community after I joined was how easily I could schedule mock interviews with other job seekers. Over about six weeks, I completed a few dozen mock interviews — some with senior or staff product managers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. A few of them were also hiring managers in their current roles, which made their feedback especially valuable. One of the most helpful parts of the mock interviews was that they helped me build confidence and develop the muscle memory to answer questions spontaneously. Doing practice interviews — and also many real-life interviews — also helped me realize that many people focus too much on what they say during interviews and not enough on how they say it. It's essential to pace yourself, keep the interviewer engaged, and be mindful of how you're coming across, especially since attention spans are often short nowadays. Some interviewers prefer concise answers, while others appreciate more detailed responses. You have to read their body language and adjust your responses accordingly. I also learned how important it is to really understand the question before answering — instead of just reciting a rehearsed response. The community also proved valuable for networking. Over about five weeks, I completed six interviews with T-Mobile that covered a range of topics, from product design to system thinking and agentic AI. I felt confident throughout the process. I received an offer in early November, about six weeks after being laid off, and started the role later that month. Today, I'm working on projects closely aligned with my background in AI, and I'm genuinely excited about the direction of my work. One of the biggest pieces of advice I give to the young job seekers I mentor is that even in a tough job market, networking can still work. It may not come through a traditional referral, but in my experience, finding a way to connect directly with the recruiter or hiring manager can be a game changer. Jump to

Title: What to Expect in Markets This Week: Trump Davos Speech, MLK Holiday,
PCE Inflation, Netflix, Intel Earnings

It's a short trading week due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, but there is still plenty happening. Stock and bond markets are closed for the holiday on Monday, the day the World Economic Forum begins in Davos, Switzerland. President Donald Trump is expected to speak on Wednesday in Davos, where he is expected to address housing market reforms and other economic topics. The delayed Personal Consumption Expenditures price index for October and November is scheduled for release, as is the final reading for third-quarter Gross Domestic Product. Netflix and Intel lead the tech firms on this week’s earnings calendar. United Airlines, Johnson & Johnson, Travelers Companies, GE Aerospace, and 3M are also reporting this week. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Housing affordability is expected to be a key topic for Trump during his Wednesday address in Davos. He has announced several housing market reform proposals, including banning large institutional investors from buying homes and instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase mortgage bonds to help lower borrowing costs. PCE inflation data for October and November will be released on Thursday as the Bureau of Economic Analysis continues to catch up on reports delayed by last year’s government shutdown. The Fed’s preferred measure of prices follows last week’s Consumer Price Index report showing that inflation continued to cool. Officials will be closely watching the inflation reading ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, with central bankers divided over whether to continue to lower interest rates. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Fed Governor Lisa Cook's challenge to Trump's efforts to fire her. Netflix’s report and commentary, set for Tuesday, could offer additional insight into the streaming giant’s efforts to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, which could be upgraded to an all-cash offer to match bids from rival Paramount Skydance. Netflix missed on its most recent quarterly earnings due to a tax hit in Brazil. Also reporting is Intel, the stock of which stock has been surging on optimism over its new AI PC chip and significant investments into the company from the U.S. government, Nvidia, and others. GE Aerospace, also slated to report, has seen its stock price near all-time highs after its most recent earnings showed strong demand for commercial and military aviation. Investors will be watching United Airlines’ report after rival Delta Air Lines reported a weaker-than-expected profit outlook, sending shares of airlines lower. Several Dow Jones Industrial Average components are also scheduled this week, including 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Travelers Companies.

Title: 5 Grocery Chain Produce Departments You Should Skip

We all know the importance of incorporating fresh produce into our diets, but getting high-quality fruits and vegetables from the grocery store has become a struggle for many people over the past few years. Across social media, shoppers complain about lower-quality produce and higher prices from both smaller regional grocery chains and big corporations alike. It would be reasonable to wonder whether U.S. quality standards have changed in recent years, as grocery chains seemingly show more red flags in the produce department, like mold, odors, and shriveled produce skin. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a grading system for fruits and vegetables to ensure quality produce distribution, but the grades vary by type, making it hard to know what you're really getting from a particular USDA grade. And while many stores and chains use the same distributors and vendors, self-described employees and store owners report that some stores are willing to pay for first pick at the produce, meaning that by the time produce gets to less expensive stores that are unwilling or unable to pay to play, the fruits and veggies have been picked over, leaving only lowest quality options available. Although issues such as old, bruised fruits that lack flavor and vegetables on the verge of expiring or rotting seem to be a problem just about everywhere, some stores are worse than others. The following five grocery store chains, in particular, have produce departments you should skip altogether. While you may not think of Walmart primarily as a grocery chain, gone are the days when the store focused on general retail merchandise. Today, the majority of Walmart stores in the U.S. are either large Supercenters, with a huge array of produce, groceries, and other merchandise, or Neighborhood Markets, which emphasize groceries and produce over other products. While smaller discount stores with a focus on general merchandise still exist, they make up only 352 of what the conglomerate calls its total 5,206 retail units. With such a focus on groceries and fresh food, you'd think that Walmart would be a great place for produce. According to customers, that's not the case. Sure, it may be less expensive than produce at other stores, or convenient to get everything in one trip, but entire Reddit threads are dedicated to the quality of Walmart's produce (or lack thereof). Redditors cite a multitude of possible causes, ranging from staffing issues in the produce department to Walmart opting to purchase lower-quality produce from its vendors. Produce delivery orders are not immune to issues, either. In one Facebook post about Walmart grocery deliveries, customers complained of rotten, moldy produce. One wrote, "...the other day all my peppers were mushy, my cucumbers had mold, my fruit [wasn't] close to ripe, and some overripe to the point of liquid..." Other customers agreed, suggesting folks avoid the store's grocery options altogether, delivery or otherwise. Much smaller than the nationwide Walmart mega-corporation, Ingles Markets is prevalent in much of the Southeastern United States, particularly in rural areas. The first store opened in Asheville, North Carolina, in 1963, and the chain's sole distribution center and warehouse is still located just outside Asheville, within 250 miles of each of its more than 200 stores across Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. While a single distribution center and a relatively small footprint might lead you to expect higher-quality fresh produce, its customers have found quite the opposite. Many customers in the Asheville area, where there are approximately 20 stores within 10 miles of the city, express frustration that Ingles is the most ubiquitous grocery store in the area, particularly given the low quality of items like produce it carries. On the r/Asheville subreddit, whole threads are dedicated to the chain's issues, with users noting, "The produce quality is absolutely awful," and that the store sells "fruits and vegetables that have visibly gone bad." Others share that although they have to shop there for many items due to the dearth of other stores, "definitely not for produce or anything else fresh." Perhaps the worst thing about the store's produce is that the price doesn't reflect the quality. One Reddit user summed it up concisely, "And for this, Ingles expects you to be okay with Whole Foods prices." If you can, go somewhere else. Like Walmart, Target has begun focusing on its grocery department in an attempt to become a one-stop shop for customers. Unfortunately, its produce in particular isn't worth the supposed convenience, with customers online complaining about spoiled fruit and vegetables. If you're looking for even more convenience by ordering your Target groceries through a third-party app like Shipt, just know that those shoppers don't have access to produce that's any better than what you'd find in the store. As one Shipt shopper shared on Reddit, "Target produce is always crappy." Other shoppers agreed, citing strawberries, apples, avocados, and salads as some of the worst offenders. According to a former Target employee, staffing in the produce department is the issue. They shared, "A lot of times the cold goods that just arrived [were] prioritized to stock and the pallets were massive, so the other duties like making sure all the produce was up to date and fresh and throwing out the expired goods could often be missed or rushed." Luckily, Target's return policy extends to fresh produce, as long as you have your receipt and didn't purchase it through a third-party delivery service like DoorDash or Uber Eats. Still, if you have to return the produce you bought as part of your convenience shopping trip, it isn't all that convenient. You might be better off grabbing your produce elsewhere in the first place. We know, this one stings. Aldi super fans may be hesitant or unwilling to admit it, but Reddit says that Aldi's produce is the worst. Not only does Aldi have a limited selection of produce compared to many chain grocery stores, but the fruits and veggies are often not in the best shape. While it's possible to get fresh, vibrant produce at Aldi, customers note it's very hit-or-miss. Some online share stories about moldy fruit (especially berries), citrus fruit that doesn't taste like anything, and vegetables that are mushy, smelly, and rotten. Even if you do manage to find good-looking produce, there's a decent chance it will spoil relatively quickly. Some customers have even shared stories of otherwise perfectly good produce spoiling overnight in the fridge. The problem, it seems, may be similar to the one facing Walmart. While the store sells its produce for cheaper than other stores, that comes with a different kind of cost for consumers. According to an alleged employee on r/Aldi, the store doesn't buy the highest-grade produce; otherwise, prices would be higher. They noted, however, "We throw produce (and meat) twice a day, so if you want the best quality, try going right at opening or between 12-2 p.m." Although ACME Markets is another small, regional chain with stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and its native Pennsylvania, it operates under the umbrella of Albertsons Companies, one of the biggest food companies in the United States, which also operates chains like Shaw's, Star Market, and Safeway. Customers' online opinions of the produce department range from calling it "unreliable" and "severely lacking" to "nasty," "horrible," and "overpriced." Given that ACME is also one of the most overpriced grocery chains in America, it just doesn't make sense to do your produce shopping there. In response to a Reddit post asking why anyone shops there, one person noted the close proximity of ACME Markets compared to other stores. They revealed, "The nearest supermarket is an Acme. The next nearest supermarket is an Acme. The next next nearest supermarket is an Acme." Given the ubiquity of the chain, some people don't even realize how bad the store's produce is until they move to another area with more variety. So we're telling you now, go somewhere else for your fresh fruits and veggies.

Title: The first year of Trump 2.0

-324.17 -108.85 -58.00 + 2,516.00 + 15,238.00 -324.17 -108.85 -108.85 -58.00 -58.00 + 2,516.00 As the world has its fingers crossed waiting for the verdict on tariffs from the US Supreme Court, the US President Donald Trump would complete his first year in office on Tuesday. It was an eventful year to put it mildly — the kind that puts twist-laden thrillers to shame. The Oval Office kept buzzing with one executive order after another — on tariffs, immigration, DOGE, oil drilling, brokering peace and big-bang investments in AI — that kept the entire world on edge. At this juncture, we take stock of how the US economy and markets performed in the first year of Trump 2.0 and look at how US equities are placed for the rest of his tenure. GDP Under Trump, the US economy got off to a rocky start with real GDP contracting by 0.6 per cent in Q1-2025. This is the first time the economy had contracted since declining 1 per cent in Q1-2022. However, in Q2 and Q3, the economy grew 3.8 per cent and 4.3 per cent. These figures are quarter on quarter, seasonally-adjusted annualised growth rates. In the US, personal consumption expenditure or PCE accounts for roughly 70 per cent of the GDP. Though PCE pulled its weight in Q2 and Q3, the real kicker came from a sharp decline in imports and good growth in exports, particularly services. Readers can recall that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs kicked in from April 2025. Trade balance While discussing tariffs, let us also address balance of payments (difference between exports and imports). Data is available for 2025 up to October. Trade deficit (goods and services) between January and October widened by $56 billion year on year or about 8 per cent. In the same period in 2024, trade deficit grew about 13 per cent. This is probably because the US didn’t import as much after reciprocal tariffs came into effect, while exports continued to grow (6.3 per cent). Focusing just on goods, between January and October, imports grew 6.7 per cent year on year and trade balance widened 8 per cent. As can be seen from the chart, imports were front-loaded during January-March and barely grew/ declined in the months after. Based on 2024 data, the European Union (19 per cent), Mexico (16 per cent), China (13 per cent) and Canada (13 per cent) made up 61 per cent of total import of goods and are the top exporters to the US. Imports from China were hit the most with a 26 per cent decline. Imports from the EU and Mexico grew 7 per cent and 6 per cent, while those from Canada declined 5 per cent. PMI Domestic manufacturing wasn’t robust either, going by the ISM PMI (Institute of Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index). Barring January and February, the index never crossed the 50-mark (see chart). A reading of over 50 indicates an expansion and vice-versa. This is a hit rate of 17 per cent (two out of 12 months) versus 86 per cent in Trump 1.0 (2020 has been excluded due to Covid). Inflation Now, onto whether tariffed imports caused higher inflation. Here, we are going with the PCE index, which the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets to keep under 2 per cent. Prices had risen 2.7 per cent in December 2024. Since then, the index marked a low of 2.3 per cent in April 2025. In the months that followed, the index has been steadily up, marking a rise of 2.8 per cent in September. This is the latest reading on the index. However, going with CPI, that index, too, marked a low of 2.3 per cent (in recent times) in April. Prices steadily rose in the months after, to 3 per cent in September, but have since cooled to 2.7 per cent in November and December. These could probably be the months when the Americans consumed imported goods that were tariffed at negotiated lower rates, considering shipping time. It doesn’t appear that tariffs have caused prices to shoot up dramatically. It remains to be seen whether the PCE index, too, will replicate this trajectory and sustain below 2 per cent. Jobs The year 2025 has been a tough one for job-seeking Americans, with ‘Big Tech’ and other corporate layoffs. Unemployment rate, at 4.1 per cent in December 2024, crept upward to 4.5 per cent in November 2025 – such a rate was last recorded only in October 2021. It improved marginally in December to 4.4 per cent. Going with non-farm payroll additions, 49,000 jobs per month, on an average, were added in 2025, compared with a mean of 141,000 in the eight years between 2017 and 2024 (Trump 1.0 + Joe Biden’s term). This period is considered as it nullifies the job losses during the pandemic and the hiring spree that followed. June, August, October even saw a month-on-month decline in payroll. This is a phenomenon last observed only in December 2020. Macros in short: Consumption has done okay, although it needs to be noted that this is driven by a K-shaped economy. Imports have declined, jobs are in poor state and prices are uncertain to decline sustainably. S&P 500 in the first year of Presidents Before we move on to markets, here’s a fun stat. We compared how S&P 500 performed in the first year of Presidents — over 50 years, in the last 14 terms, starting from when Gerald Ford took over after Richard Nixon resigned (see Table 1). Trump 2.0 (2025) falls in the bottom half at the eighth position, with 2017 under Trump 1.0 the third best. With the mean of the sample at 11 per cent, 2025 is still above average. How asset classes fared US equities have given good returns. S&P 500, Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite have delivered 16 per cent, 14 per cent and 20 per cent, since January 20, 2025 (inauguration day) till date. While S&P 500 returned 16 per cent, its EPS grew just 12.5 per cent. Sector-wise performance of S&P 500 constituents has been given in Table 3. All sectors posted earnings growth, except for energy, while heavy-weight IT’s profit grew 26 per cent. The market cap of the Mag7 stocks expanded 20 per cent in aggregate, with their earnings growing 26 per cent (comparing 2024 earnings with estimated earnings for 2025, which is the sum of actual earnings up to Q3 2025 and consensus estimates for Q4 2025). Stocks excluding the Mag7 (S&P 493) have delivered 14 per cent returns for a 11 per cent rise in earnings. Within the Mag7, except Alphabet and Nvidia, the rest delivered modest returns between 1 per cent and 9 per cent. Alphabet and Nvidia returned 65 per cent and 34 per cent. Globally, equity indices have fared better than their US counterparts. Korean KOSPI and the Japanese Nikkei 225 indices stand out with returns of 92 per cent and 40 per cent, while Hong Kong-based Hang Seng rose 37 per cent. Indices in Europe — DAX, FTSE 100 and Euro Stoxx 50 delivered between 17 per cent and 20 per cent. This trend can also be observed in how currencies have moved in the comparable period. The dollar index (DXY) recorded one of its worst years in history (9th worst), falling 9.3 per cent. The Euro, GBP and Yuan gained 13 per cent, 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, while DXY fell 9 per cent. Tariffs-caused volatility, a falling dollar against the backdrop of a 20+ per cent correction in crude prices partly meant indices in Europe and China fared better. The falling dollar is also one reason why gold and silver gave stellar returns ($ terms) of 70 per cent and 197 per cent. On to the debt market now. Debt ETFs gave good returns. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs are presented in the table as representatives. Trump came to power when bond yields had spiked from the lows of September 2024, after the Fed started cutting rates, on fears that the rate cuts were premature. Through 2025, although yields have cooled, they have remained high and stubbornly above 4 per cent. What is noteworthy is that yields at the longer end of the curve have held up more (see chart). This could well be because of the lack of clarity as to whether inflation can be tamed and sustained under the Fed’s target range. If anyone was as excited about striking ‘deals’ after Trump, it should be the ‘tech bros’ of Silicon Valley, with their big-bang AI deals, often among themselves. The $500-billion Stargate project where OpenAI and Oracle are parties, Nvidia’s planned $100-billion investment in Open AI and the US government’s purchase of a 10-per cent stake in Intel for over $10 billion come to mind. The year also saw AI start-ups such as Anthropic, Perplexity and OpenAI raise millions of dollars at exorbitant valuations. With the economic use-cases for AI still only evolving, it appears as if the line between optimism and delusion have blurred on Wall Street. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and Meta are estimated to invest about $1.1 trillion in capex over 2025 and 2026. Applying a fixed asset turnover ratio of 2x implies an expected incremental revenue of $2.2 trillion which is 1.3x the current revenue of these five giants ($1.6 trillion) - such a revenue growth is highly unlikely To be fair, market did get jittery about AI stocks late in the year. However, even after steep corrections, stocks such as Oracle have still given good returns over the year and are yet valued at a premium to their five-year mean earnings multiples (see Table 4). For some, current valuations are baking in very high earnings growth expectations, anywhere between 50-130 per cent, over the next 12 months. For Mag7 stocks such as Alphabet and Meta, the cash cow of ad revenue has to fire to support capital investments in AI – and such revenue is tied to sustainability of strong consumption, especially on a high base. The combined market cap of top AI stocks is now over 42 per cent of S&P 500’s full market cap, and the combined earnings are over 30 per cent of the combined earnings of all S&P 500 stocks. Clearly, a lot is riding on the AI wave. In 2026, either AI clicks or the stocks fold. The past year has been a strange one where all asset classes performed well — equities, real assets and debt. Such scenarios don’t last long, and the near future could prove investors in one or more asset classes wrong. For now, that asset class could be US equities. The S&P 500 trades at a P/E ratio of 28x, building in an estimated earnings growth of 16 per cent over the next 12 months. As can be seen from the chart, the index is now trading at valuations above sub-prime peak levels and at similar multiples as the dotcom bubble. While robust AI-led earnings growth is not a given at this stage, rerating in equities can be even challenging – with yields at the longer end not giving in. While the bullish views on the AI trade and consequently the US markets is now well known, it would be worth taking note of an interesting point brought out by long-term fund manager Dr John Hussman. He was prescient in his bearish calls, just ahead of the peak of the dotcom bubble and the 2007 housing bubble. While his bearish views over the last few years have not played out, he makes an interesting point for investors to ponder. He points out that corporate profits (surplus) have reached record levels and this has been made possible by the deficit/ debt of the other two sectors – namely, households and government. While household and government debt has grown to exorbitant levels, equities’ valuations are still factoring in record surpluses of corporates to sustain, ignoring events such as credit defaults. If such events unfold, equity bulls could be caught napping. Recent tremors in the US private credit market must not be ignored. In other words, sustained good returns in US equities would require continued increase in government deficit. His view: Even taking the sectoral deficit/surplus structure as durable, I expect we’ll see market losses, both in the S&P 500 and in the technology sector, on the order of -50 per cent to -70 per cent over the completion of this cycle. While Trump takes pride in record stock market levels, the real test will be in 2026, as brewing affordability crisis undermines macro-economic numbers, cracks emerge on the AI trade, tariff impacts deepen, showdown with the Fed heats up and geopolitics is at its toughest in decades. All this must be offset by an AI miracle to justify the current S&P 500 valuation. Published on January 17, 2026 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories like Apple losing to Google, and Meta giving up on VR

Here's your firmware update for January 16, 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week, Meta turned its back on VR, and Apple caved to Google in its hunt for an AI update for Siri. To catch up on these and the other seven biggest tech news stories of the week, scroll down to see our recaps of the big things that happened. When you're done, check out the seven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend. It hasn’t been a great time for drone fans in the US, with the FCC recently banning the sale of new, foreign-made drones – and a separate proposal from the US Department of Commerce taking aim at all Chinese drone imports (including existing models that have already been launched). Well, fortunately, a U-turn from the latter has removed that particular restriction from the equation for now. That means that stock of previously approved drones like the DJI Mavic 3 Pro and the Antigravity A1 can still be legally imported into the US. Still, with the FCC effectively banning the sale of foreign-made drones that it hasn’t approved (in other words, all new models), the future still looks bleak for Stateside drone fans. We got our first look at Sophie Turner as filming on Amazon’s Tomb Raider TV show begins, and the recreation of the character’s iconic video game look is perfect, highlighting to fans of the games how seriously Amazon is taking this adaptation. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Obviously, this is just a still of Turner in her costume, but she is undeniably Lara Croft in it, and if similar care and attention has been paid to the rest of the cast (which includes Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver, and Martin Bobb-Semple, among others) as well as the show’s story, we could be in for a real treat. No release date has been given yet, but we can’t rule out a mid- to late 2026 launch. Over the past few weeks, Spotify Premium subscribers have been encountering AI-generated music recommendations in their Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists, prompting the music platform to introduce labels to identify AI-generated music in a monster Reddit thread. According to users who have experienced this, the issue with AI music on Spotify is only getting worse; the problem doesn’t lie with AI music itself, but with the deception on Spotify’s part, which is what’s getting under people’s skin. This has led many paying users to think it’s part of a wider, secret business plan and that Spotify is deliberately doing this to avoid paying artists further. In other news, Spotify has also raised subscription prices for US members, affecting all tiers. It marks the third price increase since 2023, which many people are attributing to the maintenance of Spotify Lossless. This week, Meta seemed to give up on VR as it slashed Reality Labs jobs, including closing down several VR game studios, and ending updates for the excellent VR fitness platform Supernatural. The news is a tragedy for fans of the Meta Quest system as it suggests Meta’s future support for its headsets will be at least a little lackluster, and Hamish Hector argued that, as things stand, he’s only interested in the Steam Frame. It’s no secret Reality Labs has been hemorrhaging funds for some time, but this major about-turn from Meta might lead some to wonder if you can trust the company not to change course again if its new AI glasses focus starts to go awry. Google has just dropped "Personal Intelligence" for Gemini, and it might be the most significant leap for AI assistants yet. This upgrade allows Gemini to securely tap into your personal Google ecosystem (Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube) to provide deep, individualized context for your queries. The capabilities are genuinely impressive: imagine Gemini diagnosing a car issue by checking your Gmail purchase history for the model, scanning your Photos for service records, and pulling DIY solutions from YouTube. It’s the "true" AI assistant we’ve been waiting for. Interestingly, given the newly announced Apple-Google AI partnership, this looks like a sneak peek at how the next-gen Siri might function in iOS 27. Apple got served a huge slice of humble pie this week, as it conceded Ai supremacy to Google announcing that Siri’ s next-gen version will be backed by Gemini. A lot of questions remain, but in a joint statement Apple and Google revealed “These [Gemini] models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.”Apple first unveiled its plans to launch an AI-upgraded Siri during WWDC 2024 but almost two years later we’re still waiting for the upgrade. The company has since promised a Spring 2026 launch, and with Google Gemini it might finally make that happen. Well, we have officially had the first major outage of 2026, and it was a massive, nearly 8-hour outage that took out Verizon's cell service for customers across the United States on January 14, 2026. You can see our full reporting in the live blog linked below, but it was a serious, hours-long event that saw folks with Verizon swap 5G and network bars for SOS with no access to voice, text, and data across much of the country. Down Detector reports swelled around 12:30 PM ET, with Verizon confirming the issue at 1 PM, but many folks did not see any signs of recovery until closer to 8 PM ET that evening. The carrier didn't have the best communication during the event, with only a few statements that came hours apart. The day after the outage, Verizon confirmed each account would receive a single $20 credit, which, simply put, many customers were not pleased with. The carrier also confirmed to TechRadar that it was a software issue tied to a cyber incident.

Longtime entrepreneur and critic Anil Dash on where the tech industry has been and where it may be going 2:00 PM PST on January 14, 2026 Tech entrepreneur and writer Anil Dash. Photo: Anil Dash Advertisement opens in a new tab. These are tough times for tech workers. Half-a-million tech workers lost their jobs in 2025 as their companies continued to invest, insatiably, in AI and deploy products that have caused psychosis in their own investors, seamlessly produced and proliferated child sex abuse material, and encouraged teenagers to kill themselves. So-called “hard tech” is in: Jobs in defense and surveillance are the hottest roles on the market. Working 9-9-6 (that’s 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week) is the new answer to work-life balance. And for anyone still holding onto the progressive, pro-immigrant, “democratizing” dreams of the tech industry of the 2010s, Big Tech leaders (and some of their partners, including a distracting Lauren Sánchez) made their new political alignment clear as day just under a year ago, when they joined Donald Trump at his second inauguration. Anil Dash is not surprised by the dark turn the industry has taken. As a seasoned entrepreneur, prolific early blogger, and proponent for civil liberties in the digital world (he sits on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), Dash has kept a close eye on tech leaders and chronicled the impacts on the workforce in his blog, including a recent post with the howling headline How the hell are you supposed to have a career in tech in 2026?. To usher our tech-minded (and anti-tech-minded) readers into 2026, Gazetteer SF got Dash on the phone for a chat about AI, labor, why the MAGA ethos has taken hold of the industry, and a grand VC conspiracy. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You said this moment in tech is “grim” and “about as bad as you’ve seen.” What are the forces that have brought us to this moment? A great one, that is going somewhat underreported, is just the numbers. ChatGPT came out in late 2022, a little over three years ago, and since then there have been over half-a-million layoffs across the tech sector. Just that one signal — put all the other things aside — that’s decimation. That’s twice as much as the DOGE guys cut in the federal government. This would be devastating if it was the auto industry. It’s ten times as many people as work in the entirety of coal mining. It’s shocking to think about that many jobs gone. This industry’s been gutted. In any normal time, people would say, “Oh, this is a recession.” But because those same companies [who are doing layoffs] are doing this financial sleight-of-hand where they’re doing deals with each other — like, “We’ll buy machines from you and you buy AI from us,” — they make it look like the share prices are going up, so it doesn’t look like a recession. That’s part one. Part two is what we’re seeing at the top, which trickles down to tech workers and creates this really grim outlook. What I mean is we’re seeing this new technique of the leaders of these companies — the investors, owners, CEOs — are now able to make money even if the companies never make money. That’s new. It started a little over ten years ago, and I’ll give you Uber as an example. Before they went public, Uber had only ever lost money. Billions and billions of dollars. And yet, their investors were still able to make billions of billions of dollars in profit by making this thing public and recouping that money on IPO day. That is different than everything else in the prior history of the industry. What they figured out was if you tell a great story, and, importantly, if you get a legal monopoly, which Uber and Lyft basically did, you can print money kind of without regard to whether it ever makes sense as a business or not. So that’s been a pattern with everything that’s followed, whether it’s crypto or AI. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that's not venture capital. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that’s not venture capital. If you wouldn’t call this venture capitalism, what would you call it? It’s pure crony capitalism. Corruption capitalism. These days, when you go to raise, the VCs are explicit about how they’re all talking to each other about what your business is, what your economics are, what they think of your company, what they each think they might offer you. That is collusion. They’re not competitors. It is essentially one company with different divisions, openly sharing information against entrepreneurs. If you get to even a Series B, you will have to take money from either Andreessen Horowitz or Founders Fund or Ron Conway, and it’s straight-up Godfather shit. They’ll say, “You’re gonna need help some day, and we can help you. We know PR. If you get stuck, we know someone in the White House.” Let’s talk about the tech and White House. When we think of the tech industry of the 2010s, we think of progressive, optimistic ideals. Now, we’re seeing the hard tech era and tech leaders cutting DEI and supporting Trump. For those of us who weren’t there, was the tech industry of the 2010s just marketed differently, or did it really operate differently? For workers, it was genuinely really different. It was peak Obama optimism era, and it was 100 percent sincere. The creature comforts were really good, the benefits were great, the holiday parties were huge. And structurally, tech companies were genuinely providing upward mobility for people. They were genuine advocates for H-1B visas. People now are at this point where they're so beaten down they're kind of like, “Was it all a lie?” But I had enough visibility and access, like I’ve had dinner with Jeff Bezos, I’ve been in the room, and I can say they were different. They have changed, and been changed by intentional political actors like Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin. And now they’ve pickled each others’ brains. Do you think today’s founders have to move in this more libertarian direction to survive in this industry? They don’t even have to move. I talk to young founders these days and for them, there’s no other world than the Trump world. I ask them what inspired them to go into tech and they say they read Marc Andreessen’s manifesto, they read Peter Thiel’s books, and I think, “Oh, your brain’s cooked.” They come in pre-pickled. But everyone else who could have told an alternate narrative has been hounded out of the industry. In terms of the libertarian bent, those intentional political actors like Peter Thiel were very intentional about it. They created their own media ecosystem. They created Substack — they, meaning Andreessen Horowitz is a big investor — and paid to have content on there that would drive users to their own media. They took over culture. On the topic of VC media ecosystems, I saw the Thread you posted a few days ago about common things VCs believe. One was “Platforms need Nazis on them.” What do you mean by that? Well, it’s inciting. These guys like Thiel and [White House AI czar David] Sacks have been fixated for 30 years on trying to normalize and re-assert the public use of slurs. One of the examples they use [in their 1998 polemic The Diversity Myth] is the r-slur, which had just fallen out of favor in the early ‘90s. And they were explicitly saying not being able to use these slurs reflects growing political power from these groups, and that's why we need to bring them back. I have these notes that I’ve written, and I need to wait until I can like spend my entire waking hours defending the onslaught of shit I’ll get for writing it, but I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. That is dark. I can’t even contain my reaction to that. That is scary. I want to be wrong. But, yeah, they want to make sure [marginalized groups] don’t have power, and that’s signified by having Nazis on a platform. On that note of power, with all the layoffs and the bleakness among the workforce, do you think we’re going to see any sort of labor power movement in the tech industry? I’m hopeful. There was a moment in 2018, 2019, 2020, early COVID, when I thought there was going to be a moment. That’s when you had Amazon workers unionize in Staten Island [in 2022] and the first Google union [in 2021]. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that in the next 18 months after that they put $10 billion into teaching tools how to code. Like, ChatGPT comes at the end of 2022, right? It’s not entirely because of that, but it’s not not because of that. Also, like I said, [tech workers’] brains are pre-pickled. They don’t know the first thing about labor, and they’re trepidatious about learning because it’s coded “other.” Like, solidarity with the people serving meals in their workplaces is terrifying, because those people are completely disposable. None of those people have equity, none of those people have any job security. To somebody graduating college in 2026, would you recommend a career in tech? I think it’s hard. But compared to what? Compared to being a prison guard? Yes. But I do think tech is going to be the industry that is most changed by AI. Right now, ChatGPT can write a memo for you, write code for you. But the tools they’re building now, it’ll be more like one tool will replace an entire team of software engineers. For someone entering college in 2026, would you recommend studying computer science? It puts a pit in my stomach to say it, but no. I think [coding] should be part of people’s lives, for sure. But should you go into it as a career? I feel the same way about it when somebody says to me, “I’m going to learn an instrument for a living.” I’m like, “Well, hold on.” If you’re going to be the best in the world at that instrument, okay, go ahead. But if you’re not going to be the best in the world, it’s going to be a hard road for you. Last year, we heard so much about the AI bubble. Do you think we’ll see a crash in 2026? They’ve sort of economically engineered themselves out of crashing, and this is sort of similar to the de-risking of venture capital. When there's no risk, you don’t have crashes and you don’t have bailouts. And this is sort of, again, a feature of fascism versus capitalism. It was trendy in the last couple of years to call where we’re at “late-stage capitalism.” Would you call this fascism? Yeah, we’re there. Okay, the million dollar question: Do you still feel optimistic about the tech industry? Well, I have to believe. Part of the reason why is that I’ve seen it change people’s lives for the better. I think you can still build a thing that does connect the world and enables people to be part of the lives of people they love using technology. People can do it again. I think people are starting to understand the stakes. People understand that Elon Musk made a machine that makes child abuse material. I think it has to get pretty dire before people will make a change. But I think it can happen again. Do you see anybody leading that charge? There are some small projects, but I don’t want to blow anybody up yet. They’re fragile. Advertisement opens in a new tab.

Title: XRP Social Interest Explodes To Rival The Likes Of Bitcoin – Details

Time Published: 2026-01-17T05:00:46Z

XRP is in the center of crypto conversations, with social interest on X rising to levels that now rival Bitcoin. Recent data tracking the most searched cashtags on the platform shows XRP consistently appearing among the dominant assets drawing user attention. Interestingly, this surge in visibility is not happening in isolation but in tandem with a series of regulatory, institutional, and ecosystem developments within the XRP ecosystem. Data tracking the most-searched cashtags on the social media platform X shows XRP climbing alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a closer look at the data shows that XRP has received many more cashtags compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend was revealed by Nikita Bier, head of product at X, who shared a visualization chart of recent search behavior on X. The chart data shows that XRP has consistently appeared among the most queried assets on X since December 2025. Throughout the period depicted, top cashtag traffic has been fluctuating with daily rhythm as X users scan the platform and post on X with cashtags. The share of searches attributable to $xrp slices into a larger portion of the total during days in early January 2026, which indicates extended interest. On some dates, XRP’s presence in the search mix rivals that of $btc and $eth, which are typically the dominant anchors of crypto attention on social media. The chart also shows how other tags wax and wane alongside XRP’s performance. Some days show greater fragmentation, where interest is spread across stocks such as $iren (IREN), $tesla (Tesla), $gme (GameStop), and $asts (AST SpaceMobile Inc.). Nonetheless, the trajectory for XRP in the first half of January shows a growing base of people actively getting involved in the cryptocurrency. Top Cashtags Searched On X Social interest on X is a mix of speculation and ecosystem developments, which XRP is currently sitting at the center of. Behind this spike in attention are tangible developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. One recent example is how Ripple secured regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, obtaining both an Electronic Money Institution license and cryptoasset registration. Ripple’s regulatory buildout is expanding across Europe, with additional approvals in Luxembourg as part of its push to operate on both sides of the continent. Interestingly, there are also indications of deeper engagement with Ripple’s ecosystem on the institutional side. Rumors and mentions on X indicate that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has started to use Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin (RLUSD) as collateral. However, this move is yet to be confirmed by BlackRock. These updates, combined with many others, help explain why social interest and cashtag searches for XRP have recently been on the rise on X and other social media platforms.

Title: Ubisoft Cuts 55 more jobs in Sweden after Halifax studio closure and unionization vote

Toward the beginning of the new year, Ubisoft announced its second round of terminations amid an organizational restructuring that could affect an estimated 55 positions across its Swedish studios, including Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment. This follows a call for a voluntary leave program in the fall of 2025. Ubisoft informed its employees about these changes on January 13 and explained that they came after the completion of the voluntary program, concluding a long-term roadmap and evaluating the structure required to operate effectively. In a statement to IGN, Ubisoft said, “Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructuring that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.” The company further explained: This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clear visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainability over time. Ubisoft stressed that these layoffs were not tied to individual employee performance or recent game releases, but to structural requirements. One of the affected studios, Massive Entertainment, has been known for its work on The Division series, Star Wars Outlaws, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It has been one of Ubisoft’s key contributors since the studio’s acquisition in 2008. Ubisoft Stockholm, on the other hand, had opened recently, collaborated on the Avatar project, and was reported to be working on an unannounced project. Ubisoft reassured the studios that these restructuring shifts would not affect their long-term roadmaps and that projects currently in development, such as The Division 3, would not be affected. To put things in perspective, this is the second wave of job cuts under Ubisoft's helm in 2026. Earlier, on January 6, Ubisoft announced the shuttering of its Halifax studio, resulting in the termination of 71 employees. Strangely, this shutdown happened right after the studio voted in favor of unionization. However, Ubisoft insists that this decision was made in tandem with the company’s efforts to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and cut costs. The Halifax team has worked on mobile titles like Assassin’s Creed Rebellion. Buy Assassin's Creed Shadows on Amazon here IGN

Congress Just Loaded Up On These 2 Stocks! | 13:32 Dividendology | 241K subscribers | 157,468 views | January 13, 2026 Unusual Whales (Excerpt) Read more at youtube.com ... [transcript] Congressional Trading Report 2025 Unusual Whales, the website that tracks congressional trading, just released their full report on Congress trading in 2025. And essentially like every single year, especially since 2020, there are plenty of congressional members who way outperform the S&P 500, with multiple members of Congress even returning well over 50%. Now, while this report is for the full year 2025, we’ve already seen a couple of interesting trades as we head into 2026. So, in this video, we’re going to be looking at two stocks that members of Congress have been recently buying. To analyze these two stocks, we’re going to be using forecaster.biz, which you can check out at the link in the description. It’s a tool that I’ve started using more, and I like that you can easily overlay things like sales, net income, price to earnings, and dividends over the share price, so you can see correlation. But, let’s go ahead and dive in. Stock Analysis: Broadcom (AVGO) The first stock that members of Congress have been buying is Broadcom, stock ticker AVGO. Now, this is a stock that’s already a large position in Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio. It’s currently the second largest position. And as you might already know, Broadcom’s performance over the last 5 years has just been exceptional, up 673%. If we look at the last 3 years, they’re up about 500%, and in the last year alone, up 53.76%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. Now, of course, what’s interesting about this is if we overlay what’s gone on with the sales for this company in the last 5 years, you can see that the share price has essentially followed the sales growth of the business. And on top of this, they’ve continued to grow dividends at a very high rate. In fact, if we scroll down, we can see back just in 2017, they were paying out about 10 cents per share in dividends. And look, now it’s more than 6x at about 65 cents per share. Congressional Trading Insights Now, let’s talk about congressional trading for a moment. If we jump over to the political tab here on Forecaster, one of the things we will notice is there is already significant congressional buying in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.

Congress Just Loaded Up On These 2 Stocks! | 13:32 Dividendology | 241K subscribers | 157,468 views | January 13, 2026 Unusual Whales (Excerpt) Read more at youtube.com ... [transcript] Congressional Trading Report 2025 Unusual Whales, the website that tracks congressional trading, just released their full report on Congress trading in 2025. And essentially like every single year, especially since 2020, there are plenty of congressional members who way outperform the S&P 500, with multiple members of Congress even returning well over 50%. Now, while this report is for the full year 2025, we’ve already seen a couple of interesting trades as we head into 2026. So, in this video, we’re going to be looking at two stocks that members of Congress have been recently buying. To analyze these two stocks, we’re going to be using forecaster.biz, which you can check out at the link in the description. It’s a tool that I’ve started using more, and I like that you can easily overlay things like sales, net income, price to earnings, and dividends over the share price, so you can see correlation. But, let’s go ahead and dive in. Stock Analysis: Broadcom (AVGO) The first stock that members of Congress have been buying is Broadcom, stock ticker AVGO. Now, this is a stock that’s already a large position in Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio. It’s currently the second largest position. And as you might already know, Broadcom’s performance over the last 5 years has just been exceptional, up 673%. If we look at the last 3 years, they’re up about 500%, and in the last year alone, up 53.76%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. Now, of course, what’s interesting about this is if we overlay what’s gone on with the sales for this company in the last 5 years, you can see that the share price has essentially followed the sales growth of the business. And on top of this, they’ve continued to grow dividends at a very high rate. In fact, if we scroll down, we can see back just in 2017, they were paying out about 10 cents per share in dividends. And look, now it’s more than 6x at about 65 cents per share. Congressional Trading Insights Now, let’s talk about congressional trading for a moment. If we jump over to the political tab here on Forecaster, one of the things we will notice is there is already significant congressional buying in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.
