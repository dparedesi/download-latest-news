The Taiwanese American CEO is widely credited with transforming AMD from a struggling semiconductor firm on the brink of collapse into a global powerhouse competing head-to-head with Intel and Nvidia. When Su joined AMD in 2012, the company's market value was under $2 billion. Within a decade of her leadership, AMD's innovations in high-performance computing and graphics, especially the Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, catapulted the company's value to roughly $270 billion as of October 2025. But Su's leadership has not been without challenges. AMD's two largest competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are now working together in a strategic collaboration. Under the second Trump administration, export regulations related to China, one of AMD's largest markets, are also constantly changing. Here's a look at the timeline of Su's career, from her early life in New York City to her role as one of the most influential women in tech and innovation: Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1969, to Su Chun-hwai and Sandy Lo. Her family immigrated to the US when she was around the age of three, because her father, a statistician, was pursuing his graduate studies at the University of Texas in Austin. Her mother at that time was an accountant. The family eventually settled down in Queens, New York City. As a child, Su liked to take apart and rebuild remote-controlled cars and other gadgets, which sparked her interest in engineering. She eventually attended The Bronx High School of Science and graduated in 1986. Su attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston for many years and focused on electrical engineering. She eventually completed her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees all at MIT throughout the 1990s. Su's doctoral work on MOSFETs — tiny electronic switches inside computer chips — helped cement her future in some of the world's best-known semiconductor companies. After leaving the academic environment, Su worked in engineering, research, and managerial positions at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor. As the lead scientist at the IBM Semiconductor R&D Center, she contributed to the development of copper interconnects in chips, replacing aluminum ones. Her later role as senior vice president and general manager at Freescale, where she prepared the company for its IPO, gave Su the experience she needed to take on roles beyond research. Su joined AMD in 2012 as the general manager of Global Business Units. AMD's market cap that year was a little less than $2 billion. At that time, most of AMD's revenue came from traditional chips for PCs. However, the PC market was shrinking in the early 2010s while demand for smartphones and tablets was booming. AMD began to adopt a "semi-custom" approach, which involved taking its core technologies and modifying them based on individual customer needs. This approach helped secure contracts to design and manufacture chips for Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which reduced reliance on the PC market. In October 2014, Su was promoted to become President and CEO of AMD. In 2014, AMD had a large but scattered portfolio of chips for PCs, embedded systems, graphics, and low-power mobile, but the lack of focus was causing the company to lose market share to Nvidia and Intel. In a change of direction for the company, Su decided to discard the market of low-power chips with small margins to focus on producing high-end chips for the cloud, data centers, and consoles. The development of the Ryzen chips helped revive its market share among consumer products, while the simultaneous launch of the EPYC processor chips helped carve its share among data centers and servers. Companies with a large demand for cloud, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, have all been adopting EPYC chips. In 2018, AMD also managed to launch the world's first 7-nanometer data center GPUs, namely the Radeon Instinct MI50 and MI60. By 2020, AMD's market cap had reached over $110 billion. Before Su started gracing magazine covers, she went viral in a clip from the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, where Formula 1 commentator Martin Brundle yelled, "Excuse me, Ma'am, do you speak English?" at the CEO, who was sponsoring the event. "I'm with AMD," Su said, a response that immediately gained her the internet reputation of being humble. The original clip on YouTube has garnered more than 750,000 views and continues to circulate on Instagram Reels as an example of humility. In 2022, Su became the first MIT alumna to make a gift for a building that will bear her own name. Originally called Building 12, the home of MIT.nano was renamed the Lisa T. Su Building. Su also regularly appears at MIT's doctoral commencement ceremonies and established the Lisa Su Fellowship Fund, which supports female graduate students at MIT who have made accomplishments in nanotechnology. Su leads a very private life outside her role at AMD. Her spouse is Daniel Lin, but it is unclear when the pair got married or if they have children. There are no verifiable records of Lin's profession, and he is not a public figure, though the pair often appear in public events together. Su told Wired what keeps her going: She boxes with a trainer at her house for exercise, enjoys a good passion tea lemonade from Starbucks, and gets between five and six hours of sleep every night — seven on weekends. Su's work at AMD was recognized by Time magazine in 2024, which named her CEO of the Year. She became the first woman to receive this title. Su and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia and the biggest competitor to AMD, are actually related. They are first cousins, once removed, with Huang being the elder. Su's maternal grandfather is the eldest brother of Huang's mother. Despite both immigrating to the US from Taiwan as children, they did not grow up together and had never met until well into their respective careers. AMD's business has grown more than a hundred times since Su took the wheel, but it is still just a fraction of the size of the $4.4 trillion Nvidia. When asked if she thinks she could outcompete Nvidia, Su told Wired in an August interview that she doesn't necessarily want to be compared to Intel and Nvidia, because "the market is humongous" and she sees plenty of opportunities. On September 18, Intel and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration to develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products together, sending Intel shares up 23% as of market close on the same day and denting AMD's stock. The collaboration is anticipated to create significant pressure on AMD by combining Nvidia's AI expertise with Intel's hardware. In March, a team of analysts from SemiAnalysis published a report that AMD's graphics processing unit is still inferior to that of Nvidia's, because AMD's existing software is preventing the chip from reaching its full potential. But Su was not angry. Instead, she hopped on a 90-minute call with the SemiAnalysis's lead analyst the next day to hear him out. "Feedback is a gift even when it's critical," Su wrote in a post on X after the call, "We have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations, but there is lots more we can do to enable the broad ecosystem." Similar to Nvidia's H20 chips, AMD has developed chips specifically for the Chinese market in response to past US export control regulations, namely the MI308 AI chips. In April, AMD estimated that the company would take a $800 million hit in revenue after Trump announced more stringent chip export controls that would ban MI308 from reaching its intended market. "We lead today because we have the best technology. However, if we're not able to fully have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play," said Su in a US Senate hearing in May regarding export controls. "They may not be as good as we are today, but frankly, usage really spurs innovation." In July, the restriction was lifted, and AMD said it would resume compliant shipments to China. By September, both Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the US government, in exchange for maintaining their export licenses. On September 4, Su attended an AI task force meeting at the White House, led by first lady Melania Trump, and subsequently attended a dinner event hosted by Trump alongside some of the biggest names in tech, including Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Su had previously endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, though she was not a member of a formal advisory board. In a September interview with Fox Business, Su said the AI Action Plan is an "excellent blueprint for what it takes for America to lead." The AI Action Plan has faced criticism for attempting to override state-level AI governance and withholding AI infrastructure funding from states with more stringent regulations. Jump to

Title: More CEOs want Elon Musk–style ‘moonshot’ pay packages—but comp experts are raising alarms

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. The all-or-nothing moonshot pay plan was a gambit so risky even Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith’s wife was against it. But Smith had started getting antsy around 2016, as he was approaching three decades at the company, Axon compensation committee chair Hadi Partovi told Fortune. Smith was talking more seriously to the board about his succession plan, who was next to lead the company, and what he would do next. Partovi knew Smith could make a lot more money if he launched a startup than if he made Axon worth 10 times as much under his previous comp plan. “This is when I realized we had a real problem,” said Partovi. Smith thrives in high-risk, high-reward environments, so the Axon board granted Smith a near carbon copy of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s moonshot pay plan but on a much smaller scale. The challenge to Smith was to grow the Taser stun gun and body-camera maker 10-fold over a 10-year performance period starting in 2018. From a base of $2.5 billion, Smith had to increase the company’s market cap by $1 billion to unlock each new tranche of stock options, for a total of 12 tranches and a market cap of $13.5 billion. In addition, Smith had to hit eight revenue-based operational or eight adjusted-Ebitda-based goals. During the decade he was supposed to work on achieving those goals, he would get almost nothing—no bonuses or other incentives, and his salary was about $31,000 a year. “In full candor, my wife was against me taking on the challenge, as she saw it as just too risky,” Smith wrote in a letter to investors in 2023. But Smith blew through all the goals and each of the 12 tranches in five years—half the time the board gave him—making Smith the highest-paid CEO last year with compensation valued at $165 million. The stock price grew more than 600% between 2018 when the board offered him the moonshot and 2023. After he unlocked the 12th tranche, Smith negotiated an $88 million reduction on his next performance plan (which will keep him at Axon until at least 2030 with a goal of driving the stock to $943.75) and directed it be granted to the lowest-paid workers at Axon, showering them with surprise stock grants based on their years of tenure at the company. “The best is yet to come,” Smith wrote to investors in his letter this year. Smith shooting the moon—twice, potentially—represents a resurgent breed of executive compensation that has captured the imaginations of a growing number of CEOs. Moonshot wanderlust initially kicked into high gear after Elon Musk’s groundbreaking 2017 award from Tesla, once valued as high as $56 billion before it was twice rescinded owing to a legal challenge. Moonshot grants, not to be confused with an outsize stock grant known as a “mega grant” for its sheer size, tie CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible performance targets, explained Eric Hoffmann, vice president and chief data officer at comp consulting firm Farient Advisors. CEOs don’t get the awards unless they hit specific valuation hurdles and operational goals, he said, and the performance periods are typically five, seven or 10 years, rather than the more standard three-year period. “It should be difficult to get these awards,” said Hoffmann. “You have to create a lot of value in order to earn these kinds of awards.” Traditional CEO pay packages include a base salary, an annual cash bonus, and a longer-term equity incentive award often based on time and performance goals. According to compensation data firm Equilar, median compensation among S&P 500 CEOs was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% over the year prior. Moonshot awards, however, upend the traditional compensation model while also bucking the trend of billionaire tech founders like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Larry Page, and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who all held large equity stakes and focused on making them more valuable, noted Hoffmann. The key distinction is that those founders built wealth by focusing on increasing the value of their existing equity stakes, while taking minimal or no compensation, rather than seeking massive equity grants on top of their founder stakes, said Hoffmann. The moonshot model is a departure—seeking both founder equity upside plus additional compensation awards. “This way of wealth building is different than what was used during the dotcom era,” he noted. The upside to the moonshot is an enormous payout and a growing slice of company ownership if an executive can deliver transformational growth, but investors aren’t always wild about them, and moonshots don’t come without significant risk, said Todd Sirras, a managing director with consulting firm Semler Brossy who has advised clients on these deals. Companies are “willing to bet all of these ungodly amounts of money on one person thinking, ‘That’s the right machine we need for the factory,’” said Sirras. But there’s a fundamental flaw in this approach because people are unpredictable—unlike factory equipment. “Human beings are terrible machines,” Sirras told Fortune. “They’re emotional. Their attention gets divided thinking about what airplane they’re going to buy. It’s more risky to invest in a human being than it is to invest in a machine because human beings break in different and unpredictable ways.” Until now, the moonshot offers have been almost exclusive to founder-CEOs and almost always established pre-IPO, said Sirras. Semler Brossy’s database of about 80 moonshot awards includes dozens issued during the SPAC IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 that are now “dead in the water” because companies failed to meet their valuation targets, he added. With fewer IPOs in recent years and fewer moonshots, there are about 16 that exist among large publicly traded companies—and even fewer CEOs who have achieved maximum payouts, including Smith and Musk, according to research from Claire Kamas, a senior data analyst at Farient Advisors. Other companies that have awarded the grants include Airbnb, DoorDash, Oracle, ServiceNow, and RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, Kamas found. But the high-profile nature of the awards and the eye-popping figures associated with them are pushing board-level compensation committees that negotiate CEO pay to prepare for conversations about similar packages. Farient has gotten queries from compensation committee chairs who are already preparing for how they will address the situation when the CEO comes to them about a moonshot plan. In one case, the CEO isn’t a founder but a manager hired to run the company, Hoffmann noted. He isn’t a fan of moonshot awards, particularly in cases where CEOs already hold significant ownership stakes and control over their companies. “From a firm perspective, it is our view that these plans are generally not in the best interests of the organizations, the stakeholders, and shareholders in these companies,” said Hoffmann. “To me, a lot of these feel like a lottery ticket, a winner-take-all.” Despite the risk, Sirras sees these awards rising in popularity again, and he sees new trends emerging: Founders are granting moonshots to their “anointed successors,” he said. Real estate platform Opendoor Technologies this month granted a moonshot potentially worth $2.8 billion and an 11% slice of the company to new CEO Kaz Nejatian. Sirras said that award looks to be the first of its kind, and the board likely offered it to Nejatian because of a blessing from Opendoor’s cofounders, Eric Wu and Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois. Wu and Rabois returned to the board alongside Nejatian’s hiring and invested $40 million of equity capital into the company. Sirras said the same trend seems to be occurring in private equity. For instance, when founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts of KKR stepped down, the firm in 2021 granted co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall 1.2 million shares of KKR Holdings, valued at about $75 million, as part of their promotions. That same year, Apollo Global Management granted copresidents Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman the potential to earn more than $860 million in stock. Zelter was promoted to president in 2025, and Marc Rowan remains CEO. In addition to controlling founders who are planning leadership transitions and “founder-anointed successors,” the new wave of awards will likely also go to leading-edge executives in scenarios in which founders are making investment decisions, said Sirras. The arms race for talent between OpenAI and Meta and the reported compensation packages Zuckerberg has offered come to mind, he added. “From a design perspective, the magnitude is mind-boggling,” said Sirras. He compared it to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras wrote in an email. Alongside moonshots for founder-anointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T. rex fence,” the rise of “awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland,” Sirras wrote. The awards can also prompt investors to revolt. Business payments company Corpay awarded CEO Ronald Clarke 850,000 performance-based stock options valued at $55.6 million in 2021. The award had stock price hurdles of $350 and $400 and Clarke got no long-term equity grants in 2020, 2022, and 2023. In 2024, the comp committee canceled 300,000 stock options subject to the $400 hurdle and modified the criterion for 550,000 stock options subject to the $350 hurdle to require that Corpay hit a closing stock price at or above $350 for at least three trading days by the end of 2024. Clarke achieved the modified hurdle on Oct. 23, 2024. Corpay told investors the change was meant to “align Mr. Clarke’s realized pay with that of shareholders who benefited from the increased stock level over $350 before the modification, but prior to the modification the stock had not closed above $350 for 10 consecutive days, which was the pre-modification hurdle.” In other words, the board made it simpler for Clarke to earn the stock options by reducing the target from 10 consecutive trading days above $350 to just three trading days, a hurdle he cleared shortly after the change. The stock didn’t hit $400 until February 2025 and is currently trading at just under $300. The company’s 2025 Say-on-Pay vote—a thumbs-up, thumbs-down nonbinding vote on executive pay—only got support from 53.5% of votes cast. Over the past 14 years, the Russell 3000 index saw average support of about 91% for pay programs. Corpay did not respond to a request for comment. At Axon, Smith’s moonshot deal differs from Musk’s in another key way: It’s open to Smith’s direct reports on down to line workers at Axon, making employees eligible for a version of Smith’s moonshot deal. Workers could give up some salary, put some of their pay at risk, and work to hit revenue targets. Plus, every employee in the U.S. got a grant of 60 performance stock units that vested according to the same milestones in Smith’s award—a move almost unheard of in corporate America. No one other than Smith was able to essentially give up all their pay, said Partovi, mostly because Smith was independently successful enough that if he didn’t cut it and got nothing, he had enough of a cushion. Roughly $75 million in employee compensation was locked up as at-risk pay so employees could take part in the moonshot. “I really think that was a driver behind why the company grew so fast,” said Partovi. “Any element of infighting was gone—everybody was suddenly like, ‘We’re all in this together.’” Smith’s 2023 award went through a significant negotiation process where Partovi heard directly from shareholders about everything they didn’t like about the first plan so he could debug it. The board also attempted to legal-proof it against the type of challenge that Musk’s moonshot faced, prompting one of the compensation committee members who had socialized with Smith to resign from the committee. The board also changed the vehicle type from performance options to restricted stock, added in speed brakes that would keep Smith at Axon, and made it more difficult for Smith to hit the last few tranches. Partovi said he addressed every question from shareholders about misalignment in the plan during the board’s negotiation process with Smith. Ultimately, Partovi credits the moonshot deal with transforming the corporate culture around shared risk and high reward with a version of a high-stakes compensation plan rolled out to everyone at the company. In his view, it helped to eliminate dynamics where direct reports and general employees resent outsize pay for the chief executive, he said. “The big thing is, the CEO is taking a risk in giving up his pay, and you don’t want it to turn out to be shareholders win and the CEO wins or shareholders lose and the CEO still wins,” said Partovi. “I don’t know if grants like Rick’s make sense for everybody, but they strongly make sense for Rick Smith at Axon.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Plus, every employee in the U.S. got a grant of 60 performance stock units that vested according to the same milestones in Smith’s award—a move almost unheard of in corporate America. No one other than Smith was able to essentially give up all their pay, said Partovi, mostly because Smith was independently successful enough that if he didn’t cut it and got nothing, he had enough of a cushion. Roughly $75 million in employee compensation was locked up as at-risk pay so employees could take part in the moonshot. “I really think that was a driver behind why the company grew so fast,” said Partovi. “Any element of infighting was gone—everybody was suddenly like, ‘We’re all in this together.’” Smith’s 2023 award went through a significant negotiation process where Partovi heard directly from shareholders about everything they didn’t like about the first plan so he could debug it. The board also attempted to legal-proof it against the type of challenge that Musk’s moonshot faced, prompting one of the compensation committee members who had socialized with Smith to resign from the committee. The board also changed the vehicle type from performance options to restricted stock, added in speed brakes that would keep Smith at Axon, and made it more difficult for Smith to hit the last few tranches. Partovi said he addressed every question from shareholders about misalignment in the plan during the board’s negotiation process with Smith. Ultimately, Partovi credits the moonshot deal with transforming the corporate culture around shared risk and high reward with a version of a high-stakes compensation plan rolled out to everyone at the company. In his view, it helped to eliminate dynamics where direct reports and general employees resent outsize pay for the chief executive, he said. “The big thing is, the CEO is taking a risk in giving up his pay, and you don’t want it to turn out to be shareholders win and the CEO wins or shareholders lose and the CEO still wins,” said Partovi. “I don’t know if grants like Rick’s make sense for everybody, but they strongly make sense for Rick Smith at Axon.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

If you can invest in music royalties, why can't you also invest in "technology royalties?" That's what Althera42 wants to make possible, betting on revenue growth and scalability of technology startups without having to buy in at high valuations. Founded by Caspar Macqueen, a former BlackRock executive, and Christian Czernich, founder of the private credit firm Round2 Capital, the new fund plans to provide working capital to technology companies in Europe without taking an equity stake. Althera42 will focus on investing in intellectual property that transforms society through agentic AI, data infrastructure, defense and security, robotics and automation, software-enabled services and health and well-being. Don't Miss: "Althera42's royalty investments allow companies to access capital without diluting equity or taking on rigid debt obligations," Business Insider reported from a company factsheet released in September. According to its website, Althera42 looks to invest in founder-led and late-stage private companies that have software and proprietary technology at their core. Althera42 will build customized deals to receive a fixed percentage of the technology companies' future revenue over several years. Through the royalties model, Althera42 can combine the upside of venture capital with the consistent cash flow of private debt, Czernich told Business Insider. Fund gains will go out to investors quarterly. The fund will charge a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. Althera42 is targeting companies with annual revenue between roughly $17 million and $117 million (€10 million and €100 million) from recurring or licensing models. Trending: Kevin O'Leary Loves ‘Wonderful Recurring Cash Flows' — These Small Industrial Assets Deliver Just That Royalty investing is the new capital paradigm in an intellectual property-based global economy, according to the company's website. In its stated mission, Althera42 wants to establish technology royalties as a new asset class. It hopes to copy the successful playbook used for tapping into the predictable revenue streams of music and pharmaceuticals. Althera42's website boasts being architects of a new capital model, "transforming recurring revenue into investable royalty streams." Czernich told Business Insider, "I do genuinely believe it will be a new asset class." See Also: Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund Just Backed This Farmland Manager — Accredited Investors Can Join the Same Fund Althera42 believes royalty investing aligns its success with that of the company it funds. However, the firm does so by empowering companies to "retain control, by accelerating their impact with capital support that does not compromise their vision or leadership." According to Pitcher Partners, a national association of independent accounting firms in Australia, royalty investing is found across several industries: music, energy, mining, pharmaceuticals and software. Major private equity firms Blackstone and KKR entered the music industry in 2021 and 2022, deploying $500 million to $1 billion, and the energy royalties sector in North America is estimated to be worth between $500 billion and $1 trillion, according to Pitcher Partners' website. Macqueen, formerly BlackRock's head of U.K., Middle East and Africa for the alternatives business Aladdin, told Business Insider the firm plans to pull in $300 million with its first fund and complete 15 to 20 deals. Most deals would likely be in Europe and the U.K., potentially with some North American investments. Althera42 has offices in London and New York.

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. What if you could squeeze, say, a 70% dividend yield from a fast-growing AI stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) or Palantir (PLTR)? Sounds great, right? Instead of relying just on these stocks’ prices for your profits (since dividends are, frankly, the furthest thing from their CFOs’ minds), you get their returns as high-yielding dividends. That’s something a new breed of ETFs is promising. These funds, which are gaining in popularity, hold just one stock—usually a Palantir, Tesla (TSLA) or NVIDIA—and trade options on that one stock to deliver stated yields often way above 50%. Does it work? First, let me say that, as someone who has covered 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) for over a decade, I get the sentiment behind these funds. Big income streams can create financial independence—who wouldn’t want as big of a yield as possible? But there’s a line where a dividend goes from appealing to dangerous—and it’s well below the stated 70% distribution rate, as of this writing, on a single-stock ETF like, say, the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY). That’s because, what these funds’ massive yields give, their share prices can easily take away. Consider the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY), which aims to deliver that 70% income stream by holding C3.ai (AI), a developer of AI apps for business. As I write this, AIYY investors have seen a total return of nearly negative 50% since the start of the year. With nearly half of their capital now lost in 2025 (with dividends included), those holding AIYY must be wondering what went wrong. Let’s start with that dividend, because there’s a key thing to note here: Even though AIYY’s website says its distribution rate is 71%, it also tells us that the fund’s 30-day SEC yield is only 4.8%. This means the fund’s net investment income (which can only be calculated by a strict SEC-mandated formula and excludes options income, which can be unpredictable) is much lower than that 70%—which is the payout as a percentage of the fund’s assets. Moreover, AIYY’s distributions keep falling, down 63% in 2025. Let me clear—not all of YieldMax’s 57 ETFs are losing money this year. In fact, most are up. The best return goes to the YieldMax PLTR Option Income Strategy ETF (PLTY), with a stated 49.4% yield. This fund has returned 77.9% for 2025 and is up much more since its inception in late 2024. So, have we found the secret to financial independence here? After all, with this 49.4% income stream, it takes only about $203,000 in upfront investment to get a six-figure income stream! Except, well, there’s a lot of risk behind this seemingly impressive chart. As you probably guessed from the fund name, this ETF tracks Palantir, whose stock has surged as the company wins more government contracts. If you predicted PLTR’s surge, congratulations—that’s impressive. But an investor who knew to invest in PLTR should’ve just bought that stock instead, since PLTY (in purple below) has badly lagged it. This problem is endemic to single-stock ETFs: These funds try to “translate” growth stocks’ gains into big dividends, but in so doing expose us to the risks of a single stock, with less upside. Sure, the income is great when the stock is rising, but that income will shrink if the stock drops. That’s what happened to the 56.2%-yielding YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF (MRNY), which holds Moderna (MRNA) and is down 39% in 2025 and down even more since its IPO in early 2024. Anyone who bought MRNY and enjoyed the huge yields at the start of 2024 probably thought they were really on to something, as the fund’s total return rose into the spring. They then saw their fortunes reverse as the fund’s price fell. That’s the fate I expect for the aforementioned PLTY if the stock it tracks—again, Palantir—drops. And I see that as likely, since Palantir’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at a stratospheric 278 as I write this. So what are these funds for, then? To be honest, I’m not sure. As we’ve seen, investors are almost always better off just buying the underlying stocks. What’s more, some of these ETF issuers are venturing into even riskier territory, like the recently released “Bonk Income Blast ETF,” which doesn’t just invest in crypto, but also in “other crypto ETFs, including non-US crypto-ETFs,” according to its SEC filing. This means investors will wind up paying the fees for this ETF, as well as fees for the ETFs it owns. Plus they’re exposing themselves to the risks of the crypto market and the risks of foreign markets—including potentially lax regulation—too. There’s just no reason to take risks like those when you can get predictable, diversified dividends from CEFs. Sure, CEFs don’t offer the mind-blowing yields of YieldMax and its ilk. But we’ll happily take that “lower” payout—bearing in mind many CEFs yield more than 8%, if it lets us sleep peacefully at night. Moreover, we benefit from CEFs discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), which hold the potential for future upside. ETFs—single stock or no—never offer us a discount. I think you’ll agree that this is a far better deal than a 70%-yielder that’s dropped around 50% in less than a year.

Title: The War Over Defense Tech

Last October, on a Martin Luther–inspired website called www.18theses.com, a software executive named Shyam Sankar published a four-thousand-word polemic with the title “The Defense Reformation.” “As a nation, we are in an undeclared state of emergency,” it begins. There follows a litany of provocations: Chinese escalation in the South China Sea, Iranian attacks on US military bases, the October 7 attacks in Israel, “an estimated 1 million casualties in brutal combat in Ukraine.” All this, Sankar writes, amounts to “a hot Cold War II.” It is a war, he argues, for which the US is catastrophically underprepared: “In the current environment, American industries can’t produce a minimum line of ships, subs, munitions, aircraft, and more.” The problem lies with American capitalism in its present form, which—as Sankar lamented last year on a military podcast called The Merge—has left legacy defense firms like Lockheed Martin dominated by “fifth-generation MBA cadre[s]” who care more “about cash flow and buybacks and dividends than…about the honest hard work of engineering innovation.” Under these conditions the defense department’s subsidies for private business, he writes in “The Defense Reformation,” have neither “the supposed advantages of a planned economy nor the (far superior) advantages of a free market.” Sankar is the CTO and executive vice-president of Palantir, the start-up cofounded in 2003 by Peter Thiel that specializes in a peculiar hybrid of big-data manipulation and McKinsey-style consulting work. Many of Sankar’s Palantir colleagues and peers at other Thielworld start-ups—notably Anduril, which bills itself as a pioneering disruptor in software-heavy military hardware—have advanced a similar criticism of the neoliberal state, bemoaning its declining interventions in manufacturing and research and lambasting the legacy defense firms, often nicknamed “primes,” for their sclerosis, inefficiency, and alleged monopolistic behavior. The innovative, capitalist spirit and manly vitalism that defined the defense department through the cold war is, for this group, long gone. The task of the hour, as Sankar writes in “The Defense Reformation,” is therefore nothing less than “to resurrect the American Industrial Base.” You might think this would mean something like what, under the previous administration, went by the name Bidenomics: initiatives such as the CHIPS Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, which paled in comparison to total federal defense spending—the combined estimated cost of those two bills, which would be spread over a number of years, was about half the annual defense bill—but nonetheless aimed to bring high-tech manufacturing back to US shores. You would be wrong. “The most important and malleable weapons system,” Sankar writes, is not missiles or other military hardware but software, by which he presumably means technologies like large-scale data manipulation, narrow forms of computerized optimization applied to “smart” weapons systems and robotics, sensors, autonomous weapons systems, and artificial intelligence. Investing lavishly in such technology and teaching “our warriors…to wield the software industrial base to maximize lethality” will catalyze what Sankar has elsewhere called a “software-driven reindustrialization” akin to previous industrial revolutions based around water, steam, coal, or oil. For a range of figures in the emergent defense-tech sector to which Palantir and Anduril belong, this will require wrenching guaranteed contracts from the bloated primes and promoting competition by having branches of the armed services bid against one another, not to mention allowing even more sales elsewhere. It will also require binding the state closer to a range of tech giants—especially firms like Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft­—that have thus far, on this view, neglected their patriotic duty to engage in defense work and profited from feminized “ad-tech” instead. These arguments have found a broad and receptive audience. In recent years a range of politicians have aligned themselves with the priorities of defense-tech firms, especially as successive White Houses worry about a belligerent Russia, a rising China, and the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid-induced supply shocks—all of which have reenergized a longstanding criticism of Reagan-era political-economic shifts that hobbled productive industries. The Obama and Biden administrations both empowered tech companies at the expense of the primes; Biden, skeptical of free trade and hawkish on China, courted Silicon Valley firms that promised to bring back domestic manufacturing and reindustrialize the rust belt and former defense hubs. But in recent years talk about “software-driven reindustrialization” has become especially widespread on a faction of the new right. That the Trump adviser and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer could rail on X against Lockheed Martin, with its “woke agenda,” for “delivering F-35 fighter jets that are simply not ready for combat”—and that Elon Musk could respond to her that, in any case, “crewed aircraft will be destroyed instantly by cheap drone swarms”—owes much to the rhetoric of Sankar and his peers. This new Silicon Valley defense-tech and finance group—their grievances, ideology, and policy visions—has become central to Trump’s second term. Several defense-tech boosters have assumed powerful positions in the administration, most notably one of Anduril’s former senior directors, Michael Obadal, who was just confirmed as Army under secretary, the second-highest ranking civilian official in the Army. Since January Palantir and Anduril have received many billions in contracts, with more on the way. ICE has contracted Palantir since 2011 for software it uses to enforce sanctions and make arrests, and in April signed a new $30 million contract with the company to, in The New York Times’s words, “build a platform to track migrant movements in real time.” Presumably the deal will help ICE’s director, Todd Lyons, realize a vision he laid out that same month at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix, where he said that he wants his agency to run like Amazon Prime, “but with human beings.” Advertisement These trends show no signs of stopping. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Department of Defense—now calling itself the Department of War—to increase its spending on software, which, he stresses, is “at the core of every weapon and supporting system we field to remain the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” Trump has signed executive orders designed to ease restrictions on defense exports and speed up and reduce oversight of the DoD’s acquisition process. In September the army announced a new venture-capital-style model for procurement called “Fuze.” Firms like Palantir and their new constellation of Silicon Valley funders stand to benefit handsomely from these developments. “We’re moving to a software-driven, autonomous…battlefield,” the managing director for a prominent private equity firm said at a defense summit earlier this year. “Well, if you want daily software upgrades, you gotta pay software margins.” * Few would contest that the political economy of American defense is troubled. Defense monopolies have stifled competition; companies have slowed their investment in production and concentrated instead on payouts to themselves and shareholders; costs and schedules have spun out of control. By now, as the scholar William Hartung has written, the federal government’s ballooning defense budget goes increasingly to “costly, dysfunctional weapons systems that are ill-suited to addressing current challenges.” Yet venture-funded defense-tech firms like Palantir and Anduril have positioned themselves as the solution to these ills without any clear evidence that they can deliver on that promise. The problem, put simply, is that they don’t have expertise in building things. Because they are above all instruments of financialization, designed to bring future values into the present, they tend to be better at generating short-term profits and juicing shareholder value than at creating durable, high-performing software or hardware systems. Anduril and other companies that offer “autonomous,” AI-enhanced hardware, for instance, have by now attracted criticism from a range of commentators: the evidence indicates that, despite their claims to the contrary, Silicon Valley drones and counterdrones have underperformed in Ukraine, where fighters have tended to prefer cheaper, hardier Chinese and homegrown drones instead. Adopting Palantir’s signature data-organizing software, too, could have significant problems for companies and government agencies in the long term. The software’s code is closed-source and privately hosted by Palantir, which retains the power—subject to the terms of its contracts and to the extent they prove enforceable—to change, update, or terminate it. Using it as the “data backbone” for a vast and complicated system makes it distinctly costly and burdensome to switch software in the future, not to mention to train and retrain its users. Meanwhile, as several critics have argued, the user loses a significant measure of control over the system itself. “The single fundamental problem with the Palantir contract is that the government is outsourcing all of the work to one company in one go,” a data expert told the New Statesman earlier this year, “and what you get is vendor lock-in. The state doesn’t understand the work, they can’t see the work…. You develop no knowledge, no understanding of it.” On the podcast Second Breakfast, the lawyer and former Army officer Eric Robinson related that, when he used Palantir’s software in the 2010s, “they would recode your data ingest so you couldn’t export it again,” with the result that “you had to pay for their tech to effectively be part of your order of battle…. It often seems like a form of long-term rent seeking.” In the telling of companies like Palantir and Anduril, their innovation, efficiency, and software expertise qualify them to jump-start a new era of American industrial policy. But not only do they seem ill-suited for such a task, they have publicly backed the Trump administration as it destroys the foundations of what industrial policy the country has. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, has, for instance, denounced “wokeness” for “corrupting and corroding our institutions,” echoing the rhetoric that Trump and other Republicans have used to attack measures like the CHIPS Act for including some redistributive initiatives and giving workers benefits like child care. We are now in a situation, in other words, where an array of right-wing firms and think tanks perversely extol the virtues of industrial policy and American renewal even as they support politicians and financial institutions that are currently dismantling the infrastructure to actually do industrial policy. Advertisement How did we get here? The answer lies, in part, in the fact that defense-related industries like the semiconductor sector have themselves long obscured their real relationship to industrial policy. It is a central tragedy of the long US century that military Keynesianism—the use of military spending to spur economic growth and enable spending on welfare and other public goods—has been the organizing principle for the country’s economy and social life since World War II. The defense budget—last year’s allocation was close to $900 billion—goes not just to weapons construction but also to a welfare state within a state: housing, health care, and social services. It funds a great deal of civilian industry, from wooden pallets to satellites and smartphones, not to mention research fundamental to the US economy and some degree of economic redistribution. Because of its sheer scale and reach, defense spending is unique in its ability to facilitate regional coalitions across party lines by directing funding to specific geographical targets: state-specific projects, bases, consortia, and so on. National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons An armorer’s assistant installing a machine gun in a Lockheed P-38 plane at an aircraft plant in the Western US, circa November 1942 By forcing policymakers to appeal to “national security” (which since the 1980s has expanded to encompass “economic security”)1 to justify any efforts at industrial policy or social welfare, this system has long hobbled our ability to build a better world. But during the 1970s and 1980s, when a newly organized right wing took aim at state spending and capacity across the board, even the essential national-security fields of electronics and defense found their access to long-term government support under threat. To retain it, they arrived at a kind of truce. In public, these firms would happily chalk their success up to their own entrepreneurial genius. Under the radar, however, a range of policymakers and industry leaders worked to patch together a precarious, largely hidden system of government support that allowed the businesses—albeit in compromised form—to keep relying on federal planning, funding, and stewardship. Now the new Silicon Valley defense firms are taking advantage of this state of affairs to press their own interests. Rather than downplaying their reliance on the government in public while reaping the benefits of industrial policy in practice, though, they have done just the opposite, indulging in rhetoric about the return of the strong state and “reindustrialization” even as they help dismantle the state in the service of financial capital. Understanding the implications of this shift requires grasping the complexities of the relationship that tech and defense firms have long enjoyed with US state power. 2. In moments of “revolutionary crisis,” Karl Marx wrote, men “anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language.” The defense-tech elite are no exception: they talk obsessively about the past, transmuting political-economic reality into a story of great-men-as-founders. Karp praises the Manhattan Project and welcomes comparisons to Oppenheimer. A Los Angeles Times piece from last year discovered that Palmer Luckey, the much-profiled founder of Anduril, has a preoccupation with purchasing cold war military relics: the red nuclear phone, “a couple of submarines,” at least one ICBM site. He hopes one day, the profile notes, to acquire “the entire US ground-based nuclear deterrent system…to turn it into a vast museum.” Their account of twentieth-century military-economic history is distinctly revisionist. In his appearance last year on The Merge, Sankar explained how to fix the defense-industrial base. “The reality is you focus on winning,” he said: I’m not a founder of Palantir, but I think about going back to that World War II–era period and the immediate cold war, it was founders. We think of it as Northrop Grumman and Martin Marietta, but it was Jack Northrop and Glenn Martin and Howard Hughes and Henry Kaiser, and even inside of government, the Kelly Johnsons, the John Boyds. These are uniquely hardheaded, creative, difficult people that are required to win. And I think every start-up understands that. That’s what a start-up looks like. The truth is dramatically different. The two world wars turned industrial power into US military dominance not because they empowered the genius of individuals but because they built a new and formidable state.2 Industrial and state capacity—not to mention the relationship between industry and government—were forever transformed. World War I inaugurated the use of cost-plus contracts, which stipulate that the government pay for all the costs of development and production plus a set profit. World War II offered the US a taste of a centralized planned economy: the war effort consumed 57 percent of the national income, and the government itself converted all the plants it needed to manufacture war material.3 In 1942, for instance, the War Production Board—which centralized control of investment and production—forced the whiskey industry to divert 60 percent of its production to industrial alcohol and modernized productive processes. It would not be an exaggeration to attribute the many new industries that emerged, modernized, or accelerated in the postwar years—aeronautics, vastly improved automobiles and motors, chemical and especially petrochemical firms, modern shipbuilding, electronics, atomic energy, logistics—to centralized government planning and funding. With government help, as Hartung notes in his study Prophets of War, the aviation industry’s production increased by 13,500 percent.4 New plants cropped up across the country, especially in the South and West, inaugurating the long-term industrialization of those regions. Cooperative large-scale applied research proliferated through the National Defense Research Committee, which commandeered both industry and academic resources and personnel. In his 1992 study of US industrial policy, the historian Otis Graham noted that the Defense Plant Corporation built “some 30 percent of the plant capacity on which American mobilization depended,” which was crucial to the postwar aircraft industry.5 Business leaders resisted their subjection to government administrators, and as soon as the war was over they sought to erase these years from public memory. But the fact remained that US defense contractors and technology firms owed their existence to extensive, heavy-handed government planning. * Government support, oversight, and coordination of important industries largely persisted throughout the cold war. In the immediate postwar period military contracts slowed, but the Korean War ensured another boom that lasted until the wind down of the Vietnam War two decades later. The Department of Defense “directed a large portion of the nation’s scientific and engineering resources throughout the postwar era,” Graham wrote, “frequently picking winning technologies and products by supplying the military’s clients—chiefly the weapons, aerospace, telecommunications, and data processing industries—with R&D support and purchasing of output.” The government covered nearly all basic research (which mostly occurs at government labs and universities), and much of the research and development conducted by private industry. Companies had plenty of money to invest and reinvest in production—and the DoD pressured them to do just that. Science History Institute An employee inspecting the control board for a solvent recovery system at the Hercules Powder Company plant in Hopewell, Virginia, 1940s As the scholar Christophe Lécuyer shows in his study Making Silicon Valley, all this investment made the US semiconductor industry possible.6 DoD contracts remade Fairchild, the industry’s pioneering firm, into a major company, and Fairchild in turn brought suppliers and equipment-makers to the Bay Area. The DoD not only funded the development of microelectronics but prioritized incorporating them into military systems; starting in 1963, Lécuyer notes, proposals had to include them for the projects to receive funding. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara’s initiatives before and especially during the Vietnam War transformed defense spending and the industrial policy associated with it. Much was made by General Westmoreland, starting in the late 1960s, of the promise that war would become an “electronic battlefield,” with armies taking advantage of all “the advanced technology of communications, sensors, fire direction, and the required automatic data processing” to control the fighting from afar.7 That this vision failed to materialize and cost the US dearly—in lives, reputation, and resources—doesn’t seem to have led anyone to rethink its premises. In the late 1960s disenchanted defense workers organized to shift industries such as chemicals and electronics away from war and toward the public good, or at least toward private consumption—an effort known as “civilianization.” At the same time, a civilian market for computer chips was exploding. Those initiatives, the planned Vietnam wind down, and détente with the USSR all helped shrink the federal government’s spending on defense in general and military R&D in particular. But it was a brief experiment that came with significant backlash, helping propel Reagan to the presidency and shaping his industrial policy. The federal share of research dollars remained high for much of the cold war, funding the development of lasers, nuclear energy, rockets, aerospace, computers, scientific instruments, data processing, and telecommunications while neglecting automobiles, steel, pharmaceuticals, and textiles—all of which moved offshore to a greater degree than they already had. 3. The first major political-economic changes after World War II came with the neoliberal turn of the 1980s and 1990s. During these years several crises descended upon a range of productive sectors that had historically relied on federal industrial policy. Internationally, Japan perfected production techniques in high-tech manufacturing—of cars, machine tools, memory chips, and other electronics—and quickly approached dominance in many areas considered central to “national security,” like semiconductors and supercomputing. American pundits at the time identified this trend as a direct threat to American-style capitalism and US power.8 The period’s neoliberal economic reforms—which reduced and limited the nature of government spending while demonizing the most basic forms of long-term planning—weakened productive industries still further, leaving manufacturers beholden to shareholder demands for ever more profits and vulnerable to new threats from financial institutions. These conditions posed a distinct threat to productive sectors like the semiconductor industry. And yet Intel, which by 1992 was leading the industry in cutting-edge chips, managed to thrive nonetheless. When reporters asked how they did it, the company’s executives pointed to what they called “Moore’s Law,” the idea, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, that chips regularly became smaller and more powerful according to something like a natural principle. Moore’s Law became a fixture of the industry’s marketing presentations, press releases, and internal conferences.9 Over the years it helped convince defense leaders like Clinton’s secretary of defense, William Perry, and his protégée Ash Carter that technological solutions could eventually be found for their most pressing and difficult political problems. Moore’s Law remains an unquestioned assumption of scientific, military and national security state discourse and policy, undergirding the entire political-economic imagination of the post–cold war United States. Just as intellectuals started worrying that there might be fundamental limits to capitalist growth, it posited a horizon of infinite progress. The truth was more complicated. Intel, founded in 1968 by Moore and Robert Noyce, came to prominence by developing some of the first commercial metal-oxide semiconductor chips. Those semiconductors had immediate, tangible benefits, including low power consumption, high noise immunity, and cost efficiency. Working from that basis, the company did regularly improve its output with a kind of lawlike consistency in this era. But it wasn’t Moore’s Law that won the battle with the Japanese. Instead, Intel and others in the semiconductor industry built coalitions to carve out exceptions to many of the period’s neoliberal reforms, reaping the benefits of extraordinary state support. Among other things, the Reagan administration offered tax incentives to subsidize factory construction and investment in manufacturing, encouraged coordination and cartelization by offering antimonopoly relief and state planning, and used economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to force concessions from Japan, such as giving foreign—which in effect meant US—chip manufacturers 20 percent of their market share and sharing significant manufacturing knowledge. Intel Free Press/Wikimedia Commons Andy Grove (left), the longtime head of Intel, sitting with the company’s founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, 1978 Under Reagan it was an open secret that the government’s treatment of the semiconductor industry, among others, amounted to a form of industrial policy. These measures had the backing of a powerful—if peculiar—bipartisan coalition that was preoccupied with sustaining American hegemony: national security and foreign policy hawks, factions in the business world, and a group of tech-friendly liberals, like Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas and Tennessee senator Al Gore, who became known as the “Atari Democrats.” They were reacting to a new right that objected to industrial policy as such, on the grounds that any government planning and economic intervention smacked of communism: in late 1980 the first installment of the Heritage Foundation’s Mandate for Leadership—like its successor, Project 2025—called for destroying large swaths of government by loosening regulations and oversight, centralizing power in the executive, demolishing state capacity, and eliminating or significantly cutting funding for many programs and agencies. The new right lacked the political leverage to end industrial policy entirely. But between 1980 and 1993 they succeeded at making it politically toxic, forcing the industry and its allies to adjust their tactics. Bill Clinton, an Atari Democrat, took office hoping to build the US’s own version of Japan’s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry; however hostile he was to labor, he implemented significant industrial policy for semiconductors immediately after his election. After Newt Gingrich’s Contract for America coalition swept Congress in 1994, however, the administration’s room for maneuver narrowed. It was still able to ensure some level of subsidies and planning for semiconductor firms like Intel. But it came to rely heavily on foreign policy measures—like sanctions, trade deals, diplomatic pressure, and throwing around US power to shape new international economic organizations like the World Trade Organization—to open new markets and ensure other benefits for tech companies. By the end of Clinton’s second term, a kind of tacit settlement had locked into place. Even as they continued to depend on these various forms of state support, semiconductor companies, tech entrepreneurs who relied on ever-improving semiconductors, and politicians on both sides of the aisle would insist they owed their success to the information-tech revolution, with its promise of infinite growth and cheap consumer goods, all predicated on the work of individual entrepreneurial geniuses. This rift between rhetoric and reality has only grown since. Today’s executives hardly seem to understand the conditions of their own industries; it is as if, on some level, they believe the flattering public narrative their predecessors spun. During his interview on The Merge, Sankar remarked that he and his peers are “children…of a Noycean culture.” In a sense this is not untrue. Intel’s Noyce and Sankar both downplay their industry’s debt to industrial policy; Palantir, not unlike Intel before it, is in part in the business of selling what Wired recently called “a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems.” But Sankar clearly meant the analogy in a different sense: to lay claim to Noyce’s record of success, to brandish his legacy of American entrepreneurial technological genius, and to insist that Silicon Valley firms’ track record of such triumphs should entitle them to remake government in their own image. * The defense industry faced the same pressures that nearly destroyed US semiconductor firms at the dawn of the post–cold war era. In his last year in office Jimmy Carter reversed the cuts that had depressed the industry for much of the 1970s, and in his first term Reagan initiated an enormous military buildup. All this, Graham writes, strengthened the military’s claim on “the nation’s scientific and engineering resources, and thus its influence on industrial structure.” But other developments spelled trouble. By the early 1980s financial regulations were being loosened, and corporations were under increasing pressure—legal, managerial, and structural—to secure shareholder profits in the short term at the expense of long-term health. A low-margin productive industry like defense was badly suited to the era. By the mid-1980s firms were focusing on increasing their financial performance by using stock buybacks and cost-reduction strategies like just-in-time inventory management—ordering only enough resources to cover immediate needs. All this compromised their ability to respond flexibly to crises and to make high-quality products. In 1985 the Reagan administration started reducing defense spending again and limited other avenues for profit. Facing increased political scrutiny, Reagan officials had recently made a big show of auditing firms for the appearance of wasteful spending, introducing policies that tightened defense profits and increased accounting paperwork. Many companies, like GE, curtailed their defense wings or left the sector entirely to boost their stock values for an increasingly defense-skeptical Wall Street. The 1980s also saw the rise of corporate raiders, later known as private equity firms, which would acquire a majority share of a company’s stock, take control of its operations, and then “restructure” it, which usually meant stripping it for parts and paying themselves astronomical sums of money. Between 1982 and 1990 such outfits nearly destroyed several defense firms, including Martin Marietta and Lockheed, and left them weakened with large debt-to-equity ratios. With loosened financial rules and low margins came consolidation: between 1985 and 1988 ten of the top sixty defense firms acquired or were acquired by others. Perhaps no person’s career tracks how the defense industry navigated these changes more clearly than that of Norm Augustine. Born in 1935, Augustine got his start in defense at the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1958. His first foray into government came in 1965 as one of McNamara’s young hires, brought in from the private sector to cut waste using “economic efficiency” measures like cost-benefit analysis. He then ping-ponged between the public and private defense sectors: after serving as the under secretary of the Army he joined Martin Marietta, then one of the country’s largest defense firms. Between 1980 and 1982, meanwhile, he chaired the Defense Science Board, authoring reports on threats to the defense industrial base and its dependence on the troubled semiconductor sector. Rising in the ranks of Martin Marietta over the 1980s, Augustine saw that defense was in turmoil; he later referred to the decade as the industry’s “dark ages.” Denver Post/Getty Images Martin Marietta CEO Thomas G. Pownall (center) and Norman Augustine (right) talking with a shareholder, 1983 The fall of the USSR and Clinton’s electoral victory brought a new existential threat. Federal defense funding plummeted: between 1989 and 1997 procurement declined by 60 percent. The result was something like the industry’s Great Depression; in 1995 Augustine told a House committee that an estimated three quarters of the sector, about 90,000 firms, had evaporated in the span of a decade. As defense programs became fewer and more expensive, the remaining firms started making riskier bids, overpromising on cost, time, and quality. In 1993 Clinton’s defense secretary, Les Aspin, invited the CEOs of major defense firms to the Pentagon for a dinner that would become known as the “last supper.” The then-deputy defense secretary, William Perry, showed them a slideshow of necessary defense capacity: “We expect defense companies to go out of business,” he told them. When we talked in a recent interview, Augustine told me he feared the administration would nationalize at least significant parts of the industry. They were faced with either entering new markets, consolidating, or downsizing. In the five years that followed, Augustine consolidated many firms under Lockheed Martin, itself the product of the merger of Lockeed and Martin Marietta, forming the country’s largest defense firm. In 1995 the new company went public, at which point it started prioritizing stock prices and other contemporary markers of financial health. It worked: in 1997 Augustine wrote that the company’s share price had nearly doubled in two years. And yet in the process Lockheed Martin closed a quarter of its plants and laid off 100,000 workers, vastly paring down management and labor in the name of efficiency. The benefits of all this cost-cutting rarely went to the government. Nor were many of the gains reinvested in production. Lockheed Martin had become good at getting contracts; Augustine wrote in the Harvard Business Review about harnessing the “natural competitive instincts in human beings.” But the products themselves suffered: they were more expensive, slower to deliver, and of lower quality. * The state’s priorities were also changing. The Gulf War seemed to vindicate Westmoreland’s Vietnam-era dreams of an “electronic battlefield.” William Perry, soon elevated to defense secretary, became a firm believer that the US was on the cusp of a “revolution in military affairs”—the idea, as the RAND analyst Paul K. Davis has summarized it, that “technological developments sometimes make possible a qualitative change in the nature of warfare.” That conviction moved him to prioritize funding, developing, and promoting “dual-use” technologies that could be applied to both commercial and military settings. He and Clinton built closer relationships with technology firms, offering them greater access to government and policymaking.10 In the late 1990s, as the researcher Barry D. Watts notes in a 2008 report, the Pentagon encouraged defense companies to “act more like commercial firms.” Augustine was well-positioned to adapt to these conditions. He had advocated for government support for the semiconductor industry during its crisis: asking “why DoD or the government should provide support for the semiconductor industry,” he testified to the Senate in 1987, “would be much like asking at the outset of World War II why we should buy ships and airplanes because it might help the shipbuilding and the aircraft industries.” From his perch on initiatives like the Defense Science Board, he not only observed but shaped how Intel and others had navigated the changing political-economic waters; now he hoped to replicate their accomplishments. Between 1993 and 1998, as Hartung has shown, Augustine lobbied intensely—and successfully—for immense government subsidies for defense in general and the new Lockheed Martin in particular. Those subsidies came in many forms, from aid for mergers—“closing plants, relocating equipment, paying severance to laid-off workers, and providing ‘golden parachutes’ to board members and executives,” as Hartung puts it—to antitrust exemptions and subsidies for arms exports (especially to new NATO countries). “To say that Augustine is wired into the Washington policy-making process is an understatement,” Hartung noted in 1996. “For most of his career, he has been one of a handful of people drawing up the blueprints for American defense policies and deciding where the wiring should be placed.” In the 1990s companies like Intel experimented with setting up their own venture capital arms, government-backed consortia, and new institutions whose purpose was to plan and shape the markets around them. Augustine followed their lead: he and other defense industry leaders managed to insulate themselves both from democratic accountability and from the vagaries of anti-statist politics by creating experimental public institutions. In 1998 George Tenet’s CIA enlisted Augustine to help found a nonprofit venture capital firm called In-Q-Tel that gives start-ups long-term guidance and directs them to lucrative, stable government contracts. Unlike traditional VCs, In-Q-Tel claims to focus more on technology and less on profits, though over the years it seems to have helped these new companies make money more than it has helped the government acquire important technology. It was In-Q-Tel that assured the success of, among others, Palantir, Anduril, and the drone company Skydio. Augustine, who turned ninety this July, hardly ever uses words like “industrial policy” or “neoliberalism,” but in practice he and his peers became influential critics of the neoliberal turn. He has argued that, in the financialized economy, “the tax structure discourages long-term investments” and lamented that shareholders hoping for short-range profit want Lockheed Martin not to “invest in research.” Elsewhere, he has called for renewed federal funding for public education and criticized US companies for moving “much of their manufacturing capability abroad.” In an influential 2005 report called Rising Above the Gathering Storm, he and his colleagues argued that “the prosperity the United States enjoys today is due in no small part to investments the nation has made in research and development at universities, corporations, and national laboratories over the last fifty years.” The “pressures” on that sector, they warned, “could seriously erode this past success.” In such moments, Augustine sounds uncannily both like architects of Bidenomics such as Jake Sullivan and Jennifer Harris and like right-wing tech-defense figures such as Sankar, who has similarly criticized “the financialization of the defense industrial base.” There is a certain irony here: by founding In-Q-Tel and seeding a bipartisan consensus around what plagued America’s political economy, Augustine—perhaps inadvertently—helped create the coalition now hoping to displace the company he has spent much of his life running. 4. Defense stocks tanked in 1998 and 1999, and credit agencies downgraded their debt to nearly “uninvestable” levels. As the industry consolidated, firms got even bigger, more complex, and, via joint contracts, increasingly linked to one another. By 2000 they were in a delicate position. With relatively low profits and cash flow but high debt-to-equity ratios, they increasingly focused less on investing in essential R&D than on trying to grow in the short term by competing recklessly for contracts. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division A pilot operating the instrument panel of the Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Hercules cargo plane during a demonstration flight for Pentagon personnel and press over Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, 1998 Then came the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, as Hartung has shown in Prophets of War, inaugurated an industry-wide bonanza. Companies like Lockheed Martin entered new markets: “enhanced interrogation,” translation, dubiously legal surveillance. The Bush administration was full of defense monopoly affiliates, among them Secretary of the Air Force James Roche, a former vice president at Northrop Grumman; Secretary of the Navy Gordon England, a former executive at General Dynamics; and Edward Aldridge, who was a member of Lockheed Martin’s board of directors while serving on the president’s commission on space. Congress subsidized Lockheed Martin for arming new Eastern European NATO members; in 2008 US companies accounted for two thirds of the world’s new arms sales. At the same time, the DoD came to focus on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism techniques that relied heavily on information technology, like cyberwar and “network-centric warfare.” Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wanted to make “the leap into the information age” by pursuing drones and surveillance. None of this meant that the trend toward military privatization slowed. It continued apace through the Iraq War, from the US military’s contracts with mercenaries like Blackwater to private contracts for hardware. On Second Breakfast, the former Green Beret Justin McIntosh describes how outsourcing military functions to contractors during the Syrian conflict forced him into a situation not unlike The Wages of Fear: I had a truck that had a bent rod. These trucks that we’re driving around in, these MRAPs and these large RG-33s…[require] a contractor [to] come in and work on it. We were in an area where we had been shot at. I had to medically evacuate some guys. The contractors did not want to travel. They wanted me to drive this truck hundreds of kilometers to the safe base where they could then repair it. The problem, McIntosh continued, was that “we had already taken all of that capability that existed within the United States military”—for instance, the ability to repair its own equipment—and “shifted it over to the private sector. It gave them control.” * This tendency toward privatization continued through the Obama administration, during which defense officials started to fixate on reducing costs. (“The gusher has been turned off,” Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced in 2010.) Obama saw bloated defense monopolies as an obstacle to this goal. But rather than addressing the structure of the industry or its political economy, the administration focused on improving its topline numbers by switching out the supposedly corrupt, atrophied defense giants for new firms from the Democrat-friendly tech sector, which promised to replace the functions of the legacy firms more cheaply. An influential proponent of this turn was Ash Carter, whom Obama nominated as his defense secretary in 2014. Carter and his deputy, Robert Work, had a “simple but ambitious” agenda, as the anthropologist Roberto González has written: “to harness the best and brightest ideas from the tech industry for Pentagon use.”11 Carter’s emphasis would be not on training soldiers but on developing drones, automation, satellites, and other cutting-edge defense technologies sourced from Silicon Valley. Carter’s focus on unmanned tech was not exactly a break from the Bush era, but the shift to the Valley was. Fueled by experiments like In-Q-Tel, the tech-defense coalition was already looking to gain market share: in 2014, nearly a year before Carter took office, SpaceX sued the Air Force for preferring the primes; in 2016 Palantir filed a lawsuit against the Army for allegedly trying to develop internal intelligence software without adequately considering commercial options. (One of Anduril’s founders, Trae Stephens, has claimed that these lawsuits helped Anduril win defense department contracts.)12 Obama and then Trump both also expanded the department’s ability to use its “other transaction authority,” which allows the government to do business more easily with commercial entities, for example by letting it sign contracts faster and with less oversight. The defense start-ups that successfully attracted Silicon Valley financing relied on the extraordinary wealth and political lobbying connections of their founders. “Every defense company that had been founded by a billionaire was a success,” as Luckey—who sold his VR company, Oculus, to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion—noted in 2024. “I hate that we live in a country where that’s the case,” he added. “But I realized that I had a unique responsibility as one of the very few people who was willing to work on national security and blessed with the resources to actually make a real go at it.” Obama officials proved receptive to such lobbying. During his tenure Carter set up an In-Q-Tel-inspired program called Defense Innovation Unit—Experimental (DIUx), which worked closely with a new Defense Innovation Board, chaired by the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, to determine the government’s investments in emerging technology, from drones to AI. It encouraged Silicon Valley firms and funders with the promise of long-term contracts for defense tech, as well as evaluation and testing—in effect ensuring their success in advance. Carter also laid the foundations for projects that came to fruition under the first Trump administration: between 2017 and 2019 the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy all launched their own experimental institutions designed to set up tech start-ups with military contracts. Private equity and venture capital saw an opportunity to make nearly guaranteed profits off the government’s investments. Between 2021 and 2024, VCs poured $130 billion into defense. In their book Unit X (2024), two of DIUx’s early directors, Raj M. Shah and Christopher Kirchhoff, claim that by 2017 their work had excited “investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley” about working with the Pentagon by lowering “barriers to entry.” (They decline to specify which ones.) When James Mattis visited DIUx under the first Trump administration, in 2017, Shah and Kirchhoff arranged for him to have dinner with the tech investor Sam Altman (then at Y-Combinator) and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who insisted that the Valley was interested in the defense industry and implored him to support the project. Mattis was enticed by the work they were doing on drones—a later fixation of Andreessen’s. Employees at Google expressed discontent with the company’s defense contracts, organizing to block initiatives like Project Maven, a machine learning program for the Pentagon. The project was hardly promising: as Alexander Cockburn wrote last year in Harper’s, an Air Force testing unit found in 2011 that, “among numerous other deficiencies,” the drone-mounted cameras on which it relied “could not ‘readily find and identify targets,’ and its transmission rate was too slow.” But DoD funders were eager to collaborate with Silicon Valley all the same. (According to Cockburn, Amazon, Microsoft, and Palantir were among the subcontractors who joined the Maven project after Google declined to renew the contract in 2018.) Since then employers have used the threat of AI to shrink the pool of tech jobs, costing the workers leverage. By 2022 employee dissent had been largely squashed: Google and other major defense firms all but declared that they were happy to work with the military. Now executives at tech and tech-defense firms brag about joining the army reserves to help with the design and purchase of their products—an arrangement that seems rife with potential conflicts of interest. The Biden administration continued many of these Obama-Trump trends. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appointed Apple’s Doug Beck to direct DIU—as it was by now simply called—and empowered him to report directly to Austin. Congress gave the program nearly $1 billion for the 2024 financial year, and Biden awarded important hardware contracts to Palantir and Anduril. SpaceX doubled its federal contracts at the beginning of the Biden administration; they had practically doubled again by the end. In late 2022 Austin established the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) to push investment in defense-oriented small businesses and tech start-ups; under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it will have $200 billion to spend, and likely more in the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Perhaps most visibly, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks enthusiastically embraced all things tech: at a 2024 event organized by Andreessen’s VC firm, she emphasized that “moving fast and breaking things is necessary to win wars.” Nonetheless DIU’s leaders and their Silicon Valley allies felt that the Biden Department of Defense wasn’t friendly enough. By 2023, Shah and Kirchhoff complain, it still awarded most of its contracts to the primes. “It seemed as if the whole Biden team had forgotten about DIU and Silicon Valley,” they write, “even as Ukraine was aggressively deploying DIU technologies on the battlefield.” Their vision for the department is blunt: “All the Pentagon needs to do is be a great customer. Buy products, and trust that good venture capitalists will pour money into the companies building those products.” * All this support for the tech-defense sector has so far had disappointing results. A congressionally mandated report produced this year by the Government Accountability Office suggests that there were no metrics by which DIU could measure its success at actually bringing new technology into the military. The Biden defense department’s embrace of tech yielded such fruits as the “Replicator Initiative,” which committed in August 2023 to delivering “multiple thousands” of new autonomous systems in eighteen to twenty-four months. Hartung told me that many industry experts found that timeline hard to believe: no program had ever delivered products that fast. The deadline the initiative set has now passed, and his skepticism seems warranted. The initial delivery was said to be in the hundreds, and The Wall Street Journal recently reported that some of the program’s systems “have been unreliable, or were so expensive or slow to be manufactured they couldn’t be bought in the quantity needed.”For many observers, the first real test of Silicon Valley defense tech is how US-made drone technology fares in Ukraine, a war often cited as a laboratory for unmanned warfare. In a speech this past August, published in the Free Press, Luckey described going to the front lines “just a few weeks” after the full-scale Russian invasion “to train Ukrainian soldiers on advanced military technology that I had developed.” He witnessed “remarkable” feats, he said: “with drones costing just a few thousand dollars each, a handful of Ukrainian pilots remotely carpeted airstrips with explosives thousands of miles into Russia.” (He seems to have been playing fast and loose with chronology: Ukrainian drones reached hundreds of miles into Russian territory that December; it would take them still longer to reach thousands.) Drone technology has indeed been crucial to the conflict, especially more recently, as troops have been harder to come by on both sides. But a range of commentators have cautioned against assuming it therefore represents “the future of war.” Prominent defense think tanks like RUSI have warned that “overreliance on uncrewed aerial systems” has created “significant problems” for Ukraine, in part because it “plays into Russia’s strengths” at short-range air defense and other antidrone capabilities. William LaPlante, Biden’s under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, has echoed this view. “Don’t tell me it’s got AI and quantum in it. I don’t care,” he said at a 2022 conference. “The tech bros aren’t helping us too much in Ukraine…. It’s hardcore production of really serious weaponry. That’s what matters.” (Many drone companies, moreover, still rely on Chinese parts.) The subtext behind the flurry of puff pieces treating drone war as an inevitability is that a trough of money in the small-to-midsize drone market is up for grabs, over which various coalitions are starting to compete. Sean Gallup/Getty Images A soldier in a US Army platoon specializing in unmanned aircraft systems watches an Anduril Ghost-X drone landing during an exercise at the Hohenfels Training Area, Bavaria, February 3, 2025 To the extent that drones have proven essential in Ukraine, for that matter, hardware made in the US—by firms like Microsoft, Skydio, AeroVironment, and Cyberlux—has fallen short of expectations. Ukrainians have found US-produced drones “fragile and unable to overcome Russian jamming and GPS blackout technology,” The Wall Street Journal reported last year. “At times, they couldn’t take off, complete missions or return home.” Skydio recently announced that one of its controllers was vulnerable to radio interference. The trend of connecting more devices together to create an “Internet of things” often creates new vulnerabilities in turn. Anduril’s output is no exception. The defense blogger who writes under the name Secretary of Defense Rock observed in one widely shared piece that the company’s products “often amount to little more than rebranding existing technologies with a Silicon Valley gloss.” One of their much-touted anti-drone interceptors, the essay suggests, has “the same core function” as a familiar Raytheon product, “with marginal enhancements, repackaged in a sleeker design and infused with branding language that flatters venture capital expectations more than it reflects operational novelty.” Anduril continues to contend both with high costs and with certain problems in the field: “During an exercise last year in the Pacific called Project Kahuna,” according to the Journal, “drones from different manufacturers connected by Anduril’s software struggled at times to coordinate and perform tasks when out of sight from the operator.” Last month, Reuters has reported, the Army’s chief technology officer circulated a memo identifying a “very high risk” factor in Anduril’s prototype for a “next generation command and control” battlefield communications network: “We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure.” None of this should be surprising. Anduril is making moves to scale up production, claiming that it plans to open a “hyperscale manufacturing facility” in Ohio next year—but VC–funded firms don’t usually have the incentives or structure to prioritize taking on high-risk hardware projects. Often such companies focus instead on acquiring other firms in areas they’d like to enter, whose “founders” and engineers tend to quickly depart. They often make cuts for “efficiency” that produce an attractive financial picture in the short term, but damage the company in the long run. “The primary product of the defense VC strategy,” the scholar Elke Schwarz has written in a recent article, “is not a defense technology as such, but financial returns achieved through growth.” Worse still, she notes, venture capital’s “mandate for hypergrowth” means that VC-funded companies feel even more pressure than regular ones to produce exponential profits; when those companies make defense products, investors stand to reap enormous windfalls if armed conflict escalates around the world. “To get the military-industrial sector to grow fast,” Schwarz writes, “perhaps the best catalyst is war, or at least the embrace of its possibility.” Indeed, in 2023 a representative of America’s Frontier Fund, a VC firm backed by Thiel and Schmidt, told investors that if “the China/Taiwan situation happens,” or more generally “if there is a kinetic event in the Pacific,” then the fund’s investments would go up ten times “overnight.” 5. Resisting the defense-tech sector’s great man theory of history has grown all the more urgent now, as the Trump administration seems intent on placing those “great men” at the helm of the national security state and entrusting them with reindustrializing the sectors attached to it. Michael Obadal, the former Anduril senior director who is now Army under secretary, is part of a large cohort of Silicon Valley–adjacent figures in the administration: Dan Driscoll, a onetime J.D. Vance adviser with a background in private equity and venture capital, was confirmed as Army secretary13; Steve Feinberg, founder of the notorious private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which in recent years has invested heavily in defense tech, is in as deputy secretary at the Department of Defense, where he is using his experience to “restructure” the Pentagon; the retired general and venture capitalist Dan Kaine is now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Office of Science and Technology Policy is now headed by Peter Thiel’s former chief of staff; and the assistant secretary of defense for critical technologies is now Michael Dodd, also known as “the Doddfather,” an alumnus of DIU. At least until the administration’s recent announcement that it is seeking an equity stake in Lockheed Martin, the primes appeared mostly sanguine about their aspiring competitors. Congress—which tech-defense firms spend millions lobbying14—writes the yearly defense budget, and primes have historically wielded considerable power there; they still receive the bulk of defense spending. Among the legacy firms the prevailing consensus has been that the upstarts will not be able to replace them: their products, after all, are already battle tested. Even so, the defense-tech contracts are pouring in. The Golden Dome missile defense program—a $175 billion-plus redux of Israel’s Iron Dome and Reagan’s Star Wars missile defense program, which experts call just as unfeasible as it was in the Eighties—seems to be shaping up as a cash giveaway to the tech-defense right; a joint bid from SpaceX, Anduril, and Palantir is reportedly the front-runner for the contract. (Hegseth has ordered major cuts at the Pentagon testing and evaluation office that a congressional panel recently tasked with assessing the program.) Other start-ups hope to privatize hardware testing, and Palantir seems to be positioning itself to assume some of the same functions of the embattled National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. New Pentagon rules that facilitate “anything-as-a-service” contracting allow private companies to shut off or modify their products as they desire (within contractual constraints, assuming these are followed), making US arms exports considerably less appealing to other countries but allowing the companies veto power over the use of their services or weapons—and further opportunities for rent-seeking. This past May, Luckey announced that Anduril would, as 60 Minutes put it, surpass “$6 billion in government contracts worldwide” by the end of the year. “We buy a lot of things from Palantir,” Trump said at a recent White House AI summit, calling out Sankar by name. Scott Legato for Palantir Technologies/Getty Images Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar giving a keynote speech at the Inaugural Reindustrialize Conference in front of a projection of Intel cofounder Robert Noyce, Detroit, Michigan, June 26, 2024 Defense-tech executives clearly hope to take advantage of the post-Covid surge of interest in industrial policy. There has been a great deal of chatter in right-wing circles, from Oren Cass’s American Compass to the Heritage Foundation, about the prospect that the US could move from a supposedly feminized service-based economy to a masculine-coded, producerist one organized around defense manufacturing. (In April, Fox News ran the chyron “TRUMP’S MANLY TARIFFS: PUNDIT BELIEVES IT COULD REVERSE CRISIS IN MASCULINITY.”) Even institutions like the American Enterprise Institute, which have historically reviled industrial policy in any form, have jumped on board, publishing papers endorsing industrial policies of different kinds tied to “national security.” Palantir’s leaders have echoed this rhetoric for their own purposes: Sankar lamented on The Merge that the best minds have gone into fields like ad-tech rather than defense engineering; Karp has declared that US industry has degenerated in the past fifty years to focus on “the consumer market” rather than using technology to “address challenges of industrial and national significance.” Trump himself seems to alternately contradict and endorse this agenda. He has been especially critical of CHIPS, accusing it of offering companies money they didn’t need and requiring them to hire “woke people” that hampered their success; at a recent AI summit he encouraged “all American companies to join us in rejecting poisonous Marxism in our technology.” It is as if he thinks that chip manufacturing can be brought back to the US through permitting reform and tariffs alone. Appalling immigration raids like the recent one on a Hyundai factory in Georgia have conflicted with the administration’s aim to learn from foreign expertise, producing extreme international backlash. Most recently, under Feinberg’s aegis at the DoD, the administration has pioneered an entirely new form of statecraft: running the Pentagon like a private equity firm. In the past two months the government has made a slew of one-off deals with companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and a rare earth mineral company called MP Materials. At the center of some of these agreements is a novel reading of the Defense Production Act, which the Senate Armed Services Committee is trying to formalize via a new provision allowing the government to make equity purchases in private firms. The provision has yet to pass—which has not stopped the administration from going ahead anyway. The MP Materials agreement is instructive. Feinberg, no stranger to investing in the defense world, reportedly negotiated the deal, which includes a provision to buy magnets from the company despite the fact that they only started manufacturing magnets last year. By offering a price floor and production guarantees, the Department of Defense made it possible for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to finance the issuance of equity in the firm—at which point, seemingly for the first time in US history, the DoD itself bought enough equity to become the company’s largest single shareholder and provided a $150 million loan for the company’s California mine.15 Each of these deals works a bit differently. CHIPS had promised Intel $11 billion on the condition that it met certain milestones, including building an arguably unnecessary Ohio megafactory; when the firm appeared unlikely to meet those conditions, the Trump administration exchanged the remaining money for roughly 10 percent equity in the company. With AMD and NVIDIA, the mechanism looked more like a straightforward shakedown: Trump announced that if NVIDIA wants to continue selling AI chips to China, it has to fork over 15 percent of the profits. These moves hardly amount to a real industrial strategy. One-off coercive deals with individual companies already seem unlikely to reindustrialize the country, and it remains unclear what the administration will do with its new assets. But that outcome seems even less plausible as the Trump administration takes a sledgehammer to the government’s capacity, oversight, and industrial policy. In a mere nine months the administration has destroyed the infrastructure of research and development on which the semiconductor industry and many others rely; done its best to “get rid of” the “horrible, horrible” CHIPS Act, including the new research infrastructure it created; threatened to arbitrarily revoke awards and enacted swiftly changing tariffs that damage industries; behaved so erratically toward the US’s longtime allies that the EU and others have started looking elsewhere to buy weapons; erased the nonpartisan image on which the military depends for its continued funding and ability to operate; decimated the Pentagon’s civilian staff; devastated green industries while simultaneously promising to drive the price of oil so far down that the industry believes it will cause significant bankruptcies; and curtailed the Department of Defense’s product testing, among much else. None of the defense-tech firms that praise industrial policy in theory have launched any serious public protest against these decisions. The more contracts they get, meanwhile, the more government resources they will siphon away from investing in fields—like climate technologies, welfare, or alternatives to plastics—that would benefit the US’s economy or security. Bigger tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, and Google have, for their part, also moved much closer to the Trump administration. They seem indifferent about the destruction of the infrastructures of research and support upon which they previously relied, perhaps because they believe they can hire researchers on a mercenary basis, outsource research and development to AI, or replace government functions with private ones—a doubtful prospect, since the government’s function as a neutral evaluator and standard-setter seems impossible to replace.16 The practical problem with this vision, to say nothing of its moral and ethical failings, is that it can only deal with the short term. “We love disruption,” Karp said during the company’s quarterly earnings call in February. “Disruption, at the end of the day, exposes things that aren’t working. There will be ups and downs. There’s a revolution. Some people are going to get their heads cut off. We’re expecting to see really unexpected things and to win.” Tech companies and venture-capital firms have become experts at leveraging this sort of “disruption” to generate value for their shareholders on the basis of imagined future profits, and firms like Palantir and Anduril are no exception. But now they have become so voracious, so all-consuming, that they are putting the country’s productive industries at risk. In the process, they threaten to destroy not just the source of their own profits but the spending and investment that lie at the foundation of the US economy.

Title: Is JioBlackRock Flexi Cap worth a bite?

The scheme comes after a set of passive launches earlier in the year. With this fund, the asset manager enters the well-established flexi-cap category which already has 40+ options and manages nearly ₹5 lakh crore in assets. JioBlackRock fund’s distinct proposition is that it will be managed using a rules-based, technology-led approach rather than a purely discretionary style. At the core of the design is BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) framework. It combines human expertise with data-driven models and draws from a wide universe of about 750 Indian stocks, narrowed down from more than 1,000 using liquidity, turnover, and execution feasibility filters. Each stock is scored on the basis of signals (over 400 of them specific to India) covering fundamentals, market behaviour, and alternative data. The models appear to be refreshed weekly. A benchmark-aware risk process is meant to keep deviations controlled vis-a-vis Nifty 500 Total Return Index whose current top holdings include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, RIL, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, L&T, ITC, TCS and SBI. The fund’s aim will be to deliver consistent long-term alpha while managing volatility. For perspective, flexi-cap funds as a category have a three-year monthly standard deviation of 3.7 per cent and a Sortino ratio of 0.25, according to ACEMF. The technology backbone is BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, which is widely used by global institutions for portfolio risk analytics, transaction cost modelling, and compliance. In principle, this could provide the fund managers with an advantage in managing costs and risks at scale. Another selling point is that a systematic approach can reduce behavioural biases that affect human decision-making, such as overconfidence or recency. On the investor-facing side, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund has several interesting features. It has no exit load, unlike many equity funds that impose a fee for exits within a year (0.10-1 per cent). The indicative total expense ratio for the direct plan is 0.5 per cent, placing it in the 1st quartile (lowest cost group) basis direct plan offerings. Fund managers Tanvi Kacheria and Sahil Chaudhary bring experience in quantitative and index portfolio management. India’s equity market has expanded significantly in recent years, with higher trading volumes, broader sector representation, and more IPOs adding to the listed universe. A larger opportunity set makes systematic strategies easier to apply. That said, the gaps are clear. As an NFO, there is no live performance record. The back-tested numbers shown in the presentation are hypothetical and cannot substitute for real-world data. Investors should also be aware that regular rebalancing, while intended to capture opportunities quickly, could increase churn and costs if not managed tightly. Flexi-cap funds are designed to provide long-term growth by giving managers the freedom to invest across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks without restriction. They can suit investors who want equity exposure but prefer to leave the market-cap allocation decisions to professionals. The flexi-cap space already has proven schemes with long track records. On average, existing actively managed funds in the category have delivered about 16.9 per cent CAGR over three years and 20.9 per cent over five years, broadly in line with the Nifty 500 TRI’s returns of 16.9 per cent and 20.8 per cent over the same periods. Fund portfolios are typically tilted towards large-caps (57 per cent), with decent allocations to mid-caps (20 per cent) and small-caps (17 per cent). Investors will need to weigh whether an untested quant-driven offering is worth adding alongside established names. Overall, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund represents an ambitious attempt to bring systematic active investing into India’s retail mutual fund space. Its differentiators are breadth of stock coverage, use of alternative data and AI, governance filters, and lower cost. The risks are the lack of a live record and dependence on models that may behave differently in stressed conditions. Also, small bets across a large number of stocks to beat Nifty 500 may result in a very diffused portfolio. For investors seeking core flexi-cap exposure, established funds remain more reliable choices. JioBlackRock Flexi Cap may be tracked as an option for satellite allocation once it builds a live record. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings’ current preferred choices include HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, and Franklin India Flexi Cap Fund.

Title: As stock market booms, Americans have more at stake than ever
URL: https://www.inquirer.com/business/stock-market-economy-investors-ai-wall-street-20251004.html
Time Published: 2025-10-04T09:13:40Z
Full Content:
Small investors are riding a wave, even as Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture and some analysts think the market is overheated. Americans have a greater share of their resources in the stock market than ever before, driving a historic accumulation of wealth that also leaves more individual investors exposed to the market’s ups and downs. That expansion comes as stocks march steadily upward in defiance of increasingly worrisome economic data. The S&P 500 index rose about 7% in the third quarter that ended Tuesday, led by artificial-intelligence-related investments that some believe are primed for a correction. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that households and nonprofits were investing about 45.4% of their assets in corporate equities as of the second quarter of 2025 — the highest exposure to stocks ever. An estimated 62% of Americans own stock as of May, matching 2024 and the highest level since 2007, according to the polling firm Gallup. And Federal Reserve data analyzed by the Securities and Exchange Commission shows the median U.S. household had about $52,000 in stock holdings as of 2022, compared with nearly $46,000 in 2019. Analysts say there are myriad reasons for this trend line; trading apps such as Robinhood and Webull have made it easier to invest small amounts of money in companies and index funds. It also explains the rise in meme stocks — shares of a company that go viral by way of social media sites such as Reddit. The expansion of 401(k) accounts, spurred by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, means more workers are automatically enrolled in retirement plans that include stocks and bonds. The stock surge has created an influx of millionaires, according to Fidelity Investments, one of the largest administrators of workplace retirement plans. Fidelity had 595,000 accounts with balances in excess of $1 million at the end of the second quarter, up nearly 20% year over year. Personal finance experts also point to the role of emotions in setting investment trends. The spectacular stock market gains of 2020 and 2021 have also led to a sense of FOMO — fear of missing out — as people want to position themselves for the next rally, said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. “We’ve also enjoyed a fairly strong economy for a decade-plus, and economic expansion tends to give households more leeway in their budgets to invest for the long term, and more confidence to do so,” Benz said. Meanwhile, Wall Street looked past the looming government shutdown on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 closing out the last day of the third quarter with a 0.4% gain; the index is now up 13.7% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed more than 9% since the start of 2025, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has soared 17.3%. And the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies is up 9.3% for the year. The third quarter has historically been “the most challenging quarter of the year,” notes CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall, who closely tracks the stock market’s historic performance. October, by comparison, has been associated with a number of volatile “shakeout events,” Stovall said, possibly because it coincides with the end of the fiscal year for many mutual funds, meaning fund managers often adjust their portfolios. Historically, “there is more rain in September, but more wind in October,” Stovall said. Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture. Inflation ticked up to 2.9% in August to the fastest pace since January, fueling stagflation worries. Though unemployment remains relatively low, at 4.3%, U.S. employers created far fewer positions during much of 2024 and the early part of 2025 than previously reported, according to recent federal data. Analysts say the most recent market gains got a nudge from the Federal Reserve, which lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter-point on Sept. 17, citing a cooling labor market. That should mean lower borrowing costs for Americans looking to buy homes or wanting to start or grow businesses. Falling rates could help companies reduce debt or invest more in their operations. But any development that affects the Fed’s plans — such as an unexpectedly high inflation reading or new tariffs — could spook the markets, said Michael Farr, an analyst with the D.C.-based Farr, Miller & Washington. “What happens if tariff inflation shows up and the Fed says, ‘Wait a minute’? We’re already moving into the thin branches of risk, solely based on these price levels,” Farr said. As a result, Farr said, investing in 2025 is “anything but a no-brainer,” because buying into the stock market means paying for stocks at near-record prices. “Stock ownership means that you own a small piece of corporate America,” Farr said. “While you never want to bet against corporate America, you never want to pay the highest price anyone has ever paid.” The market has been buoyed by continued enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, with big tech companies including Oracle, Palantir, and Meta driving a significant share of the market’s gains. Investors could be at risk if the new technology fails to deliver returns that are commensurate with the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, energy, and other aspects of AI infrastructure. And some analysts believe AI stocks are overvalued, creating the risk of a bubble. A recent order making it easier for everyday savers to invest retirement funds in alternative assets such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies could further increase risks for investors, said Corey Frayer, of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America. Still, analysts cautioned that the most successful investors tend to keep a longtime horizon and avoid overreacting in the short term. “The biggest risk is that, if we have a sell-off, these newer investors could cash out at the bottom,” said Wayne Wicker, president of McLean, Va.-based Opal Capital. “Markets can go a lot further with rich valuations than most people expect.”

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from Xbox Game Pass' price hike to foldable iPhone teasers

Here's your firmware update for October 4, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week has rounded off September, or Tech-tember as we call it, with the last few events of the month, from Amazon to Google's big hardware and software reveals. We also watched the internet implode as Xbox Game Pass got a major price hike, leading many to question if the subscription is still a good deal for them. To catch up on all of this and more, scroll down for our recap of the week's seven biggest tech news stories. For ICYMI, we don’t normally include reports based on leaks and speculation, as while they can be right on the money, they can also be way off the mark – even from often reliable sources. We’re making an exception here as Samsung Display’s president Lee Cheong has said that the company is preparing to mass produce foldable phone panels for a North American client, and only one company comes to mind as this mysterious buyer: Apple. That’s because the long-awaited foldable iPhone is rumored to be launching next year, and Samsung Display has long been making its other iPhone screens. We’ve heard numerous rumors about what the foldable iPhone might look like, but expect something thin – it might even be thinner than the 5.6mm iPhone Air when unfolded. Pricing-wise, the most recent leaked price we’ve heard is $1,999 (around £1,500 / AU$3,050). The much-hyped Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are finally available to the public in the US, and you can even book a demo to give them a whirl. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This wearable is essentially Meta’s existing Ray-Ban smart glasses with a screen attached, offering additional functionality such as on-screen navigation, notification pop-ups, and even support for video calls. But with pairs starting at $799, you probably want to try them before you buy them. That’s why, using Meta’s official scheduler page, you can find a retailer near you offering 25-minute demos. Just be prepared to wait a while, as demos are already booked up for months – although as more stores offer the specs and roll them out to more regions, it should become easier to book a demo slot. Tilly Norwood is an AI ‘actress’ from “the world’s first artificial intelligence (AI) talent studio,” Xicoia, and she burst onto the scene via social media to look for agent representation. The creator asked folks to “judge her by merit,” but we and many others – especially notable Hollywood figures – have decided she’s a terrifying prospect for the world of entertainment that could remove humanity from upcoming shows and films. At these times, we can't help thinking of that viral quote from Joanna Maciejewska when it comes to the likes of Tilly Norwood: "I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes." If you use Meta AI’s chatbot on Facebook and Instagram, you might want to reconsider, as beginning December 16, your chats will influence the ads you see – and at the time of writing, you can’t opt out. "For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page. As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots," Meta explained in its announcement. Meta may be a pioneer here, but Google has discussed showing ads in Gemini and its AI Overviews, which appear at the top of search, while Amazon is using conversations with its Rufus AI chatbot for similar purposes. On Tuesday, Amazon held a huge hardware event in New York, and we were right there in the audience, bringing you the full lowdown on every device as it was announced. Some of the highlights included the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which feels just like writing on paper, integrates with OneDrive and Google Docs, new Echo smart speakers and smart displays, three new Fire TVs, and updated Ring cameras and doorbells. Everything is infused with AI courtesy of Alexa+, and we were able to get our hands (and ears) on everything to bring you our first impressions as soon as the presentations were over. Google’s smart home tech is finally set to get the much-anticipated Gemini update, which will bring more conversational interactions, improved assistance for setting up your automations, and better object detection for your smart cameras. Unfortunately, for the best features, you’ll need to start paying for a Google Home Premium subscription – yours for $10 a month or $100 a year (the Standard tier), or $20 a month or $200 a year (the Advanced tier). The good news is you won’t need to upgrade to the new Google Home Speaker (though you can if you want), as the update will be supported by all of Google’s home tech launched in the last decade. Microsoft set the internet on fire by announcing big changes coming to Xbox Game Pass. That is that a top-tier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription now costs $29.99 / £22.99 / AU$35.95. This means that a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – at $359.88 – costs only a little less than an Xbox Series S – with its recently increased $379.99 price. Now, Ultimate does come with some useful benefits. It now includes a Fortnite Crew membership (which nets you skins, 1,000 V-Bucks per month, and the Battle Pass), Ubisoft+ Classics (curated classic Ubisoft games), and shorter wait times and 1440p resolution when streaming. That said, many gamers haven’t taken this news well, with the page players would use to cancel their subscriptions crashing. Yikes! Don’t worry completely about the price rise, as you can still get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99 per month for now – while stock lasts.

Title: Sea views on Dublin Bay’s south side to go if planned flood walls for Dart line are built
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/climate-crisis/2025/10/04/sea-views-on-dublin-bays-south-side-to-go-if-planned-flood-walls-for-dart-line-are-built/

Plans for new flood defences along the Dart line in south Dublin will replace household sea views with concrete walls, residents have learned. They say the plan will also kill off hopes for a long-promised walking and cycling path along Dublin Bay. Irish Rail says the work is vital to protect the rail line from rising sea levels, intensifying storms and heavier rainfall, but local people are appealing for a rethink. “If this goes ahead, there will be a lot of saddened people,” Marie Baker, a Fine Gael councillor for the area said. The new defences would run for 4km from Merrion Gates to Seapoint – one of five stretches of rail line prioritised for works under the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Projects scheme (ECRIPP). [ Rising sea levels, more storm surges and shifting weather patterns put properties at riskOpens in new window ] They would be built of concrete on top of the existing stone walls, adding 1.3 metres to the height on average. Some glass would be installed at stations along the route to preserve views for waiting passengers, but Irish Rail said it was not possible to use it more extensively. “Flood glass, on its own, is unable to withstand the size of wave and storm loads we expect to experience by 2075, for which we are designing these interventions,” a spokeswoman said. Ms Baker said the loss of views was no trivial issue, as the connection with the sea defined the character of the whole area. She said she had suggested installing storm drains and attenuation tanks to quickly drain and hold flood waters, and hoped this might still be considered. “I don’t think people realise the extent of what is planned. We needed better drawings from Irish Rail to show what it looks like now and what it will look like when they do what they’re planning as a comparison. “If you’re sitting on the Dart, you’re not going to see a thing. I’m not denying we need to do something, but we need to look more at this proposal.” Retired architect Michael Collins said the proposal would end hopes of completing the Sutton to Sandycove (StoS) walking and cycling path. The northern half from Sutton to the Dublin Docklands has been completed, but the southern half has not progressed. “StoS would not only provide a tremendous amenity but it would actually solve the flooding problem,” Mr Collins said. He said a continuous promenade on the seaward side of the rail line, bounded by a wall of moderate height and bolstered by rock armour, would block the waves and allow any overtopping to spill on to the path, saving the tracks and the views. [ Areas on Dublin’s northside among most at-risk from ‘extreme coastal events’Opens in new window ] He said the additional cost could be offset by savings from an Eirgrid plan to lay a high voltage cable from Blackrock to Poolbeg, by running it out into the bay and back. “Eirgrid could lay the cable under the promenade, which would cut the length in half and save an awful lot of money,” Mr Collins said. “We have a solution that works for everyone, and it’s very frustrating when agencies don’t work together for the common good.” Irish Rail said flood defences outside the existing walls were considered, but were ruled out because of the expected impact on protected habitats. Special dispensation from Europe would be needed, and this could significantly delay the project, it said. “The works proposed in these areas would not preclude a walk or cycleway seaward of the rail boundary being delivered in future by a body responsible for active travel,” it added. However, it said these too would likely need permission from Europe. ECRIPP is open for public consultation and submissions until October 13th.

Title: Stripe Unveils Stablecoin Issuance Tool With Phantom’s CASH, Expands Into AI Commerce with OpenAI

Editor Crypto Coin Desk, Krisztian Sandor With Open Issuance and AI payment standards, Stripe is doubling down on its bet on the rising role of blockchain and digital agents in payments. Payments giant Stripe unveiled a stablecoin issuance platform and AI commerce tools at its New York showcase on Tuesday, marking a push to tie its payments business to the growing role of digital dollars and artificial intelligence in online transactions. Open Issuance, underpinned by stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion last year, enables firms to launch their own stablecoins, minting and redeeming tokens with just a few lines of code. Phantom’s CASH token, an open-loop stablecoin by the popular crypto wallet provider, will be the first to debut through Open Issuance, the firm announced. The recently-launched stablecoins of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid’s USDH and MetaMask’s mUSD will also be issued through the protocol, with more projects already in the pipeline, the firm said. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don’t build on top of someone else’s coin,” Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. “With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” Issuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs. The AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard. These product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale. “With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy,” Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on “pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream.” Read more: Why Circle and Stripe (And Many Others) Are Launching Their Own Blockchains Crypto Crypto Crypto

Dear friends, Welcome to the October issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. And welcome to the Dog Days of Autumn! The natural world is scrambling to keep up with the changes we’ve triggered, and continue to intensify, upon it. As I walked one of the many bike/hike trails in the Quad Cities on Sunday, I confronted two worlds. One was defined by 90-degree temperatures, hot sunshine, and cracked earth. The other by the rhythm of birds called southward and plants quietening for the season to come, ready for the renewal that heralds the spring. Some plants need the signal of darkness to trigger their autumnal bloom. The mums in our south garden once attended my mum’s funeral; today, they celebrate, triggered by the lengthening night. A sort of “geez, it’s getting dark around here, I better get my butt moving” response. I wonder if we might take inspiration from them? Common milkweed, the Augustana College Quad, late September 2025 Our colleague Lynn Bolin addresses portfolio construction for uncertain times with two complementary October pieces. In “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control,” he presents a ten-fund “all-weather” strategy targeting 8% returns with 12% maximum drawdown, emphasizing Alternative Global Macro, Alternative Multi-Strategy, and globally diversified funds. Drawing on Rob Dix’s The Price of Money and Kenneth Rogoff’s Our Dollar, Your Problem, Bolin argues that Quantitative Easing inflated asset prices, while current high valuations suggest below-average future U.S. stock returns, leading him toward funds like FPA Flexible Fixed Income (FPFIX), PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX), and BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX). His companion article, “Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios,” explores hedges against what Dix and Rogoff predict will be “more frequent bouts of inflation” and financial instability. While gold has soared past $3,750, Bolin seeks lower-volatility alternatives, comparing funds like AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) and Frost Credit (FCFAX) against his target portfolio. Though Lynn is not expecting 1970s-style stagflation imminently, he’s adding fifty funds to his evaluation system for potential portfolio modifications, balancing inflation protection with his conservative risk tolerance. Stay tuned! We had an unusual wealth of fund launches to report on, resulting in two Launch Alerts and one not-quite-Launch-Alert. Tweedy, Browne International Insider + Value ETF launched on September 10, 2025. It is active, quantitative, and research-driven. It works from two assumptions, which are corroborated by a lot of evidence. You should: If the folks in the know are pouring money into stocks you’ve identified as undervalued, that’s a powerful confirmation. It has worked well with its sibling, Tweedy, Browne Insider + Value ETF, which launched in 2024, falls in the mid-cap value box, and is up 23% YTD. RACWI US ETF launched on September 11, 2025, and is Research Affiliates’ permutation of an S&P 500 index fund. Here’s the tweak: RAFI starts with the question, “Should these firms even belong in the investable universe?” They answer that question by looking at corporate fundamentals (do they make money?) and then excluding companies that are failing, without regard to their stock price. Currently, they exclude about 25 of the S&P 500 companies, but then market-cap-weight the remainder just as the S&P does. The Militia Long/Short ETF is the not-quite-a-Launch-Alert. Launch Alerts target funds launched in roughly the past 6-8 weeks, while Militia launched in January 2025. We wanted to put it on your radar because Sam Lee, former Morningstar editor and strategist, founder of SVRN Asset Management, former MFO contributor, and a remarkably smart guy, wanted to put it on ours. Finally, The Shadow reports on the industry’s latest tribulations, including T. Rowe Price’s decision to liquidate its once-promising T. Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund, a bunch of funds deciding they’d rather go to the ETF dance, and Dodge & Cox triggering three sets of share splits. The conversion story took a twist in early October with the SEC’s imminent announcement of a decision to permit ETF share classes of mutual funds. That means that you might be able to choose either the Fidelity Low Priced Stock fund’s no-load retail share class or the same fund’s ETF share class. According to Morningstar, at least 75 fund firms have lined up to create ETF shares of their existing funds, which might well blunt the incentive for the fund-to-ETF conversions that have proliferated in the past year or two. Geoff Colvin, senior editor-at-large at Fortune, made two useful observations in late September: His simple statement that stocks are highly valued is indisputable. Most measures are screaming that the S&P is insanely overpriced. The Shiller Cyclically Adjusted Price/Earnings ratio is the highest it has been since the dotcom peak. The price-to-sales ratio hit a new all-time high this week. The Buffett Indicator—ratio of the market’s capitalization to GDP—says stocks are highly overvalued, and Warren Buffett is holding an enormous cash cache because he can’t find bargains. But also: Greenspan gave his [Irrational Exuberance] speech in December 1996—almost four years before the market plunge. As he told Fortune years later, “If you had left the market when I gave my irrational exuberance speech, you would have missed another 80% of increase” in stock values. (Actually, it was closer to 100%.) (“Back in the ’90s a Fed chief warned about ‘irrational exuberance’ in the markets. Stocks rose 105% over the next 4 years,” Fortune, 9/30/2025) CNN notes the same anomaly: “Hiring is at a standstill. Inflation is on the rise again. Consumer sentiment is slipping near historic lows. Americans are increasingly fed up with the economy” (“Why are stocks setting records when the economy feels down in the dumps?” CNN, 9/15/2025). Satya Pradhuman, once the chief small cap strategist at Merrill Lynch and now director of research at Cirrus Research, claims that the market is already in crazy-land: “The melt-up of risk-taking in U.S. equities has pierced the upper boundaries of a normalized range. A combination of a very crowded equity market, combined with an extreme risk appetite, places the U.S. equity market into an overtly speculative chapter” (“Stock market’s relentless rally threatens to turn into a ‘melt-up’,” via Dow Jones, 9/13/2025). Quartz reports, “Wall Street’s penny aisle is back in business. More than 90 companies — including a Hong Kong noodle shop and a smattering of obscure startups — have floated IPOs this year at $5 a share, the highest number since the Regan years. Penny stocks’ comeback has less to do with solid fundamentals than it does with commission-free apps that turn speculation into a swipe, crypto-fueled investors chasing the next moonshot, and a regulatory spotlight that has wandered elsewhere. For retail traders shut out of $4 trillion tech titans and six-figure Bitcoin, penny stocks offer a cheap thrill: thousands of shares for less than the price of a single iPhone” (Quartz Daily Brief, 9/25/2025). On the day I write this (a) the federal government shut down, (b) the jobs report from ADP was disastrous, and (c) the stock market went up. The federal response has been “to boldly implement” Trump’s order to get alternative assets into retirement plans (Department of Labor News Release, 9/23/2025), while FINRA moved to relax the rules surrounding day-trading, so both retirement and non-retirement investors can treat their portfolios like a roulette wheel! Whee? The key to all of this is the willingness of the American consumer (aka “you”) to continue having confidence in Mr. Trump’s steady hand on the tiller, which leads you to continue buying more and more stuff, relying on more and more debt (currently a record $18.4 trillion) to do so. And the level of stock ownership is now at a record high; almost 45% of Americans’ net wealth rests in their stock portfolios (Federal Reserve data, 9/28/2025). So the American consumer is propping up the stock market, and the stock market is propping up the economy, and now consumer confidence is cratering. Will there be a devastating market crash? Yep. Soon? Maybe. Maybe not. What’s an investor to do? The same as always, dear friends. Act before the storm, not during it. Find an asset allocation (mine, as readers now, is 25/25/25/25) that will likely produce the returns you need to meet your goals with a level of volatility that allows you to continue enjoying life and sleeping regularly. Our recommendation has always been to look for managers who earn their keep and your trust: they have an enormous dislike of losing your money, they’re fully invested with you, they speak sensibly, and have a record of success across friendly and hostile markets. Do not ever sit at the same table with someone who preens and struts and talks about beating the market; they’re fools and potentially contagious. The goal is not to “beat the market,” it’s to live a good life and then move on. Jonathan Clements, who died this week of cancer at 62, was that rarest of financial journalists: someone the industry couldn’t buy, couldn’t charm, and couldn’t seduce into softening his message. For nearly two decades at The Wall Street Journal and later as founder of Humble Dollar, he wielded his pen like a scalpel, cutting away the jargon, the self-serving studies, and the expensive nonsense that Wall Street had convinced investors was gospel. Jonathan Clements and I corresponded once, around the launch of Humble Dollar. He was amiably cool from my perspective, which I expected and respected. I invited him to add his voice to Mutual Fund Observer when it called to him, but he had other plans and, as it turned out, far greater success. Clements’s prescription was elegant in its simplicity: eliminate human agency wherever possible, invest in broad market index funds, keep costs ruthlessly low, and refuse to believe that anyone, whether broker, advisor, or fund manager, could consistently beat the market. He had the data on his side, the integrity to say it plainly, and the courage to sustain a “nonstop blizzard of complaint and criticism” from an industry that hated what he wrote. MFO pursued a different path. I’ve argued for considering small, boutique managers whose strategies made sense and whose understanding of themselves as “risk managers” rather than “return managers” was deeply ingrained. I believe that thoughtful human judgment, properly applied and fairly compensated, can add value for investors willing to do their homework, most especially in turbulent markets. Jonathan would have seen this as precisely the kind of thinking he spent his career arguing against. And he wouldn’t have been entirely wrong to be skeptical. But here’s what mattered more than our tactical disagreement: we shared an absolute commitment to helping people achieve financial security in the face of forces designed to enrich an industry at the expense of those it claimed to serve. Clements and I arrived at different answers, but we were working on the same problem, and we were both trying to solve it honestly. That honesty was Clements’s defining characteristic. Jason Zweig noted that in over 1,000 columns, Jonathan “never once, to the best of my knowledge, wrote anything that was flagrantly wrong. He never misled or fibbed, or lied to his readers.” In an industry built on obfuscation, that record is astonishing. But what strikes me most, reading the tributes from those who knew him, is how Clements understood that money was never the point. Money was a tool for building relationships, for creating experiences with family and friends, for making a difference, and for achieving peace of mind. He wrote about raising financially responsible children. He mocked the industry’s obsession with accumulating possessions rather than celebrating meaningful experiences (which is not the same as “selfies”). And in his final year, he wrote with grace and humor about his own dying, making space for others to talk about what we’re all moving toward and helping them feel less alone. “To philosophize is to learn to die,” wrote Montaigne (with thanks to Jason Zweig for the reminder of Montaigne’s words). Jonathan Clements spent his career teaching people how to live, how to use money as a means rather than an end, how to see through the fog, how to protect themselves and their families from predation dressed up as advice. And then, at the end, he taught us how to face death with laughter and courage and generosity. The financial services industry will not mourn him. But millions of investors who achieved comfortable retirements because of his clear, consistent, principled guidance will remember him with gratitude. Those of us who disagreed with some of his investment philosophy can still honor the integrity with which he held and expressed it. In a field that rewards complexity, obfuscation, and self-interest, Jonathan Clements chose clarity, honesty, and service. The example matters more than the investment strategy. Rest in peace, Mr. Clements. You fought the good fight. After a small struggle to get their shareholders to endorse or reject a proposal to make AKREX the largest-ever fund-to-ETF conversion. A majority of shareholders finally voted in September to endorse the change. The upcoming benchmarks: October 10, 2025, the retail ARKEX shares merge with the institutional AKRIX ones October 24, AKRIX-the-fund becomes AKRE-the-ETF October 27, ARKE begins trading on the NYSE While Akre shareholders were considering, BlackRock moved to swiftly convert two funds into active ETFs: the BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity Fund and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity Fund. The new ETF names are iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF (BDYN) and iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF (BDVL). Both are managed by a Global Allocation team headed by the firm’s CIO, Rick Rieder. Both are three-star funds. Since both are part of BlackRock’s “managed portfolio” business, I suspect that the conversion was made to simplify their use for that program. Before signing off and getting back to the work you rely on, we want to take a moment to pause and express our deepest gratitude to the readers who truly keep this project alive: our incredible donors. The messages and the money you send are a profound source of encouragement, and they ensure we can keep the lights on (the server lights in this case). To our bedrock supporters, Greg, William, S & F Advisors, William, Stephen, Wilson, Brian, David, Doug, Altaf: Thank you. We are genuinely humbled by your ongoing commitment. And, to Fred, John, and David who sent donations this month: Thank you for the wonderful lift. Your gifts are an immediate vote of confidence and a powerful reminder that this community is full of people who value the work we do. I’m utterly diffident about encouraging folks to contribute to the Observer when there are so many pressing needs to address: serious, adult journalism is struggling to find readers willing to pay for reliable information, food banks are being drained at an alarming rate, conservation groups are desperately trying to compensate for the insanity that’s gripped the executive branch, and so on. Here’s our recommendation: Go do good. Don’t talk about doing it. Do it. Do something. That has two benefits: (1) it steadies you—action is the antidote to despair—and (2) it helps a beleaguered world.

Title: Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios

Gold is considered one of the best hedges against inflation and uncertainty. Gold fell from about $385 in 1995 to a low of around $250 by 2001, to a high of $1,750 in 2011 before falling to $1060 in 2015. It is now over $3,750. For the past ten years, iShares Gold Trust (IAU) has had a total return of 195% compared to 289% for Vanguard 500 Index ETF (VOO). In this article, I compare funds with lower volatility than stocks and gold to protect from inflation. Preparing for inflation should be part of an overall strategy and not just timing the market when inflation rises. Most of my career was in the precious metals industry on the technical side. It was a stable industry to be in during the financial crisis, but stressful when gold tumbled. Recently, the price of gold has increased significantly due in large part to central banks buying gold, the weaker dollar, geopolitical risk, economic uncertainty, falling interest rates, and inflation. The price of gold and stocks of gold miners have risen so fast, I don’t consider either category appropriate for my conservative, low-turnover portfolio in retirement. Tariffs are making the headlines for increasing inflation. Core inflation has risen from 2.3% in April to 2.9% in August. New tariffs were just added for heavy trucks, drugs, and kitchen cabinets. Economists in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Third Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters estimate that headline CPI inflation will begin to fall from third-quarter levels, but the rules keep changing. The Federal Reserve is now lowering short-term rates to stimulate employment at the risk of aggravating inflation. Keep in mind that inflation is the change in price levels, so the increase from tariffs will be a temporary bump in inflation to a “permanently” higher price level. In addition to tariffs, the value of the dollar has fallen by eleven percent this year. As inflation increases, the purchasing power of the dollar decreases. The falling value of the dollar raises the price of imports while making U.S. exports less expensive. The falling dollar hurts investments in U.S. held by foreigners who finance part of the national debt. The cost of buying a dollar of earnings of the S&P 500 is now $30 per dollar of earnings. It is known as the price-to-earnings ratio and has doubled since 2010. I recently read The Price of Money by Rob Dix, who suggests that we may be in for a period of higher inflation and lower interest rates. I also finished reading “Our Dollar, Your Problem” by Kenneth Rogoff, in which he expects “a sustained period of global financial volatility marked by higher average real interest rates and inflation and more frequent bouts of debt and financial crises.” The reasons have a lot to do with the burden of rising national debt and how it is financed, along with the decline of the dominance of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. I am more concerned about long-term inflation as described by Rob Dix and Kenneth Rogoff; tariffs may play a role. Mr. Dix explained that Quantitative Easing was not highly effective for raising inflation to the Federal Reserve target of 2% initially because the money went into the financial system and largely resulted in inflating asset prices such as stocks. QE was more effective following the COVID recession because it increased the money available to the Treasury to create stimulus for the consumer. Along with disruptions to the supply chain from COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation rose to levels not seen since the 1970s. Figure #1 captures the annual inflation rate of the personal consumption expenditures price index and the Federal Funds rate, which is the rate at which commercial banks lend to other banks overnight. The COVID bear market occurred in 2020, inflation rose dramatically in 2021, and the Federal Funds rate was raised to slow inflation in 2022. My analysis of fund performance in this article focuses to a large extent on 2021. Figure #1: Federal Funds Rate and PCE Year-Over-Year Inflation Source: Author using St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. Wolf Richter discusses mortgage rates being between 6% to 7% following a large increase in home prices after the COVID recession in Longer-Term Treasury Yields & Mortgage Rates Jump after Rate Cut, Yield Curve Steepens, Bond Market Gets Edgy on Wolf Street: “But that’s a bubble-pricing problem now that should have never occurred, not a rate problem. The rates are fine. They’re historically at the low end of the normal range. The 5% and below mortgage rates were a creature of massive QE during the Financial Crisis and after, when the Fed loaded up on trillions of dollars of Treasury securities and MBS to push down long-term rates. But the Fed has been doing the opposite since the second half of 2022 and has shed $2.4 trillion of those securities as QT continues.” The Federal Reserve has been gradually unwinding its balance sheet when the economy and markets are strong. I expect the long end of the yield curve to stay higher for longer because of the high national debt, specter of inflation, unwinding of Quantitative Easing, and rising geopolitical risks. Federal Reserve independence is gradually being eroded. The Federal Reserve is lowering short-term rates, and a coordinated effort by the Treasury and Federal Reserve may lower intermediate-term rates. I anticipate that short- and intermediate-term rates will be lower over the next year, but remain higher than they were from 2009 to 2021. Table #1 shows Lipper Categories that have traditionally hedged against inflation, along with those I identified by looking at the recent period of high inflation. They are sorted by a Ranking System composed of my proprietary ranking system, three-month return, return in 2021 when inflation was rising, four-year Martin Ratio for risk-adjusted return, and yield. I have added toggles to my investment system to add or tilt weights for “Tax Efficiency” for after-tax accounts, “Risk Off” for my outlook, and “Yield” if income is an objective. Table #1 is rated for a conservative, tax-advantaged account where I am seeking income. Metrics in the table are shaded red for “worst” and blue for “best”. Table #1: Categories That Did Well During High Inflation – Four-Year Metrics Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, and Morningstar returns as of Sep 26th. The Commodities Precious Metals category did not provide much protection against inflation in 2021, but has performed well since then because of rising rates, falling dollar, and uncertainty. Notice the high maximum drawdowns of Precious Metals Equity, Real Estate, and the S&P500 relative to other categories. Inflation-protected bonds are considered safe protection against inflation. The green shaded categories are the ones that I identified in this month’s companion article, “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. The gold shaded categories are what I consider to be possible lower-risk hedges against inflation; however, commodities can be very volatile, as we will see later. The green shaded funds are the ones that I currently own, and the blue shaded funds are in my Conservative Target Portfolio for future investments. I like the Flexible Portfolio, Alternative Global Macro, and Alternative Multi-Strategy categories, where managers have the discretion to adjust according to market conditions. I used Mutual Fund Observer metrics and Portfolio Visualizer to select the following funds in Table #2 to be added to my watch list for inflation. As a general observation, they either have higher MFO Risk or lower MFO Rating for risk-adjusted returns compared to the funds in “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. Table #2: MFO Metrics for Selected Funds – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. In Table #3, I substituted Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) for Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) in my conservative portfolio from the companion article. This adjusted portfolio has an APR of 9.5% compared to 8.4% for the Conservative Portfolio; however, it also has a higher drawdown of -14.8% compared to -12.4% and the Ulcer Index increases from 2.2 to 2.9. The portfolio continues to have an MFO Risk of “Conservative” (MFO Risk =2). Table #3: MFO Portfolio Modified for More Inflation Protection – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Portfolio Tool. Figure #2 compares Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) to BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX), Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). The funds being tested have higher returns and higher volatility than the funds in my target portfolio. Figure #2: Comparison of Total Return for Selected Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. After doing the research for this article, I added around fifty funds to my investment system, which I have not had time to evaluate thoroughly. This is a task for next month to see if I want to modify my Conservative Target Portfolio. When looking to invest in a fund, I generally start with the five funds with the highest rating per Lipper Category from my spreadsheet. In a stagflationary environment like the 1970s, I would want to own a fund that invests in commodities such as the AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX). I don’t expect inflation to reach that extreme in the near term. I prefer the lower volatility of PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). More aggressive investors and those with major concerns over tariffs may prefer ARCNX. Frost Credit (FCFAX) and Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) are both good funds, with FCFAX having higher returns and yield with slightly more risk. I have rungs on my bond ladder maturing next year, and I will continually reevaluate the funds in my Conservative Target Portfolio.

The conversion of Akre Focus Fund into an ETF was authorized by its investors in September and is proceeding apace. Thanks to all who took the time to vote their shares! On October 17, abrdn International Small Cap fund and the $36m abrdn Intermediate Municipal Income fund will become the abrdn International Small Cap Active ETF and the abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Active ETF, respectively. The BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF, and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF. JPMorgan Unconstrained Debt Fund has been reorganized into the JPMorgan Flexible Debt ETF effective September 26th. Deepwater Beachfront Small Cap ETF is in registration. Joe Robillard will be the portfolio manager; expenses have not been disclosed. The ETF will primarily invest in small-cap companies. Hood River Emerging Markets Fund is in registration. Lance R. Cannon, CFA, Rohan B. Kumar, and Ruoshi Qi will be the portfolio managers. Expenses have not been stated. Sterling Capital has registered five new ETFs. Sterling Capital Ultra Short Duration; Short Duration Bond, National Municipal Bond, Multi-Strategy Income, and Equity Premium Income ETFs. Many managers, no expense ratios. The Truth Social American Energy Security ETF, Truth Social American Icons ETF, Truth Social American Next Frontiers ETF, Truth Social American Red State REITs ETF, and Truth Social American Security & Defense ETF are in registration. Matthew Tuttle will be the portfolio manager for each of the funds. Expenses have not been stated. Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF is in registration. Joshua C. Barrickman, CFA, will be the portfolio manager. Expenses have not been stated. Westwood Enhanced Income Opportunity, Enhanced Multi-Asset Income, and Enhanced Alternative Income ETFs are in registration. Numerous managers; expenses have not been stated as of this filing. Dodge and Cox is forward splitting several of its mutual funds: Balanced, International, and Stock in the amounts eight for one, four for one, and sixteen for one, respectively, at the close of business on October 24. Their reason for the stock split was the following: New mutual funds generally launch with an initial NAV of $10.00 per share. Given their earlier inception dates and asset classes, the NAVs of the Balanced Fund, International Stock Fund, and Stock Fund have grown considerably. We believe the share splits will better align these Funds’ NAVs with the other Dodge & Cox Funds’ NAVs. As of September 27, 2025, the NAV for Balanced is $110.13/share, Stock is $276.70, and International is $64.85. Leuthold Grizzly Short Fund underwent a one-for-four reverse stock split at the close of business on September 22nd, which boosted its per-share NAV from about $5 to about $20. Effective on January 21, 2026, Virtus is eliminating the Class C Shares on virtually all of its funds. Given that “C” shares are and always were a marketing malignancy (“hey, look! There’s no sales load though we do …umm, charge you 1.76% annually forever”), we always celebrate their disappearance. None that we’ve found. DoubleLine Floating Rate Fund will be reorganized into the American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund once it is approved by shareholders. The reorganization will occur sometime during the first quarter of 2026. Quick history: The American Beacon FEAC Floating Rate Income Fund was previously the Sound Point Floating Rate Income Fund until it was acquired by American Beacon. First Eagle Alternative Credit, LLC’s (FEAC) investment advisory agreement ended on June 20, 2025, at which time DoubleLine Capital commenced managing the fund, and the name of the fund was changed to American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund. DoubleLine Income Fund and DoubleLine Infrastructure Income Fund will change their names to DoubleLine Securitized Credit Fund and DoubleLine Select Income Fund, with predictable rewrites to their prospectuses, on October 28th. The hottest trend in prospectus writing? “The fund may terminate and liquidate at any time without shareholder approval,” a phrase now used by the AIM, Amplify, Collaborative Investments, ETF Opportunities, Innovators, Northern Lights, REX, SCM, Truth Social, and Ultimus ETF trusts, among others. Sub-text: “We’re just tossing s**t against the wall to see what sticks, we got no commitment to any of this stuff and want to be able to flush it as quickly and easily as possible! Welcome aboard!” 2x Daily Software Platform ETF will be liquidated on October 10, 2025. The fund launched on July 1, 2025, and no one, including the managers, cared. September 25, 2025, was a big day for the AXS Real Estate Income ETF! It managed to cease operations, liquidate its assets, and prepare to distribute proceeds to shareholders of record. Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ticker: ELON) will be liquidated on October 10, 2025, because “the Fund could not conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner over the long term due to the Fund’s inability to attract sufficient investment assets to maintain a competitive operating structure.” Here’s the strategy: short Ford, long Tesla, trust Elon. If the Morningstar charting is correct, it seems to have lost 50% in its first two weeks. Apparently, the fund, which launched in mid-February 2025, somehow lost faith and only drew $1.1 million in assets. Per Morningstar, neither of the managers risked their own money on the fund. BlackRock Sustainable High Yield Bond Fund is closing to new purchases on November 12, 2025, and will be liquidated on December 12, 2025. Franklin Sustainable International Equity ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 16, 2026. One-star fund that was wildly successful from 2017-2021 and hasn’t been able to find its butt with both … well, it has trailed 95-100% of its peers over the past 1, 3, and 5 year periods. Harding, Loevner Chinese Equity and Emerging Markets ex China have begun the process of liquidating their assets, which the managers expect to complete by November 19, 2025. Same team, negligible assets. Johnson International Fund, which was launched in 2008, will be liquidated on November 21, 2025. A curious development, really. The fund has had the same manager since inception. He’s been very successful as the lead manager on the Johnson Opportunity Fund, but international has managed to pretty consistently trail 80-100% of its peers and has attracted negligible assets. Kempner Multi-Cap Deep Value fund will be liquidated on or about October 15, 2025. Penn Mutual AM Strategic Income Fund and Penn Mutual AM 1847 Income Fund will cease operations and liquidate on or about November 14, 2025. Themes Airlines ETF and Themes European Luxury ETF closed and liquidated on September 12, 2025. T Rowe Price Global Consumer Fund will be liquidated on November 14, 2025. T Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund will experience liquidation and dissolution on or about January 23, 2026. No reason given, though performance sort of sucks. It’s a Price fund whose five-year records (1.89%) barely exceed its expense ratio (1.19%). The mandate was to outperform cash with low volatility and low correlation to the stock and bond markets. The “edge” was that the managers had immediate and ongoing access to other T Rowe Price managers, which gave them exceptional insights into movements across asset classes. The system may have broken down when Price had an internal restructure, which impeded the managers’ daily strategy pipeline. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 Billion Bet on a Lesser-Known Data Center Firm

(Bloomberg) -- At the start of the year, a lesser-known infrastructure company called Aligned Data Centers managed to pull off a $12 billion fundraise — more than some of the world’s leading artificial intelligence startups have been able to secure in a single round. The goal: dramatically expanding its footprint to support surging demand for the facilities that power AI systems. Nine months later, with much of that build-out still in the works, Aligned is in advanced discussions to be acquired by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners in a $40 billion deal. It’s on pace to be one of the largest transactions of the year and potentially the biggest ever for any data center company. The takeover talks, which Bloomberg News reported late Thursday citing people familiar with the matter, are indicative of just how much money investors are willing to throw at companies viewed as integral for the AI boom. According to a Goldman Sachs report issued Thursday, AI-related companies have accounted for $141 billion in corporate credit issuance so far this year, already eclipsing the $127 billion in total debt last year. As tech companies say they’re prepared to spend hundreds of billions, if not trillions, on physical infrastructure for AI, there’s growing demand for firms like Aligned that promise to meet those needs. That’s true even if most of Aligned’s data center capacity – and the revenue expected from it – is still in the planning stages. “They have a lot of planned activity,” Ari Klein, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said about Aligned in particular. “You’re probably seeing companies paying up for that planned activity, or what could come.” Founded in 2013, nearly a decade before the generative AI boom, Aligned has long focused on providing custom data centers for businesses, with an emphasis on efficiency and sustainability. The company is backed by Macquarie Asset Management and has 78 data centers under management or in development across the Americas, according to its website. As with other data center providers, Aligned has come under new pressure to build more and bigger data centers in recent years for AI. In January, Aligned said it had raised $12 billion in equity and debt to speed up its plans to build out 5 gigawatts of data center capacity, or enough to power half of New York City on a hot day. The investment was intended to help Align “seize opportunities driven by the surging demand for AI-ready infrastructure,” said Andrew Schaap, the company’s chief executive officer, in a social media post at the time. “Aligned is ready to meet this moment.” The only challenge is that data centers — and all the infrastructure, including power supplies to support them — take time. Currently, Aligned has just over 600 megawatts of data center capacity that’s live, with another 700 megawatts of capacity under construction, according to DC Byte, a market intelligence firm that tracks the industry. Still, the combined capacity makes Aligned a “decent-sized operation,” according to DC Byte founder Edward Galvin. Coreweave Inc., a cloud provider that has struck deals with OpenAI and Nvidia Corp., has 470 megawatts of live capacity, according to public filings, with much more planned. CoreWeave reported just over $1.91 billion in revenue in 2024. And while Aligned is in talks to sell potentially for $40 billion, Coreweave has a market value of more than $65 billion. Aligned has not publicly disclosed its sales figures. If it charged about $210 per kilowatt per month, the industry standard for data center pricing according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE, Aligned’s annual revenue would be nearly $1.6 billion. That figure would rise to $3.4 billion, including the capacity under construction. Representatives for Aligned did not respond to a request for comment. By comparison, Fermi Inc., a real estate investment trust looking to draw data center tenants, saw its market value top $19 billion in its public debut this week. The company, co-founded by former US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, has no revenue – a sign of the frothy market for any business tied to the AI infrastructure boom. On its website, Aligned said its customers have included Nutanix Inc., a cloud software company, Datto, an IT provider, as well as an unnamed government agency and multinational fintech company, among others. Aligned is also developing a new data center in Texas for Lambda Inc., a cloud infrastructure company that’s backed by Nvidia. The data center is still under construction. --With assistance from Olivia Solon. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Carney-championed Net-Zero Banking Alliance shuts down after losing most of its members

Mark Carney makes a keynote address in London in 2020 ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26. Mr. Carney helped establish the Net-Zero Banking Alliance while serving as a UN special envoy on climate action and finance.POOL New/AFP/Getty Images Almost exactly four years after Prime Minister Mark Carney convinced Canada’s largest financial institutions to join a global alliance committed to net-zero emissions related to their lending, the organization is shutting down. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, which Mr. Carney helped to establish in April, 2021, while serving as a United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance, ceased operations Friday after losing most of its membership. Political pressure from Republican lawmakers in the United States led the alliance’s largest American members to abandon the group in late 2024. All of Canada’s largest lenders also bailed earlier this year. The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for comment. Analysis: Canada’s industrial carbon pricing system is a mess. Here’s how Carney can fix it When the alliance was first established ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union was the sole Canadian member of the group that included 63 financial institutions from 32 countries with US$40-trillion in assets. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada jointly announced plans to join the group in October, 2021. The alliance went on to publish more than a dozen reports that, according to its website, helped almost 150 banks around the world develop climate-related business strategies and set more than 500 sectoral net-zero targets. After a widespread backlash to climate-related corporate initiatives that accelerated after the election victory of U.S. President Donald Trump in November, 2024, businesses started a mass exodus from environmentally focused groups. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, the sister organization to the alliance for institutional investors that had more than 325 members managing a combined US$57.5-trillion in assets, also suspended operations in January after its largest member – BlackRock Inc. – decided to leave. Shortly before leaving the alliance, the chief executives of RBC and BMO suggested it was no longer the best mechanism for financial institutions to pursue their climate goals. “If our countries have an objective to get to a certain point, we will be part of that, and therefore pulling out of NZBA hypothetically doesn’t lead to non-commitment to net-zero climate change,” RBC chief executive Dave McKay said at a Jan. 8 conference, one week before the lender left the alliance. “It just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can’t do and how you report, maybe that is not the right mechanism to do it,” he said. Speaking at the same conference, BMO chief executive Darryl White said the bank was still committed to climate transition, but added, “We also have a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers, and we will not abandon that.” “What mechanism you choose to join or bodies that you choose to align with to enforce that – that’s just a pathway,” Mr. White said. “The ultimate goal is unchanged.” Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist at Greenpeace Canada, said the collapse of the alliance highlights the limits of relying on voluntary measures. “While Mark Carney the central banker warned the world of the risk climate change posed to the financial system, Mark Carney the Prime Minister can protect our economy and environment by bringing in rules that force banks to take a longer term perspective and shift investment from fossil fuels to clean energy,” Mr. Stewart said in an e-mail.

Title: Regulators approve disputed $6.2B takeover of Minnesota Power by investment group

Time Published: 2025-10-03T18:06:14Z
Full Content:
By STEVE KARNOWSKI and MARC LEVY, Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group’s takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates. In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power’s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility’s owner. Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S. Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change under BlackRock and that the deal’s cost wouldn’t affect electric rates. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock. The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department’s attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest. The commission’s chair, Katie Sieben, agreed. “Because of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we’ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,” Sieben said. Opposing the deal were the state attorney general’s office and industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other iron mine owners, Enbridge-run oil pipelines, and pulp and paper mills. Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with “a high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,” and “assumed the absolute worst in these investors.” But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest. Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval. “Private equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry. Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Are Roaring Again. Can They Keep Climbing?

Time Published: 2025-10-03T17:57:53Z
Full Content:
Last year's Magnificent 7 tech leaders are rolling again. That hasn't always been the case this year. As a group, the the large-cap technology companies—Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—have lagged the broader market for most of 2025. That's led to questions about whether the grouping's reign is over or if its membership should change. Then came September's rally. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is now up nearly 20% year-to-date, ahead of the S&P 500's close to 15% gain; it more than doubled the benchmark index's performance in the third quarter. The question now: What next? The bullishness hasn't dried up. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said Thursday that growth stocks, particularly those with ties to AI, were supported in the third quarter by strong earnings, expectations of AI-driven growth, and easing interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive. Wall Street analysts largely expect those trends to continue. There's wariness about a bubble in AI; Even Jeff Bezos has suggested that it's in a kind of "industrial bubble" in which it can be difficult for investors to identify the future winners and losers from the field of would-be standouts. Bank of America analysts on Friday said that "every bubble in history popped by central bank tightening, and no central bank in the world has hiked rates in past 2 months." A recent survey of Investopedia readers suggested cooling optimism about the stock market, though they said they remain heavily invested in growth stocks even with valuations at high levels. The Magnificent 7’s resurgence comes on the back of a rebound by tech heavyweights like Tesla and Apple, which had spent most of the year in the red. Their influence within the S&P 500, meanwhile, illustrates the power the group of tech giants have on global markets. The recent performance of some Magnificent 7 stocks highlights the breadth of the enthusiasm. AI darling Nvidia, which has seen its stock rise steadily since April as sales of its chips boomed and trade policy headwinds eased, remains the biggest gainer of the year. But Tesla, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple have been the biggest contributors to the group's advance in recent weeks after spending a large part of the year in negative territory. Gains for Tesla's stock, which added a third of its value in September, came as worries about CEO Elon Musk's political activities and slumping sales cooled, and bulls shifted their focus toward the electric vehicle maker's advances in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI. Alphabet climbed about 15% in September after a major legal win in which a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser. Apple rose close to 10% after signs of surprisingly strong demand for its latest iPhone 17 and inroads with the Trump administration. All this has many market watchers wondering when the party might end but unwilling to leave just yet. Pictet Asset Management Chief Strategist Luca Paolini on Friday noted the expectation of lower rates and strong corporate profits among reasons to "see upside in equities despite possible impacts of the US government shutdown." Pictet, he wrote, sees "upside in riskier asset classes in the short term." This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent market levels.

Title: ‘Disgraceful record’: Kash Patel’s FBI cuts all ties to Southern Poverty Law Center

By Tyler O'Neil, The Daily Signal October 3, 2025 FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—The FBI has confirmed that it severed all ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left activist group that puts conservatives and Christians on a “hate map” along with Ku Klux Klan chapters. The “hate map” has inspired at least one terrorist attack against a conservative organization. “The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine,” FBI Director Kash Patel told The Daily Signal in a statement Friday. “Their so-called hate map has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence.” “That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership,” Patel added. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! The FBI confirmed that it has no intelligence products from the SPLC and does not engage in contact or information sharing with the SPLC. The statement comes days after Patel told Fox News Digital that the FBI had severed ties with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit that opposes antisemitism but also leans left and condemns critics of transgender ideology. While the SPLC began as a public interest law firm focused on civil rights cases, it gained its reputation by suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy and developed a decades-long relationship with law enforcement combatting real hate. After the Klan largely disappeared, the SPLC started targeting mainstream conservative and Christian groups, putting them on a “hate map” alongside Klan chapters. In 2012, a domestic terrorist used the “hate map” to target the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C. He planned to kill everyone in the building. A building manager largely foiled the attack, but suffered lifelong injuries in the process. The SPLC condemned the attack, but kept the council on the “hate map” ever since. The man who opened fire at a Republican practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, nearly killing then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, had “liked” the SPLC on Facebook. The SPLC condemned that attack, as well. The SPLC added Turning Point USA to the “hate map” mere months before an assassin with a transgender boyfriend allegedly murdered Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. The SPLC condemned the attack, but has not removed Turning Point USA from the “hate map.” A bureau official told The Daily Signal that the FBI was aware that the “hate map” included Turning Point USA before the shooting. Patel noted that he had previously criticized the SPLC at a panel on anti-Christian bias. “In April, during our Anti-Christian Bias Panel, I made it clear that the FBI will never rely on politicized or agenda-driven intelligence from outside groups—and certainly not from the SPLC,” the FBI director told The Daily Signal. “Under this FBI, all ties with the SPLC have officially been terminated.” At that April event, Patel slammed the FBI under President Joe Biden’s administration, particularly for the notorious memo in which the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, office (working with other field offices) urged agents to develop sources inside traditionalist Catholic churches and to target “Radical Traditional Catholic hate groups,” citing the SPLC. Critics have long accused the SPLC of being anti-Christian, and the group responded to these claims by noting that it does not put all Christian groups on the “hate map.” For years, the SPLC cited its decision not to put the organization Focus on the Family on the “hate map” as evidence it wasn’t anti-Christian. This year, it added Focus to the map. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pledged that the Justice Department would not partner with groups like the SPLC. The Biden administration reversed that, however. The SPLC has tremendous impact inside and outside of law enforcement. Then-SPLC President Margaret Huang bragged in a 2021 donor meeting that “many agencies in the new Biden administration” reached out to “solicit our expertise” to “help shape the policies that the new administration is adopting to counter the domestic terrorism threat.” That wasn’t hyperbole. The Justice Department received a briefing from the SPLC shortly after it added Moms for Liberty to the “hate map” in June 2023. Big Tech companies like Amazon have used the “hate map” to screen recipients for its former AmazonSmile program, where customers could designate a portion of their purchases go to support certain charities and other nonprofits. Companies like Eventbrite, PayPal, and Hyatt Hotels have relied on the SPLC’s “hate” accusations to decide who they will allow to use their platforms and facilities. Donor networks worth billions have pledged to keep charitable funds from going to SPLC-labeled “hate groups.” The SPLC enjoys this impact despite multiple scandals. The center fired its co-founder and saw its president resign in a 2019 racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal. Amid that scandal, SPLC staff created a union that is part of a union organization that represents the radical anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace. And amid a round of layoffs last year, the SPLC Union accused the center of engaging in “union-busting.” Despite its penurious name, the SPLC has an endowment of more than $700 million, compensates its leaders handsomely, and possesses more than $30 million in offshore accounts, according to IRS filings. Finally, the SPLC has troubling ties to Antifa, the loosely-organized movement of far-left agitators that President Donald Trump recently declared a domestic terrorist group.

BlackRock is expanding its membership in the club of AI datacenter investors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Another day, another blimp with billions flying the skies of AI. Today's currency transfer comes from BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an investment fund set to write a big check to buy out Aligned Data Centers, a large AI datacenter company. Bloomberg cites sources with knowledge of the deal and pins the amount at a tidy $40 billion. Aligned may not be a household name in tech news, but according to its website, the company has 78 datacenters in locations around the U.S. and South America, totaling 5 GW of processing power capacity across current and future developments. Bloomberg remarks that Aligned got a $12 billion investment in January and was one of the companies that recently met with President Trump about speeding up the country's AI development. Aligned is also attracting attention from investor AGX (backed by Mubadala Investment Co.), which apparently wants to cut a separate deal with the datacenter provider. The report remarks that the deal is set to be inked in a few days, but is not yet finalized. However, it's hard to imagine the agreement being called off in this age, where AI businesses' exponential growth has every investor under the sun tossing money at the prospect of massive short-term lucre. The $40 billion in play makes this deal one of the biggest this year, though it's still early October, and it wouldn't be surprising to see other large bets in short order. Upon completion of the deal, Aligned would be joining CyrusOne in GIP's AI datacenter portfolio. The fund's many-paged checkbook isn't going back in the drawer anytime soon, either; it's reportedly considering buying out power company AES Corp. If this news sounds familiar, it's because it's reminiscent of datacenter provider CoreWeave getting a $6.4 billion infusion from OpenAI just recently. As for Sam Altman's company, it's been cutting deals like crazy, the biggest ones a $300 billion contract with Oracle, and a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia for building 10 GW's worth of datacenters.

Title: State regulators approve sale of Allete

Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ST. PAUL — Minnesota regulators signed off on the final approval needed to sell Allete to a pair of private investment firms. The five-member Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Friday voted unanimously to approve the sale of Minnesota Power’s Duluth-based parent company to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners. ADVERTISEMENT The $6.2 billion deal, announced in May 2024, drew concern over private equity’s ownership of a utility and the potential for rising electricity rates. “We are grateful to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for their thorough review and approval of this important and strategic partnership, and recognition that this is in the public interest,” Bethany Owen, chair, president and CEO of Allete, said in a news release following the decision. “Today’s decision caps a comprehensive public process and positions ALLETE well to meet the significant infrastructure demands of the clean-energy transition without compromising the high-quality service and commitments to reliability and affordability that define our company,” Owen said. The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, a consumer advocacy group, several environmental groups and Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers were opposed to the sale, and an administrative law judge in July recommended, in a nonbinding opinion, that the PUC reject the deal as it wasn’t in the public interest. The role of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, came under particular scrutiny. Groups opposed to the deal feared Minnesota Power would favor deals that would benefit other BlackRock-owned companies at the expense of ratepayers. But Commissioner Hwikwom Ham disagreed, arguing that the fiduciary responsibility of CPP and BlackRock-owned GIP would prevent that and that the PUC itself could protect ratepayers from this in future rate cases. “The Commission’s confidence that they have the capacity, authority, and objectivity to regulate the likes of BlackRock — a financial behemoth that has tentacles in every part of the global economy — rings hollow, especially when they already oversee regular utility rate hikes that families struggle to afford,” said Maggie Schuppert, director of strategic intiatives for CURE, one of the environmental groups opposed to the deal. ADVERTISEMENT “It will fall on community and ratepayer advocates, utility watchdogs, and the public itself to hold these entities and the PUC to account and mitigate the harms of this decision,” Schuppert said. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, unions, a different consumer advocacy group and several clean energy groups supported the deal. Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer of clean energy group Fresh Energy, said the group lent its support for the sale of Minnesota Power when it decided the deal “would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota.” “We applaud the Commission for remaining focused on the substance of the issues at hand and what’s in the public interest of Minnesotans,” Gleckner said. Allete, which has long been publicly traded on the stock market, has maintained that going private under the ownership of GIP and CPP would allow it to more quickly and reliably access the money needed to fund its transition away from coal and carbon emissions and reach Minnesota’s law requiring 100% of the state’s electricity to be carbon-free by 2040. PUC Chair Katie Sieben said that while it “drove me nuts” to hear that the acquisition was needed to meet that law, she believed the PUC should approve the deal because investment was necessary to ensure reliability and affordability. “Whether Minnesota Power is publicly traded or privately held, it needs to comply with the laws of the state of Minnesota, including the state's 2040 carbon-free law. … Minnesota Power does need massive amounts of investment,” Sieben said. “That's not due to the state's carbon-free law necessarily, but also due to the fact that many of the utilities' assets are at end of age and need investment.” ADVERTISEMENT She added that support from commissioners came at different stages of the process, as parties involved in the proceedings reached agreements that got “it over the net benefit threshold of what would be in the public interest.” Throughout the nearly year and a half that the deal was in front of the PUC, and in particular the last few weeks, Allete, GIP and CPP have agreed to a series of commitments, including: Some PUC members said Friday that they had originally been skeptical about the deal, and Commissioner Joseph Sullivan said he had been opposed to the deal as recently as the Sept. 25 oral arguments but ultimately supported the sale Friday. “I still do have concerns in the out years … I’m concerned about what happens in the future, 10-15 years from now,” Sullivan said. “But I do think that the benefits in the near term and medium term clearly outweigh the status quo and clearly show that the partners, the parties, are taking very serious their commitment to the state.” He acknowledged the concerns residents of Northeastern Minnesota have about the deal and instructed Minnesota Power, GIP and CPP to build credibility with the public and customers. “If you don’t build that credibility,” Sullivan said, “that will redound unfavorably to everybody.” This story was updated at 2:40 p.m. Oct. 3 with details from Friday's meeting and reaction to the deal's approval. It was originally posted at 11:24 a.m. Oct. 3. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Dozens of firms are on the verge of gaining acceptance to create an ETF as one of the share classes of a mutual fund. October 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- For more than two decades, US money managers have looked on enviously as Vanguard Group reaped the benefits of a unique structure that grafted the advantages of an ETF onto its biggest mutual funds. The design, protected by patent, saved its investors billions of dollars and helped the Jack Bogle-founded firm grow into an $11 trillion giant. Now, in what could be the most consequential shift in the American investment industry in years, Vanguard is finally set to lose that competitive edge. Dozens of rival asset managers are on the brink of adopting the same structure, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it will allow the quantitative firm Dimensional Fund Advisors to do so in the coming weeks. Roughly 80 more competitors are in the queue for approval, including nearly every major name in the business. The model they want to follow creates an exchange-traded fund as one of the share classes of a mutual fund, a move that ports the famous tax efficiency of the younger structure to the older vehicle. Assuming the approvals come, it will likely trigger a wave of new ETF launches, re-write the tax and performance of countless mutual funds, and potentially finally erode the barrier that has until now largely locked ETFs out of the American retirement system. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “We already feel like we’re attached to a rocket ship, moving as fast as we can to launch more products,” said Brittany Christensen, head of business development and senior vice president at Tidal Financial Group, which helps create and run ETFs. “When I think about putting more fuel on that fire, that’s absolutely what this does.” Technical challenges to implementing the new structure remain, so the landscape won’t alter overnight. And since most major money managers already offer ETFs — having long ago given in to investor demand for the easier-to-trade, often cheaper vehicles — some market watchers have questioned how many will actually deploy it. But the size of the waitlist — more than six-times the number of firms that were racing for approval to launch Bitcoin funds — suggests huge industry-wide enthusiasm to take up the Vanguard blueprint. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said it’s “like sitting on a bunch of CDs and here’s a chance to convert them all into digital.” Asset manager giants including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group and Franklin Resources Inc. are among the firms seeking regulatory permission to deploy the hybrid structure. Some have been waiting for about two years, ever since Vanguard’s patent expired. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) In a virtual meeting on Monday, the SEC told pending applicants they should conform their filings to that of DFA’s, but did not provide guarantees on when they would sign off on the next applications, according to four people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and F/m Investments are among those that have already updated their paperwork. “This is big for the T. Rowes of this world that don’t already have super well-established ETF businesses and they’re suffering outflows from their mutual funds,” said Adam Sabban, associate director, equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. While it’s unclear if it will help generate new inflows, “it could help them retain their current assets and slow the pace of outflows,” he said. Some firms, including F/m, are looking to create mutual fund share classes of ETFs, opening the door for those products to break into 401ks. The pension system was built around mutual funds, and most platforms are not equipped to handle the intraday moves and liquidity of an ETF. Unexpectedly, even the pioneer of the ETF-within-a-mutual-fund model is on the waitlist. Vanguard only has permission to use the structure on passive funds, so the firm is now seeking approval to deploy it in active products. Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs “The multi-share class ETF structure has served Vanguard index investors well for more than two decades,” said a company spokesperson. “The structure has multiple benefits for both conventional mutual fund and ETF investors, and Vanguard looks forward to bringing the benefits of the multi-share class ETF structure to investors in active funds.” Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard first introduced the model in 2001, when ETFs were still in their infancy. Recognizing its potential value, the firm obtained a patent that restricted rivals from using it until 2023. Technically, the dual share class structure remained available for other issuers, provided they agreed a licensing arrangement with Vanguard and gained exemptive relief from the SEC. But in the years since granting Vanguard approval, the watchdog developed worries relating to conflicts of interest among share classes, and no other exemptions were given. The SEC said it intends to approve DFA’s relief application later in October, unless there is a request for a hearing on the matter. “For too long, the artificial divide between mutual fund and ETF share classes has limited investor choice, operational efficiency, and resulted in suboptimal tax treatment,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said in a Monday statement. The proposed approval will facilitate competition because “similar relief has been long held by a single asset manager,” he said. The regulator said on Wednesday that owing to the government shutdown it was unable to provide further comment. The level of maturity already reached by the ETF industry may blunt the impact of the widespread use of the dual share class structure. Dave Nadig, president and director of research at etf.com, believes that any issuer with a decent approach will have pushed into ETFs years ago. Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs Investments Inc., sees potential for this to be a “Y2K moment,” where significant time and resources are spent to achieve very little. Firms planning to deploy dual share classes face plenty of practical hurdles. A May report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. argued that launching a successful ETF strategy “is not just as simple as adding a share class to an existing mutual fund and expecting it to gain assets.” “An issuer needs to focus on the addition of capital markets services, a specific ETF distribution plan, platform strategies, and operational impacts as part of a successful launch plan,” the authors wrote. One issue is how firms will handle investors who want to switch, tax-free, from the mutual fund share class into the ETF class, to benefit from the intraday liquidity in the latter wrapper. The process is not automatic and requires both the asset manager and the individual investor to take action. “There’s some work left to be done with the platforms in terms of making that operationally more efficient,” Gerard O’Reilly, DFA’s co-CEO and co-CIO, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. DFA is hoping to have ETF share classes for a number of mutual funds available in the first couple months of 2026, he said. Meanwhile, issuers launching an ETF for the first time will need to liaise with market makers, which play a key role in keeping fund shares trading through the day — something not needed by mutual funds. If mutual fund companies launch ETF share classes en masse, it could put huge demand on the market-making ecosystem. It’s also an open question whether broker-dealers, who have strict requirements to operate in the best interest of their clients, will need to shift assets into the ETF share class, or whether they will be required to allow both share classes of the same fund on their platforms simultaneously. In a survey by Cerulli Associates in May, more than half of ETF issuers polled said “broker-dealer reluctance to approve/make share classes available on platform” was a significant challenge. “Although we’ve been working with several asset managers on operational readiness, I still think there’s going to be work for some of them — especially with the distribution channel, with the broker-dealers — to ensure that everyone’s ready for this,” said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF Solutions at State Street. Still, the direction of travel is clear, according to Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. He said all concerns and obstacles facing the use of ETF share classes would be overcome within as little as three years. “ETFs are playing a starring role in life after mutual funds,” he said. “Their role is going to be elevated even further now.” Emily Graffeo Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 1, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Title: Sam Altman on AI bubble: ‘People make some dumb capital allocations’ from time to time

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company’s valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don’t meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company’s AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that “over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. —— AP Philanthropy Writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report. ———- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: BREAKING: Kash Patel’s FBI Cuts All Ties to Southern Poverty Law Center

PoliticsCommentary SecurityNews SecurityNews PoliticsSecurityNews Health CareCommentary PoliticsNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews SocietyNews InternationalNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews Commentary News PoliticsNews International News SocietyNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews PoliticsCommentary Education Analysis SocietyCommentary PoliticsAnalysis Commentary Commentary Commentary Commentary SecurityNews FBI Director Kash Patel (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images) Tyler O'Neil / @Tyler2ONeil Tyler O'Neil is senior editor at The Daily Signal and the author of two books: "Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center," and "The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government." FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—The FBI has confirmed that it severed all ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left activist group that puts conservatives and Christians on a “hate map” along with Ku Klux Klan chapters. The “hate map” has inspired at least one terrorist attack against a conservative organization. “The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine,” FBI Director Kash Patel told The Daily Signal in a statement Friday. “Their so-called hate map has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence.” “That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership,” Patel added. The FBI confirmed that it has no intelligence products from the SPLC and does not engage in contact or information sharing with the SPLC. The statement comes days after Patel told Fox News Digital that the FBI had severed ties with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit that opposes antisemitism but also leans left and condemns critics of transgender ideology. While the SPLC began as a public interest law firm focused on civil rights cases, it gained its reputation by suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy and developed a decades-long relationship with law enforcement combating real hate. After the Klan largely disappeared, the SPLC started targeting mainstream conservative and Christian groups, putting them on a “hate map” alongside Klan chapters. In 2012, a domestic terrorist used the “hate map” to target the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C. He planned to kill everyone in the building. A building manager largely foiled the attack, but suffered lifelong injuries in the process. The SPLC condemned the attack, but kept the council on the “hate map” ever since. The man who opened fire at a Republican practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, nearly killing then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, had “liked” the SPLC on Facebook. The SPLC condemned that attack, as well. The SPLC added Turning Point USA to the “hate map” mere months before an assassin with a transgender boyfriend allegedly murdered Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. The SPLC condemned the attack, but has not removed Turning Point USA from the “hate map.” A bureau official told The Daily Signal that the FBI was aware that the “hate map” included Turning Point USA before the shooting. Patel noted that he had previously criticized the SPLC at a panel on anti-Christian bias. “In April, during our Anti-Christian Bias Panel, I made it clear that the FBI will never rely on politicized or agenda-driven intelligence from outside groups—and certainly not from the SPLC,” the FBI director told The Daily Signal. “Under this FBI, all ties with the SPLC have officially been terminated.” At that April event, Patel slammed the FBI under President Joe Biden’s administration, particularly for the notorious memo in which the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, office (working with other field offices) urged agents to develop sources inside traditionalist Catholic churches and to target “Radical Traditional Catholic hate groups,” citing the SPLC. Critics have long accused the SPLC of being anti-Christian, and the group responded to these claims by noting that it does not put all Christian groups on the “hate map.” For years, the SPLC cited its decision not to put the organization Focus on the Family on the “hate map” as evidence it wasn’t anti-Christian. This year, it added Focus to the map. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pledged that the Justice Department would not partner with groups like the SPLC. The Biden administration reversed that, however. The SPLC has tremendous impact inside and outside of law enforcement. Then-SPLC President Margaret Huang bragged in a 2021 donor meeting that “many agencies in the new Biden administration” reached out to “solicit our expertise” to “help shape the policies that the new administration is adopting to counter the domestic terrorism threat.” That wasn’t hyperbole. The Justice Department received a briefing from the SPLC shortly after it added Moms for Liberty to the “hate map” in June 2023. Big Tech companies like Amazon have used the “hate map” to screen recipients for its former AmazonSmile program, where customers could designate a portion of their purchases go to support certain charities and other nonprofits. Companies like Eventbrite, PayPal, and Hyatt Hotels have relied on the SPLC’s “hate” accusations to decide who they will allow to use their platforms and facilities. Donor networks worth billions have pledged to keep charitable funds from going to SPLC-labeled “hate groups.” The SPLC enjoys this impact despite multiple scandals. The center fired its co-founder and saw its president resign in a 2019 racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal. Amid that scandal, SPLC staff created a union that is part of a union organization that represents the radical anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace. And amid a round of layoffs last year, the SPLC Union accused the center of engaging in “union-busting.” Despite its penurious name, the SPLC has an endowment of more than $700 million, compensates its leaders handsomely, and possesses more than $30 million in offshore accounts, according to IRS filings. Finally, the SPLC has troubling ties to Antifa, the loosely-organized movement of far-left agitators that President Donald Trump recently declared a domestic terrorist group.

The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: Lenovo LOQ 15 Gen10 review

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model. PC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You know what my biggest bugbear is for budget laptops? It's the screen. It is always the screen. For some reason, notebook manufacturers seem to have this almost obsession with pairing massively underwhelming graphics cards with panels that would put most 4K TVs to shame. It's madness. Yes, they might be these phenomenally pixel-dense, OLED, 240 Hz, crystal-clear colour, uber mode displays, capable of projecting the most beautiful, stunning picture you've ever seen in your life directly into your retinas. But as soon as you load up a game and that mobile GPU kicks into life, fans whirring at a million miles a minute, you'll inevitably be graced with the slow chug of growing disappointment, as the approximation of a AAA power-point presentation starts juddering its way across your shiny new device. It's driven me mad for years. That might sound ridiculous, I'll admit that, but I've reviewed a lot of budget laptops in my time that do this, and it's frustrating because it doesn't need to be the case. You gain very little by doing that. Thank the dear and fluffy lord Gabe Newell then (he doesn't have anything to do with this, I don't think, I haven't checked), that Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 ditches that seemingly age-old laptop manufacturer mantra in favor of a more practical GPU and screen pairing instead. At its core, the Gen10 comes complete with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, a Ryzen 7 250, and, more importantly than that, a simple, elegant, beautifully crisp and punchy 15.6-inch, 1920x1080 IPS display, running at around 144 Hz. And it does all of that with a sub $1400 price point. Now, yes, I know what you're thinking, technically, no, that graphics card isn't really a "true" RTX 5060. I mean, it sort of is, so far as the name's the same and the core RTX Blackwell architecture matches it as well, but it's lost about 15% of its CUDA cores, and a not-so-subtle 12% of everything else, (ray tracing cores, ROPs, TMUs, Tensor cores, you know, all the good stuff that makes DLSS 4, kinda, work). Heck, I suppose we should be thankful it still touts that same 8 GB of GDDR7 VRAM. Model No: 15AHP10CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 250GPU: Nvidia RTX 5060 115WRAM: 16 GB DDR5-5600Storage: 512 GB PCIe 4.0 SSDScreen Size: 15.6-inch IPSRefresh Rate: 144 HzResolution: 1920 x 1080Battery: 60 WhrDimensions: 15.6 ~ 23.9 mm x 359.9 mm x 258.7 mm | 0.94 x 14.17 x 10.19 inchesWeight: 2.3 kg | 5.07 lbsPrice: $1,389 | £1,300 The good news, though, is that on the whole, that mobile RTX 5060 does actually deliver when it comes to 1080p gaming. Most titles easily averaged well into the 60 fps mark and above, the only exception, of course, being Cyberpunk 2077 without any DLSS support (which still achieved a relatively respectable 36 fps). Chuck on DLSS Quality and the beautiful silky goodness that is MFG, and that too climbs well into the 100s. It's so refreshing to be able to just game at your native resolution on a laptop at this price point, without having to worry about dialling the graphics preset down, or swapping around resolutions and getting stretched pixels or worse. Plus, that 15.6-inch screen is already delivering a pixel density greater than a 32-inch 4K panel does. Alrighty. Stop the press, cancel the review, clearly this is the best gaming laptop of 2025, right? Isn't that right, tiny human? Well, just hang on one minute. It's not all sun-lit uplands and frame rates. We need to talk about the storage and memory setup on this thing. Because, to be blunt. It sucks. In its default configuration, the one I'm testing here, the LOQ 15 comes with a single stick of 16 GB DDR5 at 5,600 MT/s. Do you know what Ryzen loves more than memory frequency? Memory bandwidth. There are times, particularly when loading programs, running multiple applications, or intense, high-load activities, when you almost feel this stuttering effect occur on the Gen10. There's a lag as you attempt to move an application across the screen or open up Task Manager. It's chilling to be blunt, giving Windows Vista vibes, and I don't like it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For an additional $65, Lenovo will pop an extra 16 GB stick in there for you, but to be honest, this should've been two 8GB dual-channel sticks to begin with, retaining that budget price point. At least so you're not left wondering if the whole system's locking up because you just opened Paint, or because your memory setup sucks. Again, on the SSD front, it's similarly just not good enough. The stock model is a SanDisk WD Blue SN5000S, QLC affair, not too dissimilar from the WD Blue SN5000 I reviewed late last year. That's fine, nothing particularly wrong with that for a budget unit. At least, that is, until you see the capacity. It's a 512 GB model, which once Windows is installed, sits at around 370 GB of total available space. I couldn't even install our entire benchmarking suite in one go; it was that small. I had to test games, then delete them and install other games and then test those… Again, Lenovo will happily pop in a 1 TB variant, but for an additional $60 added on to the price tag, which should've been included as standard, given it's a gaming laptop. My list of mild grievances continues with the battery life, which petered out at just 89 minutes. Although that is better than some of the more premium, more power-hungry units out there, the LOQ is generally hampered by its relatively small 60 WHr battery and AMD's relatively power-hungry Ryzen 7 250 CPU. Now, I've been harsh here, I have. This is a budget notebook, effectively. It can't all be brilliant at the end of it all, and there is still a lot to love about it, far beyond that of just the screen being the right pick for that graphics card. CPU performance is impressive, even with that single-channel memory, and it beats out other RTX 5060 notebooks like Gigabyte's Gaming A16 in average fps too, that one in particular featuring an Intel Core i7-13620H (a damning indictment of Intel's currently poor Ultra line gaming performance, it'd seem), which is nothing to sniff at. And the overall build quality of this thing? Purely outstanding. It is a gaming notebook; you can tell that from the get-go, there's no hiding that. There are angles and edges, embossed logos, and a jutting webcam divot, among other things, along with a whole host of I/O ports protruding out of its bottom. But it's not ostentatious. There's a suaveness to it, from the "luna grey" metallic satin finish to the heft and bulk of the thing. It feels solid, yet remains sleek, like it's designed for even the most aggro of esports streamers to wail on after they go 0-3 in competitive. I've played around with laptops four times the cost of this thing that pale in comparison when it comes to the build quality on show here, and that's not nothing. ✅ You don't mind the upgrade path: There's no denying it. The single-channel memory and 512 GB SSD on the base model are massively underwhelming. If you don't mind spending a little extra or can upgrade the two, then the Lenovo LOQ 15 is a fine choice for 1080p gaming. ❌ You're looking for something with a bit more flair: Aside from the above, the LOQ is very much a marmite style. You'll either love how subtle it is for a gaming notebook or despise it. If you're looking for something a little flashier, this ain't it. Cooling is impressive as well, and throughout my time testing, temps rarely got over 70 degrees, even under intense loads. Yes, fan noise is a thing, particularly when it's plugged in, but it's all manageable in Lenovo's Legion app, which, although relatively barebones, does a good enough job of managing noise in exchange for heat, which again you've got a good 20 degrees to play with. There are, of course, your state-mandated AI apps integrated in here as well, requiring Lenovo account sign-up and more, along with the usual intrusive McAfee anti-virus pre-install to be aware of, but from a software perspective, that's about it for bloatware. Elegant. Sophisticated. Well paired. Dialled in to a T. Yet flawed. That is what the LOQ 15 represents. With resplendent gaming performance and a sleek, sharp design that eschews the usual "gamer" nonsense in favor of sophisticated style instead, it's a laptop that checks a lot of boxes. Yet, it's not without fault, and although it entertains well enough, it could've been far, far better if only Lenovo had tweaked that entry-level model's configuration first. Still, for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find an RTX 5060 notebook that packs as much punch as the LOQ 15 does into that price, and for that, I doth my hat to you fine Lenovo, you have done well. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model.

Title: Nvidia And Fujitsu Team Up To Build AI Systems For The Future

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strengthening its alliance with Fujitsu to co-develop full-stack artificial intelligence infrastructure, a move aimed at accelerating enterprise adoption of AI across industries from healthcare to manufacturing and robotics. The collaboration centers on building industry-specific AI agents that continuously learn and adapt, forming what both companies describe as the foundation for the next phase of the AI industrial revolution. The effort will integrate Fujitsu’s Monaka Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Nvidia’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) via NVLink Fusion, enabling more specialized systems than general-purpose architectures can provide. Also Read: Nvidia Becomes The $4.5 Trillion Giant Driving AI’s Biggest Deals “Fujitsu’s strategic collaboration with NVIDIA will accelerate AI-driven business transformation in enterprise and government sectors. By combining the cutting-edge technologies of both companies, we will develop and provide full-stack AI infrastructure, starting with sectors such as manufacturing where Japan is a global leader. To further support the expanding needs of AI infrastructure, Fujitsu and NVIDIA will expand this partnership in the areas of high-performance computing and quantum,” said Fujitsu CEO Takahito Tokita. “The AI industrial revolution has begun, and we must build the infrastructure to power it, in Japan and across the globe. Fujitsu is a true pioneer in computing and Japan’s trusted leader in supercomputing, quantum research, and enterprise systems. Together, NVIDIA and Fujitsu are connecting and extending our ecosystems to forge a powerful partnership for the era of AI,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang added. Fujitsu framed the collaboration against a backdrop of rising demand for generative AI, where high costs and technical hurdles have kept adoption largely confined to major corporations. The company said the partnership is designed to address those barriers by creating scalable infrastructure that balances performance, security, and enterprise autonomy. The deal comes as Nvidia continues to ride surging demand for its GPUs, which underpin most of the world’s cutting-edge AI systems. The company’s stock has surged 41% year-to-date, far outpacing the Nasdaq 100 index’s 19% gain. Earlier this week, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4.5 trillion market capitalization, underscoring its central role in the AI boom. Price Action: NVDA stock was trading higher by 0.55% to $189.92 premarket at last check Friday. Read Next: Photo by Evolf via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: Spiritans adding to suffering of survivors of sex abuse in their schools, says advocacy group
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/10/03/spiritans-adding-to-suffering-of-survivors-of-sex-abuse-in-their-schools-says-advocacy-group/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T11:16:54Z
Full Content:
The Spiritan religious order has been accused of adding to the suffering of survivors abused in their schools through ongoing delays in announcing a redress scheme. The Restore Together group, which represents survivors of abuse in Blackrock College, Willow Park School, Rockwell College in Tipperary, along with St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, accused the order of a “lack of urgency” in the matter. By November last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. In a statement on Friday, Restore Together said the Spiritan order last June issued a public statement about making plans to commence a redress scheme for victims or survivors of abuse suffered at Spiritan schools. It said the order hoped to have an update by “the end of the summer”. The group said the Spiritans had not made any statement and since the end of the summer and it had been seeking a meeting with the Spiritans “to discuss urgently progressing the agreed restorative programme, but to no avail”. [ Spiritans’ promise of redress must be ‘substantiated by actions’, says abuse survivors groupOpens in new window ] This “lack of urgency is seen and felt as a further abuse of victims/survivors, one of control, by the order that abused them sexually decades ago”, the group said, adding that the Spiritans have had “more than enough time to properly address it”. In the meantime victims, survivors and their families “continue to suffer trauma daily”. This “ongoing lack of urgency” on the Spiritans’ part is “not acceptable to victims/survivors, their families and friends or Restore Together”. It called for the timely delivery of “the full programme the Spiritans have signed up” for. Otherwise, the groups said, its benefit “will be diluted, or even lost if people are made to wait too long and fight for every element of it”. [ Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victimsOpens in new window ] The group said it has been more than four years since Restore Together first engaged with the Spiritans on this, while it is “three years since we launched the Restorative Process Framework with them”. It noted that most victims and survivors are “60 or older and have carried this burden for decades”. Last June, in an open letter to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritan congregation, Provincial Fr Brendan Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. It was his “sincere hope”, Fr Carr said then, that by the end of the summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. In response to queries from The Irish Times, a spokesman for the Spiritans said they would “not be comment” on the latest Restore Together statement.

Title: BTC, Gold Jump as Shutdown Delays Data, Fuels Rate-Cut Bets: Crypto Daybook Americas

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$124,035.75 may be entering a decisive phase as macro and crypto-specific forces converge. With the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900. The shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data. “Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. Lower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance. "October has historically been a bullish month for bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception." said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. "Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.” On-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July, according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024. On top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing. “Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk. “A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response." Looking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Furloughed federal workers were already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, then came the government shutdown. Frustrated young Trump supporters express what they want to see out of the president. And, Taylor Swift album drops have always been an event; her 12th one was no different. Here's what to know today. Furloughed federal employees won't be paid until Congress passes legislation to fund the government. And with neither side showing signs of budging as the shutdown enters its third day, some federal employees say they are "sad," "scared" and "afraid." While most of the furloughed employees won't be allowed to work during the shutdown, others who are deemed essential — such as members of the military and airport security screeners — will continue working without pay. Federal workers typically receive back pay once the government reopens, but that requires congressional approval. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. In addition to the uncertainty around paychecks, the Trump administration has threatened to use the shutdown as a pretext to carry out more mass firings. That's left federal workers, already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, scrambling to figure out how to cope with the possibility of weeks without pay and a new round of layoffs, according to nearly two dozen federal workers who reached out to NBC News. The wife of a Department of Homeland Security worker in Ohio said that her bank rejected her request for a deferment on her mortgage. Like nearly all federal employees whom NBC News spoke with, she asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, which has publicly fired federal workers it has deemed as being against its agenda. "I was never afraid to speak my mind before, I never felt afraid to talk. Now, people are afraid," an Arizona TSA worker said, explaining her concerns over speaking publicly about how the shutdown is impacting her. She will have to continue working without pay during the shutdown. Read the full story. President Donald Trump's victory last year was fueled in part by young voters. But new focus groups reveal why some young voters who backed his campaign are beginning to sour on his administration's approach to immigration and the economy. Fourteen swing-state Trump voters under age 30 participated in recent focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 "Deciders" series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago. Nine said they disapproved of Trump's overall job performance so far, while five approved. The group included eight self-identified independents and six Republicans. And while some of the voters in the focus groups detailed concerns about Trump, that didn’t necessarily mean they're inclined to support Democrats. Many of them described the Democratic Party as weak and out of touch. Read the full story. Sean "Diddy" Combs apologized and expressed how "sorry" he was "for all of the hurt and pain" he caused in a letter to the judge set to sentence him on two prostitution-related convictions today. Combs, who faces up to 20 years in prison, also asked for mercy, writing he has "been humbled and broken to my core." The letter marks the first time that Combs has addressed U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian in any meaningful way. During the eight-week federal trial, Combs did not testify and gave brief answers to questions from the judge. Read the full story. Taylor Swift has already broken records with her latest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," being the most pre-saved album ever on Spotify, making her the first female artist to exceed 100 million album sales. The album features a dozen tracks and reunited her with Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, diverging from her good friend Jack Antonoff, who produced her most recent albums. Fans are also expected to flock to movie theaters this weekend to catch "Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl," which the singer described as a "dazzling soirée." The theatrical event will include the premiere of the music video for "The Fate of Ophelia." Read the latest updates on "The Life of a Showgirl" in our liveblog. Perhaps, nobody knows more about how to sound like Trump than Ryan Chen, a social media star from "CHI-na." Though Chen has never set foot in the U.S., he sounds as American as the president himself, nailing Trump's tone, rambling cadence, and the signature hand gestures. In his first U.S. media interview, Chen told NBC News that he posted his first Trump impression video last fall just as a dare. But the clip went viral. So, he just kept going. Chen's popularity continues to grow at home and abroad even amid the U.S.-China trade war. However, Chen said his videos aren't about politics, and he just wants to make people laugh by introducing Chinese food and culture to foreigners in Trump's accent. – Peter Guo, associate producer Still unsure what's actually worth buying during Prime Big Deal Days?

This is a policy break that comes in the middle of Kyiv’s negotiations for long-range strike capacity and missiles. Moscow obviously views this as proof that the U.S. is a direct party to the war, and there will have to be retaliation (most likely asymmetric forms such as cyber, commodity leverage, ground escalation, poking around European borders). For Ukraine, it means precision data on choke-points in Russia’s energy system, designed to maximize disruption. After two and a half years offline, crude from northern Iraq is finally moving again through Ceyhan. The restart comes off a tripartite deal between Baghdad, the KRG, and the key foreign operators in Erbil: all barrels routed through SOMO, producers compensated at a fixed cost rate, and the arrangement subject to monthly renewals through year-end. Early flows are reported around 180-190,000 bpd, well below pipeline nameplate but significant enough to hit crude benchmarks. Turkey, long resistant over the ICC arbitration ruling that saddled it with $1.5 billion in damages, signed off once it secured leverage of its own: proposals to build four refineries in northern Iraq and carve out a role beyond transit. Ankara also benefits from restored fees… Politics, Geopolitics & Conflict Washington has greenlit intelligence support for Ukrainian strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, in a package deal that includes intel on refineries, pipelines, and power plants deep inside Russia, not just on the front lines. This is a policy break that comes in the middle of Kyiv’s negotiations for long-range strike capacity and missiles. Moscow obviously views this as proof that the U.S. is a direct party to the war, and there will have to be retaliation (most likely asymmetric forms such as cyber, commodity leverage, ground escalation, poking around European borders). For Ukraine, it means precision data on choke-points in Russia’s energy system, designed to maximize disruption. After two and a half years offline, crude from northern Iraq is finally moving again through Ceyhan. The restart comes off a tripartite deal between Baghdad, the KRG, and the key foreign operators in Erbil: all barrels routed through SOMO, producers compensated at a fixed cost rate, and the arrangement subject to monthly renewals through year-end. Early flows are reported around 180-190,000 bpd, well below pipeline nameplate but significant enough to hit crude benchmarks. Turkey, long resistant over the ICC arbitration ruling that saddled it with $1.5 billion in damages, signed off once it secured leverage of its own: proposals to build four refineries in northern Iraq and carve out a role beyond transit. Ankara also benefits from restored fees and influence as a corridor state, while quietly betting that U.S. pressure to ease global supply tightness will insulate it from the legal overhang. The real drivers of the breakthrough were Baghdad’s fiscal need for revenues, Erbil’s economic desperation, and Washington’s insistence on de-bottlenecking northern exports. For now, the flows are real but not at capacity, the companies are only partially back on board, and the framework is fragile. Each 30-day renewal cycle will become a bargaining round, with arrears, revenue-sharing, and arbitration liabilities still hanging over the corridor. DNO and Genel have not fully re-entered the new Baghdad–Erbil export framework, leaving Kurdistan’s flows below potential. Both firms continue producing but are diverting much of their crude into the local market rather than nominating volumes to SOMO for pipeline export. Output is being throttled (some wells left under-utilized, drilling programs paused, and operational ramp-ups on hold) a deliberate tactic to preserve leverage. Their arrears, estimated near a billion dollars, remain unpaid, and the new contract terms cap returns at a flat per-barrel service fee, far below the profit-oil model they previously operated under. With the export agreement only running on 30-day renewals through year-end, DNO and Genel are signaling they won’t sink fresh capital or restore plateau volumes until arrears and terms are resolved. The net effect is that Ceyhan flows are restarting at ~180-190 kbpd instead of approaching the 400+ kbpd capacity, highlighting that without these two operators’ full participation, northern exports will remain constrained and the political settlement fragile. The Kremlin is pushing hard against EU plans to tap frozen Russian assets, calling it theft and warning of retaliation. Brussels is weighing whether to use only the windfall interest or move toward seizing principal, with Washington pressing for the latter. Moscow is framing this as a direct attack on the sanctity of reserve holdings, with obvious implications for non-aligned states watching how safe their own money is in Western banks. Countermeasures are already being floated — expropriation of European assets still inside Russia, financial restrictions, commodity leverage. The warning lands just as Brussels debates tighter enforcement on oil sanctions, which only sharpens Moscow’s line that Europe is shifting from financial freeze to outright confiscation. Discovery & Development BP just approved a $5 billion spend on its Tiber–Guadalupe deepwater project in the U.S. Gulf, marking one of its biggest bets there in over a decade. The hub will tie in discoveries, including Tiber (2009) and Guadalupe (2014), targeting ~80,000 bpd at peak with first oil slated for 2032. BP is positioning this as part of its Paleogene push, where Chevron (CVX), Exxon (XOM) and Shell (SHEL) are also advancing high-cost but long-life plays. The move reflects a renewed appetite for mega-projects in the Gulf just as global majors juggle capital discipline with extending oil output. Exxon is trying to revive its Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique, a ~$30 billion development stalled since 2020 by insurgent violence in Cabo Delgado. CEO Darren Woods met this week with President Filipe Nyusi to push for tighter security guarantees so Exxon can restart. FID has now shifted to 2026. Rovuma would export 18 mtpa, bringing Mozambique closer to the status of Qatar and the U.S. as a top LNG supplier if it moves forward. MidOcean Energy, backed by EIG and Saudi Aramco, just bought a 20% stake in Petronas’ upstream gas assets tied to LNG Canada, one of the biggest export projects under construction. The deal plugs MidOcean into a 14 mtpa development led by Shell (SHEL) and expected online in 2025–26. LNG Canada is already oversubscribed on volumes, with Phase 2 under study that could double capacity. For Aramco, the move builds exposure to North American LNG just as Asian buyers scramble to lock in long-term supply. India has revealed a natural gas discovery in the Andaman Sea basin, a frontier area long thought to hold sizable untapped reserves. The find is being called a potential game-changer for India’s energy security, with ONGC leading exploration and officials hinting that it could open a new gas province. India imports more than half its gas, so even modest output here could ease the bill and reduce reliance on LNG cargoes. Development will hinge on further appraisal drilling and whether infrastructure can be built to move gas to demand centers on the east coast. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions Berkshire Hathaway just agreed to buy Occidental Petroleum’s OxyChem unit for $9.7B in cash, marking Warren Buffett’s largest acquisition in years. For Oxy (OXY), the sale trims debt after its $55B Anadarko buyout left the balance sheet stretched, while keeping focus on upstream oil and Permian growth. OxyChem is one of North America’s biggest PVC and chlorine producers, so Berkshire is getting a defensive cash-flow engine with long-cycle demand. The deal shows Buffett is still willing to swing big in energy, even as Oxy doubles down on crude. BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners is in late-stage talks to buy AES Corp. in a $38B deal including debt. It would be one of the largest utility takeovers in U.S. history. AES has been building out renewable generation and supplying power to hyperscale data centers, making it a prime target as AI-driven electricity demand soars. For BlackRock, it’s a chance to grab a regulated cash-flow engine with growth optionality in renewables. The deal isn’t final yet, but if sealed, it would underscore how AI is reshaping utility M&A just as fast as it’s reshaping power demand. Tamboran Resources is moving to acquire Falcon Oil & Gas in a ~$172M all-stock deal, consolidating control of Australia’s Beetaloo Basin. The basin is viewed as one of the country’s biggest undeveloped shale gas plays, with Tamboran pushing to unlock LNG export potential as Asian demand rises. Falcon shareholders will get about 10% of the combined group, giving Tamboran full operatorship across key permits. The move is aimed at accelerating drilling scale and positioning Beetaloo as a future competitor to U.S. shale and Qatar LNG. BKV Corp just closed a $370M deal to buy Barnett shale assets from BHP’s old North Texas portfolio, adding ~300 MMcfe/d of production. The Barnett is mature but still cash-flowing, and BKV (already one of the top U.S. private gas producers) is betting it can squeeze more value through efficiency and scale. The acquisition lifts BKV’s footprint in the play to nearly 500,000 net acres. It’s another sign that while big publics chase LNG-linked growth, privates are still finding bargains in legacy shale gas. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Bitcoin Supercycle? Jeff Park Says Gold’s $1 Trillion Gains Could Spark It
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-supercycle-jeff-park-gold-1-trillion/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T10:15:14Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a wide-ranging interview with Anthony Pompliano published on October 2, Jeff Park, partner and Chief Investing Officer at ProCap BTC, argued that gold’s surging price and shifting global ownership patterns are not a threat to Bitcoin—but potentially the catalyst for its next structural leg higher. Park’s thesis centers on flows, geopolitics, and balance-sheet mechanics: if policymakers and large allocators learn to tap the paper gains embedded in sovereign gold holdings, they could redirect a meaningful slice of that liquidity into Bitcoin and ignite what he repeatedly framed as a supercycle. “The math is pretty simple,” Park said. “What if we find a way to unlock the ability to build leverage on the paper gains of gold to take a call option on Bitcoin? There’s something incredible here that could happen.” In his back-of-the-envelope scenario, “a trillion dollars of Bitcoin is actually hugely impactful for the bitcoin market.” He contrasted the magnitude of such an impulse with the size of the US fiscal problem, suggesting that while a trillion dollars is small relative to public debt, it would be outsized in a young asset with finite supply and thin free float. Park’s remarks were prompted by a simple question: why is gold ripping while Bitcoin has lagged on a relative basis? He did not dispute gold’s leadership—calling it “the story of the year”—but argued the drivers differ. Gold is presently the venue for acute geopolitical expression and central-bank rebalancing, while Bitcoin’s adoption curve hinges on institutional flows that are still ramping. “Ultimately [these markets] are driven by flows,” he said, adding that Bitcoin’s flows are “inevitable” so long as the institutional agenda advances with “focused deliberation.” A crucial plank of Park’s framework is the changing geography of gold. He pointed to two simultaneous realities: the headline that US gold reserves have reached a large notional value because of price—and the under-discussed fact that the US share of global official gold has sunk over decades. “At one point post-World War II the US had over 50% of the world’s global gold reserve supply as a central bank and now it’s less than 20%. So who’s making up for the compensation on their side? Likely China and many other BRIC countries in the lead.” That shift, Park argued, helps explain the persistence of gold’s bid. China, in his telling, is exerting influence not only through accumulation but also by building market infrastructure. He highlighted “the launch of the Shanghai Gold Exchange” and the rise of “the Shanghai Futures Exchange,” observing that “physical gold now actually trades in China” at a scale once associated with London. In a symbolic move earlier this year, “for the first time [they] opened up vaults in Hong Kong to allow offshore investors to put their gold in reserves,” a step Park sees as part of a longer-term strategy to enhance the creditworthiness of CNY-settled commodity trade. Park then connected this gold realignment to Bitcoin’s addressable demand. He referred to the scenario in which the US takes the massive unrealized gains on its gold if marked at market and either revalues or borrows against those gains to purchase Bitcoin for its strategic reserve under President Donald Trump. “Gold has been marked at the Treasury at $42 an ounce and we all know right now it’s trading at [roughly] 3850… There’s a trillion dollars of basically paper gains.” In that context, he argued that leveraging paper gains into a scarce digital reserve asset could be a high-beta upgrade to the sovereign balance sheet. Pressed on the political feasibility, Park distinguished between executive action and legislation. “The executive path is a great starting point to create a watershed moment,” he said, but “no democratic coalition is truly bought in until a legislative motion.” The former could demonstrate intent; the latter would make a Bitcoin reserve strategy “irreversible” and align it with the broader social mandate he associates with sound-money adoption. The crux of his “supercycle” framing is compounding. Park walked through return profiles to quantify why a large base allocation, even if financed, could matter over time. “If you own Bitcoin and you assume that it’s going to go up by 12% a year, you’ll make a 30x in 30 years… If you think it’s actually going to go up by 40% per year, which is what the [asset] has been otherwise annualizing, it’s 10 years.” He stressed that the point is not to promise those numbers, but to illustrate how modest annualized returns can cover meaningful fiscal gaps when the base is large enough and the asset is credibly scarce. Park also addressed why Bitcoin has not matched gold’s recent pace. Part of the answer, he suggested, is optics: Bitcoin is “living, breathing software” that evolves via open debate, whereas gold’s appeal is its millennia-long immutability. The transparency of Bitcoin’s governance can spook newcomers who only see the noise. “If I were outside and I was a BlackRock ETF buyer and I listened to the conversation that’s happening between the Bitcoin developers, I might say, ‘Hold on a second. This is crazy stuff.’” Even so, he framed current developer disputes—such as arguments over relay policy or spam-filter defaults—as hygiene issues, not existential ones. They matter for performance and propagation, but not for the core monetary assurances: “21 million or bust.” He invoked the lessons of the block-size war to explain why the system’s checks and balances are a feature, not a bug. “Ultimately, who is running consensus at Bitcoin?… The node clients are very valuable and they are in control versus miners and their self-interests. And that was a huge moment because it showed you decentralization was alive.” The line between hard-coded rules and socially enforced norms will always invite argument, he conceded, but in his view that process “future-proof[s] Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value.” Throughout, Park returned to flows. Gold’s flows, in his assessment, are being pulled by geopolitics and central-bank behavior—especially in Asia. Bitcoin’s flows will be pulled by institutional adoption and, potentially, by policy innovation that converts dormant balance-sheet strength into active demand. That is why he sees the assets as complements within the same macro problem set rather than rivals fighting for a single inflow. “Gold’s greatest cultural power is its impermanent fixture in our mindset and its durability for eons,” he said. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers sovereignty, portability, and programmability that younger cohorts find intuitive. “Young people are mentally more able to do things that older people can’t… the trend of young people understanding digital store of wealth… is the big picture.” I spoke with @dgt10011 on whether we should be worried about bitcoin lagging gold’s performance, durability of bitcoin vs gold, how to think about bitcoin as living software, and a new theme referencing the retardification of society. Enjoy! YouTube: https://t.co/kwCRnibemU… pic.twitter.com/0BckI7h7Eb — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) October 3, 2025 If that generational shift meets a government-level balance-sheet pivot, Park believes the market structure can change quickly. “A trillion dollars of Bitcoin is hugely impactful,” he repeated, not because it solves everything overnight, but because it reorganizes incentives for issuers, custodians, and policymakers around a credibly scarce digital reserve. In that world, the present period—where gold leads and Bitcoin consolidates—may be remembered not as divergence, but as staging. “Bitcoin will catch up,” Park said. “These are ultimately driven by flows.” And if those flows are seeded by the very gold rally now commanding headlines, the supercycle label he’s willing to use may not be hyperbole, but simply a description of how compounding works when new liquidity finally meets hard caps.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. It is pertinent to mention that Senators Grassley and Durbin have been vocal critics of the H-1B visa programme and have consistently contended that these visas are being abused by many to replace US workers with cheaper labour from overseas. In fact, just a few days after their missive to the ten companies, the senators said they are reintroducing bipartisan legislation to "reform and close loopholes" in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act targets fraud and abuse in US immigration system, provides protection for American workers and visa holders and enhances transparency in the foreign worker recruitment process, the two argued. "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the US on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions." On TCS, the statement noted that the company recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. "In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favour of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders," it said. It further said Cognizant Technology Solutions laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the US. "In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favoured South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages," it added. E-mails sent to TCS and Cognizant for comments by PTI did not elicit a response. The statement by Grassley and Durbin noted that Amazon laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Google, it said, laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 per cent of its small team managers "despite enjoying records profits". In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees, the statement observed. According to it, Meta laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labelled it a "year of efficiency". "In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five per cent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees," it said. Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees in fiscal year 2025, as per the statement. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits, it said adding amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterised its actions as an "enigma of success".

Title: How Microsoft Stock Rises 2x To $1,000

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. We are fond of companies that generate cash. A lot of cash. What about 2% of market capitalization? Microsoft’s stock is valued at $3.9 trillion and generated $71.6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025, which is about 1.8% of its market capitalization. On a per-share basis, that’s $9.60 of free cash flow for a $520 stock. What’s not to adore? This cash accumulates on the balance sheet, can be reinvested, and fuels buybacks. Microsoft’s operating cash flow margin is at 48.3%, resulting in $136 billion from $282 billion in revenue. Net income? An astonishing $102 billion – a net margin of approximately 36%, marking the inaugural occasion that Microsoft surpassed the $100 billion profit threshold. The balance sheet resembles a fortress, boasting $95 billion in cash compared to $61 billion in debt, indicating a robust net cash position. Simultaneously, Microsoft returned $37 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks within the last twelve months alone. See – Why Microsoft Stock Is A Shareholder’s Paradise? – for additional insights. Although Microsoft stock has experienced a strong year, appreciating by 24% and surpassing the NASDAQ’s 18% gain, the crucial question now is: Is there still room for Microsoft stock to grow? An in-depth examination of the company's fundamentals indicates that the answer is yes, as growth is swiftly accelerating. Microsoft reported impressive results for fiscal year 2025, with revenue and operating income rising in the mid to high teens. A key contributor to this performance is the Intelligent Cloud segment. Azure alone surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, exhibiting remarkable growth of 34% year-over-year. Artificial Intelligence (AI) services are a major tailwind, accounting for 19 percentage points of that growth. The company is sustained by several massive, long-term growth drivers—most notably, the expansion of its AI offerings. These factors are anticipated to drive the stock to significantly higher levels, potentially doubling from its current price to exceed $1,000. We will delve into these specific growth drivers in greater detail. That being said, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like Microsoft, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is this the case? The HQ Portfolio stocks as a group have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; showcasing less volatility, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What’s Next For CoreWeave Stock? Let’s analyze the figures. Microsoft generated $281.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, showing an accelerating growth trend. With AI adoption driving sustained annual revenue growth of 17% and margin expansion through operational leverage, sales could reach $450 billion by 2028. Microsoft’s operating margins are expected to expand to 50% as high-margin AI services scale up and operational efficiency improves. This equates to roughly $225 billion in operating income, or about $180 billion in net income after taxes. With ongoing share repurchases decreasing the float, the share count could trend toward 7.2 billion shares. This would imply an EPS of around $25 per share by 2028. Now, let’s discuss valuation. While Microsoft currently trades at 38 times trailing earnings (based on fiscal 2025 results), its AI monetization narrative justifies a premium valuation. Given Microsoft’s robust growth, superior margins, and strong cash flow generation, we do not expect any significant compression in multiples over the next three years. Despite Microsoft’s promising outlook, potential risks could impede the stock from doubling. The most significant concern is the normalization of AI spending, where businesses may become more cautious about initiating new Azure projects, implying that the current investment pace may not be sustainable indefinitely. Additionally, heightened competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging entities could exert pressure on Microsoft’s AI pricing power and market share growth. See, investing in a single stock without a thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive method to maximize gains during favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Microsoft's investment appeal is compelling. Record cash generation of $72 billion and an indomitable balance sheet finance both aggressive AI infrastructure investments and steady shareholder returns, while diverse exposure across cloud, AI, enterprise software, and gaming diminishes risk and positions the company for continued long-term growth. The anticipated $70 billion AI infrastructure investment fosters competitive advantages that enhance market share growth, with additional upside potential arising from AI-driven margin expansion while sustaining accelerating growth. That said, investors should judiciously consider the risks prior to investing in Microsoft.

Title: Unmanned Ground Vehicles Strategic Intelligence Report 2025: Expansion, M&A Activities, and R&D Initiatives are Crucial for Capitalizing on Emerging UGV Capabilities

October 03, 2025 05:52 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence - Unmanned Ground Vehicles" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report explores emergent trends within the UGV market, examining use cases and the implementation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote sensors, and what challenges must be considered in pursuing effective strategies for brand building in this market.UGVs are finally making a mark in modern warfare, and their use can have severe strategic and financial consequences. To overcome developmental hurdles, companies, nations, and militaries are increasingly adopting a collaborative approach. This approach involves public and private investment in the sector and constant experimentation in Ukraine.Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been a distant second thought for those thinking about the future of unmanned warfare. Indeed, Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), but until recently, UGVs have rarely been mentioned. Yet warfare drives innovation, and the UGV sector has been developed by Ukrainian fighters seeking to manage personnel shortages. Since the start of that war, the use of UGVs for logistical, engineering, surveillance, and combat support roles has exploded, and Ukraine now plans to deliver 15,000 ground robots for combat use by the end of 2025. While it is important to recognize that UGVs still account for a fraction of the total of unmanned support in conflicts, the utility of UGVs has at long last been exploited by those on the battlefield. Modern UGVs are now suitable for a wide variety of defense and security applications beyond the traditionally limited scope of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), with nations including China, France, India, Russia, the UK, and the US developing logistics, ISR, and combat-capable UGV platforms.To capitalize on the growth of the UGV market, key industry players have been investing heavily in expanding their research, development, and manufacturing capabilities, with both established defense primes like Rheinmetall and KMW as well as emerging players such as EDGE Group engaging in mergers and acquisitions of specialist firms within the UGV supply chain to pre-emptively secure market shares in an emerging capability sector. Firms with expertise in associated technologies such as AI, weapons systems, mobility solutions, and power supply/management will also benefit from growing demand as the diversified applications for UGVs provide new opportunities to engage with primes and forge strategic partnerships to cement their positions within the supply chain.Studies of emerging technological trends and their broader impact on the defense market.Analysis of the various unmanned ground vehicle programs and projects currently under development, as well as the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence on the future outlook of the unmanned ground vehicles theme.Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/3bitvn About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: How posting on TikTok helped this 22-year-old land a software engineering role at Amazon after a yearlong job hunt

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, Andrew Chen couldn't stop thinking about the ticking clock. He was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. Then a glimmer of hope landed in his inbox: an email from Amazon inviting him to interview for a software engineering role in 10 days. He knew he couldn't waste the opportunity, so he made a plan: hole up in his room to study — and document his preparation for the big day on TikTok to hold himself accountable. "I canceled all my social obligations, locked myself in my room, and basically only left the house to have lunch," said the 22-year-old. "I was thinking, if I don't get this job, this is all for nothing." Chen is among the many recent college graduates who have struggled to find work. As of June, the most recent data available, 4.8% of Americans ages 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor's degree were unemployed — higher than the 4.0% jobless rate among the broader working-age population, a reversal from the typical trend in recent decades. These challenges reflect a broader hiring slowdown that's hit entry-level job seekers especially hard. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are hiring at one of the slowest paces since 2014. Tech professionals, including computer science graduates like Chen, have been particularly affected, with layoffs at firms including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. On Indeed, US software development job postings have declined by over 70% from their peak in 2022. While some new graduates are still searching, others, like Chen, have used creative job-search and interview preparation strategies to secure offers. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above — or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com (or Signal at jzinkula.29). You can also find more of our job market coverage below: Chen began looking for a full-time job in the summer of 2024. As a computer science major, he'd always envisioned starting his career in software engineering. But after applying to more than 400 jobs and struggling to gain traction, he expanded his search to include product management and design roles. But he didn't give up on software engineering. Between September 2024 and early February 2025, Chen applied to several software engineering roles at Amazon. In mid-February, he was asked to complete an online assessment for one of the roles he had applied to — he's still unsure exactly which one — that included a coding test and behavioral questions. He thought he had done well — news he excitedly shared with his parents — but as the months passed, he never received an update about his application status. "My parents would keep asking for updates on Amazon because it's a name brand," he said. "And I eventually told them I got rejected — I thought if I hadn't heard from them after months, it's probably not going to happen." By the time Amazon reached out in May, Chen said he was deep in interviews for product management and design roles — and had nearly given up on software engineering entirely. The unexpected opportunity to return to his preferred field was welcome, but its timing posed a challenge. After focusing on other types of roles, he'd largely stopped practicing his coding skills and would need to quickly brush up before the interview. Chen had just 10 days to prepare — and still had to carve out time for interviews with other companies, in addition to school exams and final projects. So he developed a plan of attack, dividing his days into blocks for coding practice on LeetCode, behavioral prep, and studying for other interviews. He set out to read everything he could on platforms like Reddit and Blind about Amazon's interview process and past candidates' experiences, practice common technical questions, study the company's leadership principles, and memorize STAR-format personal stories that illustrated how he embodied those values. "This was the first big company that had given me a chance in a while," he said, "so I really wanted to get this one." But pulling this all off seemed daunting, and Chen felt he needed something to help him stay motivated. Then he had an idea. He'd been interested in creating social media content for a while but had only posted a handful of TikToks. What if he started documenting his preparation for the Amazon interview? Sharing updates publicly on TikTok, he figured, would add the kind of pressure he needed to stay locked in — and maybe even attract advice from others who'd been through the process. On May 19, Chen posted a TikTok with the caption "10 days until FAANG final interview," sharing how much prep he'd done, how many classes he'd skipped, how much caffeine he'd consumed, and how many showers he'd taken. He followed it with similar updates in the days that followed. Chen said his videos — which received as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions, including skepticism that he could land the role given his limited preparation time. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," he said. When interview day arrived in late May, Chen was anxious and sleep-deprived. He said his Amazon "loop" interview process consisted of three back-to-back virtual interviews with short breaks in between. The first round focused on technical questions, the second on behavioral scenarios tied to Amazon's leadership principles, and the third included a mix of both. "I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed," he said. Chen gradually settled in as the day went on and left the interviews feeling like he'd done his best. On June 3, shortly after finishing his third interview of the day for non-Amazon roles, he saw an email notification on his phone. He'd received an offer from Amazon with a six-figure salary. On June 5, Chen posted a TikTok with the news that received over 941,000 views. He graduated in mid-June and, after moving to New York City, started working full-time in July. Chen said his biggest takeaway from the Amazon interviews was the company's emphasis on behavioral questions tied to its leadership principles — something he felt played to his strengths. "They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise," he said. "I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that." One of his top pieces of advice for job seekers: while application quality matters, volume is essential in a tough market. "Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game," he said. "You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for." Jump to

Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our expanded daily Links Yves here. This is a devastating, must-read paper by Servaas Storm on how AI is failing to meet core, repeatedly hyped performance promises, and never can, irrespective of how much money and computing power is thrown at it. Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” is still garnering worse-than-dot-com-frenzy valuations even as errors are if anything increasing. By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website This paper argues that (i) we have reached “peak GenAI” in terms of current Large Language Models (LLMs); scaling (building more data centers and using more chips) will not take us further to the goal of “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI); returns are diminishing rapidly; (ii) the AI-LLM industry and the larger U.S. economy are experiencing a speculative bubble, which is about to burst. The U.S. is undergoing an extraordinary AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to exceptionally high valuations of AI-related tech firms, which are fueling economic growth by the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars they are spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels. But the summer of 2025 did not bring good news for enthusiasts of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) who were all hyped up by the inflated promise of the likes of OpenAI’s Sam Altman that “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI), the holy grail of current AI research, would be right around the corner. Let us more closely consider the hype. Already in January 2025, Altman wrote that “we are now confident we know how to build AGI”. Altman’s optimism echoed claims by OpenAI’s partner and major financial backer Microsoft, which had put out a paper in 2023 claiming that the GPT-4 model already exhibited “sparks of AGI.” Elon Musk (in 2024) was equally confident that the Grok model developed by his company xAI would reach AGI, an intelligence “smarter than the smartest human being”, probably by 2025 or at least by 2026. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that his company was committed to “building full general intelligence”, and that super-intelligence is now “in sight”. Likewise, Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said “powerful AI”, i.e., smarter than a Nobel Prize winner in any field, could come as early as 2026, and usher in a new age of health and abundance — the U.S. would become a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”, if ….. AI didn’t wind up killing us all. For Mr. Musk and his GenAI fellow travelers, the biggest hurdle on the road to AGI is the lack of computing power (installed in data centers) to train AI bots, which, in turn, is due to a lack of sufficiently advanced computer chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would exceed the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. Spurred by the imperative to win the AI-race with China, the GenAI propagandists firmly believe that the U.S. can be put on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City of AGI by building more data centers faster (an unmistakenly “accelerationist” expression). Interestingly, AGI is an ill-defined notion, and perhaps more of a marketing concept used by AI promotors to persuade their financiers to invest in their endeavors. Roughly, the idea is that an AGI model can generalize beyond specific examples found in its training data, similar to how some human beings can do almost any kind of work after having been shown a few examples of how to do a task, by learning from experience and changing methods when needed. AGI bots will be capable of outsmarting human beings, creating new scientific ideas, and doing innovative as well as all of routine coding. AI bots will be telling us how to develop new medicines to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our genetically modified crops. Hence, in a radical bout of creative destruction, AGI would transform not just the economy and the workplace, but also systems of health care, energy, agriculture, communications, entertainment, transportation, R&D, innovation and science. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go.” He “think[s] we know what to do,” saying that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PhD.” Announcing the launch of ChatGPT-5 in August, Mr. Altman posted on the internet that “We think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous Al. It is useful, it is smart, it is fast [and] intuitive. With GPT-5 now, it’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD level expert in anything any area you need on demand, they can help you with whatever your goals are.” But then things began to fall apart, and rather quickly so. ChatGPT-5 Is a Letdown The first piece of bad news is that much-hyped ChatGPT-5 turned out to be a dud — incremental improvements wrapped in a routing architecture, nowhere near the breakthrough to AGI that Sam Altman had promised. Users are underwhelmed. As the MIT Technology Review reports: “The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it’s still far short of AGI.” Worryingly, OpenAI’s internal tests show GPT-5 ‘hallucinates’ in circa one in 10 responses of the time on certain factual tasks, when connected to the internet. However, without web-browsing access, GPT-5 is wrong in almost 1 in 2 responses, which should be troublesome. Even more worrisome, ‘hallucinations’ may also reflect biases buried within datasets. For instance, an LLM might ‘hallucinate’ crime statistics that align with racial or political biases simply because it has learned from biased data. Of note here is that AI chatbots can be and are actively used to spread misinformation (see here and here). According to recent research, chatbots spread false claims when prompted with questions about controversial news topics 35% of the time — almost double the 18% rate of a year ago (here). AI curates, orders, presents, and censors information, influencing interpretation and debate, while pushing dominant (average or preferred) viewpoints while suppressing alternatives, quietly removing inconvenient facts or making up convenient ones. The key issue is: Who controls the algorithms? Who sets the rules for the tech bros? It is evident that by making it easy to spread “realistic-looking” misinformation and biases and/or suppress critical evidence or argumentation, GenAI does and will have non-negligible societal costs and risks — which have to be counted when assessing its impacts. Building Larger LLMs Is Leading Nowhere The ChatGPT-5 episode raises serious doubts and existential questions about whether the GenAI industry’s core strategy of building ever-larger models on ever-larger data distributions has already hit a wall. Critics, including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus (here and here), have long argued that simply scaling up LLMs will not lead to AGI, and GPT-5’s sorry stumbles do validate those concerns. It is becoming more widely understood that LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching — which is why, for example, they still cannot even play chess reliably and continue to make mind-boggling errors with startling regularity. My new INET Working Paper discusses three sobering research studies showing that novel ever-larger GenAI models do not become better, but worse, and do not reason, but rather parrot reasoning-like text. To illustrate, a recent paper by scientists at MIT and Harvard shows that even when trained on all of physics, LLMs fail to uncover even the existing generalized and universal physical principles underlying their training data. Specifically, Vafa et al. (2025) note that LLMs that follow a “Kepler-esque” approach: they can successfully predict the next position in a planet’s orbit, but fail to find the underlying explanation of Newton’s Law of Gravity (see here). Instead, they resort to fitting made-up rules, that allow them to successfully predict the planet’s next orbital position, but these models fail to find the force vector at the heart of Newton’s insight. The MIT-Harvard paper is explained in this video. LLMs cannot and do not infer physical laws from their training data. Remarkably, they cannot even identify the relevant information from the internet. Instead, they make it up. Worse, AI bots are incentivized to guess (and give an incorrect response) rather than admit they do not know something. This problem is recognized by researchers from OpenAI in a recent paper. Guessing is rewarded — because, who knows, it might be right. The error is at present uncorrectable. Accordingly, it might well be prudent to think of “Artificial Information” rather than “Artificial Intelligence” when using the acronym AI. The bottom line is straightforward: this is very bad news for anyone hoping that further scaling — building ever larger LLMs — would lead to better outcomes (see also Che 2025). 95% of Generative AI Pilot Projects in Companies Are Failing Corporations had rushed to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices. Then came the news that the AI tools are not doing what they are supposed to do and that people are realizing it (see Ed Zitron). An August 2025 report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, concludes that 95% of generative AI pilot projects in companies are failing to raise revenue growth. As reported by Fortune, “generic tools like ChatGPT [….] stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows”. Quite. Indeed, firms are backpedaling after cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing these by AI. For instance, Swedish “Buy Burritos Now, Pay Later” Klarna bragged in March 2024 that its AI assistant was doing the work of (laid-off) 700 workers, only to rehire them (sadly, as gig workers) in the summer of 2025 (see here). Other examples include IBM, forced to reemploy staff after laying off about 8,000 workers to implement automation (here). Recent U.S. Census Bureau data by firm size show that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees. MIT economist Daren Acemoglu (2025) predicts rather modest productivity impacts of AI in the next 10 years and warns that some applications of AI may have negative social value. “We’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees,” Acemoglu says. “It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy.” Similarly, using two large-scale AI adoption surveys (late 2023 and 2024) covering 11 exposed occupations (25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces) in Denmark, Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard (2025) show, in a recent NBER Working Paper, that the economic impacts of GenAI adoption are minimal: “AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation, with confidence intervals ruling out effects larger than 1%. Modest productivity gains (average time savings of 3%), combined with weak wage pass-through, help explain these limited labor market effects.” These findings provide a much-needed reality check for the hyperbole that GenAI is coming for all of our jobs. Reality is not even close. GenAI will not even make tech workers who do the coding redundant, contrary to the prediction by AI enthusiasts. OpenAI researchers have found (in early 2025) that advanced AI models (including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet) still are no match for human coders. The AI bots failed to grasp how widespread bugs are or to understand their context, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. Another new study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) finds that in practice, programmers, using early 2025-AI-tools, are actually slower when using AI assistance tools, spending 19 percent more time when using GenAI than when actively coding by themselves (see here). Programmers spent their time on reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and correcting AI-generated code. The U.S. Economy at Large Is Hallucinating The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use. During 2024 and 2025, Big Tech firms invested a staggering $750 billion in data centers in cumulative terms and they plan to roll out a cumulative investment of $3 trillion in data centers during 2026-2029 (Thornhill 2025). The so-called “Magnificent 7” (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) spent more than $100 billion on data centers in the second quarter of 2025; Figure 1 gives the capital expenditures for four of the seven corporations. FIGURE 1 Christopher Mims (2025), https://x.com/mims/status/1951… The surge in corporate investment in “information processing equipment” is huge. According to Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, data center investments’ contribution to (sluggish) real U.S. GDP growth has been the same as consumer spending over the first half of 2025 (Figure 2). Financial investor Paul Kedrosky finds that capital expenditures on AI data centers (in 2025) have passed the peak of telecom spending during the dot-com bubble (of 1995-2000). FIGURE 2 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025). https://www.apolloacademy.com/… Following the AI hype and hyperbole, tech stocks have gone through the roof. The S&P500 Index rose by circa 58% during 2023-2024, driven mostly by the growth of the share prices of the Magnificent Seven. The weighted-average share price of these seven corporations increased by 156% during 2023-2024, while the other 493 firms experienced an average increase in their share prices of just 25%. America’s stock market is largely AI-driven. Nvidia’s shares rose by more than 280% over the past two years amid the exploding demand for its GPUs coming from the AI firms; as one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the insatiable demand for GenAI, Nvidia now has a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion, which is the highest valuation ever recorded for a publicly traded company. Does this valuation make sense? Nvidia’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio peaked at 234 in July 2023 and has since declined to 47.6 in September 2025 — which is still historically very high (see Figure 3). Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. In key cases, as explained by Ed Zitron, Nvidia offered the neocloud companies, which are loss making, to buy unsold cloud compute worth billions of U.S. dollars, effectively backstopping its clients — all in the expectation of an AI revolution that still has to arrive. Likewise, the share price of Oracle Corp. (which is not included in the “Magnificent 7”) rose by more than 130% during mid-May and early September 2025 following the announcement of its $300 billion cloud-computing infrastructure deal with OpenAI. Oracle’s P/E ratio shot up to almost 68, which means that financial investors are willing to pay almost $68 for $1 of Oracle’s future earnings. One obvious problem with this deal is that OpenAI doesn’t have $300 billion; the company made a loss of $15 billion during 2023-2025 and is projected to make a further cumulative loss of $28 billion during 2026-2028 (see below). It is unclear and uncertain where OpenAI will get the money from. Ominously, Oracle needs to build the infrastructure for OpenAI before it can collect any revenue. If OpenAI cannot pay for the enormous computing capacity it agreed to buy from Oracle, which seems likely, Oracle will be left with the expensive AI infrastructure, for which it may not be able to find alternative customers, especially once the AI bubble fizzles out. Tech stocks thus are considerably overvalued. Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, warned (in July 2025) that AI stocks are even more overvalued than dot-com stocks were in 1999. In a blogpost, he illustrates how P/E ratios of Nvidia, Microsoft and eight other tech companies are higher than during the dot-com era (see Figure 3). We all remember how the dot-com bubble ended — and hence Sløk is right in sounding the alarm over the apparent market mania, driven by the “Magnificent 7” that are all heavily invested in the AI industry. Big Tech does not buy these data centers and operate them itself; instead the data centers are built by construction companies and then purchased by data center operators who lease them to (say) OpenAI, Meta or Amazon (see here). Wall Street private equity firms such as Blackstone and KKR are investing billions of dollars to buy up these data center operators, using commercial mortgage-backed securities as source funding. Data center real estate is a new, hyped-up asset class that is beginning to dominate financial portfolios. Blackstone calls data centers one of its “highest conviction investments.” Wall Street loves the lease-contracts of data centers which offer long-term stable, predictable income, paid by AAA-rated clients like AWS, Microsoft and Google. Some Cassandras are warning of a potential oversupply of data centers, but given that “the future will be based on GenAI”, what could possibly go wrong? FIGURE 3 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025), https://www.apolloacademy.com/… In a rare moment of frankness, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had it right. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a dinner interview with reporters in San Francisco in August. “My opinion is yes.” He also compared today’s AI investment frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think,” Altman said. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money – we don’t know who …”, but (going by what happened in earlier bubbles) it will most likely not be Altman himself. The question therefore is: How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key firms in the GenAI race remains to be seen. Earnings of the AI industry continue to pale in comparison to the tens of billions of U.S. dollars that are spent on data center growth. According to an upbeat S&P Global research note published in June, 2025 the GenAI market is projected to generate $85 billion in revenue 2029. However, Alphabet, Google, Amazon and Meta together will spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone. At the same time, the AI industry has a combined revenue that is little more than the revenue of the smart-watch industry (Zitron 2025). So, what if GenAI just is not profitable? This question is pertinent in view of the rapidly diminishing returns to the stratospheric capital expenditures on GenAI and data centers and the disappointing user-experience of 95% of firms that adopted AI. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, Florida-based Elliott, told clients that AI is overhyped and Nvidia is in a bubble, adding that many AI products are “never going to be cost-efficient, never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” “There are few real uses,” it said, other than “summarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”. It added that it was “skeptical” that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker’s graphics processing units in such high volumes. Locking billions of U.S. dollars in into AI-focused data centers without a clear exit strategy for these investments in case the AI craze ends, only means that systemic risk in finance and the economy is building. With data-center investments driving U.S. economic growth, the American economy has become dependent on a handful of corporations, which have not yet managed to generate one dollar of profit on the ‘compute’ done by these data center investments. America’s High-Stakes Geopolitical Get Gone Wrong The AI boom (bubble) developed with the support of both major political parties in the U.S. The vision of American firms pushing the AI frontier and reaching GenAI first is widely shared — in fact, there is a bipartisan consensus on how important it is that the U.S. should win the global AI race. America’s industrial capability is critically dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China. In this context, America’s lead in GenAI is considered to constitute a potential very powerful geopolitical lever: If America manages to get to AGI first, so the analysis goes, it can build up an overwhelming long-term advantage over especially China (see Farrell). That is the reason why Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the Trump administration are doubling down on the “AGI First” strategy. But astute observers highlight the costs and risks of this strategy. Prominently, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” Schmidt and Xu are rightly worried. Perhaps the plight of the U.S. economy is captured best by OpenAI’s Sam Altman who fantasizes about putting his data centers in space: “Like, maybe we build a big Dyson sphere around the solar system and say, “Hey, it actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.”” For as long as such ‘hallucinations’ on using solar-collecting satellites to harvest (unlimited) star power continue to convince gullible financial investors, the government and users of the “magic” of AI and the AI industry, the U.S. economy is surely doomed. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” Clearly Altman doesn’t know how science is done. I have, for instance, done an AI search on a theme I used to be an expert years ago namely the cell-to-cell-movement of viruses in plants. With google AI what you obtain is a rehash of ideas more or less currently known. Very importantly, it comes without caveats, critical thinking and without any real experimental data already obtained with its experimental context. The first thing a researcher has to do is to be very critical on any data obtained before, conscientious that all that data was obtained in certain experimental conditions which very frequently result in situations in which the functioning of things are altered or controlled. In this sense, many research results are artificial artefacts and the results of research are often misleading and needing more checks and controls. I very well remember a congress (in Capetown 2001) about plasmodesmata , structures that bridge and communicate plant cells. Virus cell-to-cell movement was amongst the main issues in this small, very specialized, meeting. In a session dedicated to this issue there was a researcher exposing a vast body of research the lab had been doing using state-of-the-art methodology. This included data already published (several articles) and in the same line of research new data to be published soon with important conclusions. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. Starting any research with the very redacted rehash of ideas without any kind of critical thinking looks to me the exact recipe for hallucinatory AI-driven research. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. You’ve touched upon what AI boosters are hoping for (AGI) and what the limitations of the current state of affairs are and why humans will be sticking around, especially in knowledge generation fields, for some time still. I remember there being some links here on Naked Capitalism that touched on symbolic computation, and how that got discarded for machine learning/statistical approaches in AI, which were highly successful in tackling computer vision/classification problems, and led to a winter in research in symbolic methods, which researchers are slowly rediscovering will be essential for AGI. In this case, symbolic computation would be invaluable for any type of “thinking machine” to simplify contradictory information into abstract logical terms, recognize they form a contradictory set of statements, and then work around that to identify what could be the cause of contradiction, and how it could be resolved, while recognizing a limitation in its own knowledge set to be able to resolve it. Much of scientific research is dedicated to finding and resolving these contradictions. Phenomenon A predicts X happens in some novel set of circumstances. Phenomenon B predicts Y happens in the same novel set of circumstances. Except in pure mathematics, you can’t ‘reason’ your way through whether A and/or B will fail when tested in those novel circumstances. Likewise as you described, testing a phenomenon A in circumstances X and in presumably the same circumstances X’ generated different results. Reasoning can help identify what may caused different results in this instance, but current LLMs aren’t performing this type of reasoning. Anyone who’s knowledgeable in physics would understand these limitations. We’ve dedicated billions of hours of research into trying to reconcile quantum physics with general relativity, an instance of where two theories cannot be reconciled where both gravitational and quantum effects are significant. Much of that research gave us string theory, but string theory itself suffers from a lack of testable and verifiable circumstances, and also has gaps in certain circumstances. As for the life sciences, I’ve seen AI boosters try to remark that LLMs are extremely advanced, since now they’ve begun creating “designer viruses” or “designer gene therapies” that are engineered to achieve certain therapeutic or other effects. However, I’ve been frustrated to try and explain that first, it didn’t actually engineer it, it only proposed it, or “hallucinated it” as you said. Until it actually gets tested or synthesized in a lab, there might be some underlying principle it ignored in its proposal that will prevent synthesizing it. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs when everyone else catches on that simulating clerical work isn’t that profitable. All of these GPUs and hardware setups are well suited to be adapted into giant protein dynamic simulation clusters. However protein folding doesn’t sound as sexy to Silicon valley investors as replacing human workers. Thank you for your interesting reply Chris. Indeed, computing models are very useful for, for instance, simulating protein dynamics, their folding and changes these undergo under different conditions. There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed for such simulations. The simulations themselves are to be taken with (tons of) grains of salt. Scientists know that these are just simulations. I think that a big effort has been dedicated to obtain improved versions of RUBISCO, the protein that fixes CO2 to be incorporated in organic material and thought to be the most abundant protein in the world (here an example on Machine Learning to accelerate the process). This kind of work is termed in silico analysis. It isn’t obviously experimental. Whether ML will indeed accelerate the process or make it more complicated it is something that has not been readily shown in this case. It might be that other methods based on random procedures are more efficient and faster. Chris N: I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs Of course. That’s exactly what’s happening and biomedical research simulations are one intention. Among others. It’s naive to announce the bleeding obvious, that LLMs can’t hyperscale to more AI or to AGI — whatever that is — as the OP above and many commentators here do as if this were a revelation. Or to point out that LLM-based AI is a bubble. Of course, it is — that’s arguably the business model. The executives running the companies building these giant datacenters almost all went through the dotcom bubble, after all. Ask the next question. (You’re the only person here I’ve seen starting to do that, Chris.) What are they going to do with all that compute besides LLMs? How much compute are we talking about? Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer is El Capitan, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, capable of 2.746 exaFLOPS — https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer). Microsoft is building Fairwater, an AI-focused datecenter in Wisconsin, operational in 2026 that will by comparison supposedly do 17 exaFLOPS and, via massive GPU parallelism, achieve 10x El Capitan’s performance. And this is only one datacenter among others Microsoft is building and which we can presume therefore will get built. (As opposed to speculating, forex, about how much of the Oracle-Softbank-OpenAIStargate effort will come to fruition). So what other kinds of AI architectures can run in such datacenters. Over the next 3 years, here’s some of the roadmap — Large Physics Models (LPMs): Foundation models trained on physics texts, equations, and experimental data, capable of reasoning across scales—from QM to cosmology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): For modeling relational systems like molecules, social networks, or traffic flows, where entities and their interactions evolve dynamically. Neural PDE Solvers: AI systems that learn to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), for simulations in fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and fusion energy. Agent-Based Simulation Models (ABMs): These simulate individual decision-makers (humans, cells, vehicles) whose behaviors evolve based on learned rules, for applications in economics, epidemiology, and urban planning. In 3-7 years’ time, the hope/intent is to leverage this massive datacenter compute to develop neuromorphic computing, which will need massively lower energy inputs (i.e. like the human brain). That way, AI can be pushed out the Edge, as it’s now being referred to, with the Edge meaning autonomous cars, robots, etc. Now, how much of this will happen? Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future. But one other factor needs consideration here: we’ve entered a period of geopolitical conflict, unrest, and war, and war generally accelerates technological development — e.g.the state of things pre-WW2 with biplanes and radio to post-WW2, five years later, with jets, rockets, television, and computers. And this is without the climate threat. So, this could a period of greater technological acceleration than we’ve seen in our lifetimes previously. Who’s they? This GPU compute needs to earn some kind of yield that compensates for the risk undertaken by the investors. And it’s only suitable for a handful of very specialized workloads. Who’s going to pay for this cool-sounding science stuff? Capitalists certainly are not altruistic. They can’t do anything like Uber-for-pets with it. Capitalists aren’t altruistic, but they are greedy, and are willing to invest large amounts of money into things if they think they’ll get a return from them, not because they necessarily or actually will get a return from them. In this case T Rowe price, Vanguard, and every other 401k or pension fund manager is basically putting money into this because of the predicted productivity ramifications from it. I.E. worker output is going to double translates to double value generated, translates to double revenue generated, translates to earnings increasing many times over. However, if that doesn’t materialize, and the bubble pops, there will be all of this hardware left over. Even if the hardware is old, it won’t actually be obsolete. I mentioned folding at home, because many of these types of simulations are embarrassingly parallel computational problems, or those where any computer of any power level can contribute towards calculations. Those GPUs will still be useful for anything that requires a lot of matrix multiplication. This means there will be discount sales for a lot of these data centers, providing opportunities for others companies or investors to buy them up for less than what it would have cost to construct them and buy the hardware new. This is the conspiracy that I’m alluding to: Entrepreneurs can’t pitch a use-biochemical-simulations-to-solve-aging start-up because the time horizon is too long, and initial captial cost too risky to convince non-technical investors to pitch in. But if they can convince them to put money into something that they see a return on, and use that to lower the initial capital cost for their own pet project, they’ll go ahead and do that and fund the entire endeavor for either themselves or their associates interested in those ideas after the crash. As a tangentially related thought, Elizabeth Holmes’ former partner is starting up another medical testing and diagnostics company. A lot of people from the Rational/Less-Wrong Sphere, who came up with Effective Altruism and Long-termism, have a deep cult-like interest in trying to overcome death, either by uploading consciousness into machines, or through mastering genetics and developing therapies to reverse aging. If these individuals lacked scruples to defraud investors via cryptocurrency (See Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX), I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re willing to defraud investors because in their moral calculus, raising lifespans to be 10x longer than they are now is worth it, even if some proportion of the population dies from impoverishment from the bubble crashing, because the net result was positive for the survivors. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. Interesting you mention this, a story in NY Times earlier this week some researchers at OpenAI left to do a startup that takes these kinds of inputs and then claims they’ll have robotic researchers that will actually perform the experimentation itself physically in a lab, presumably a brute force kind of approach to testing. I can only imagine the number of combinations that might need to be tested for any hypothesis. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish; they were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement. PapP: I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish Essentially, with some differences. AlphaFold used a transformer architecture to model relationships between amino acids similiarly to how LLMs model word dependencies and has attention mechanisms that work across both sequence and spatial dimensions, similarly to how LLMs track long-range dependencies in text. Differences were no autoregressive token prediction — AlphaFold doesn’t generate sequences, it infers structures — and optimization for protein folding, not open-ended tasks. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships. Turn an optimized LLM loose on non-semantic data sets and you sometimes get amazing results. ~~ Conversely, giving a free version of ChatGPT semantics-based tasks simply to prove LLMs aren’t really intelligent in order to validate your prior anti-LLM beliefs, as many in the NC commentariat are doing, accomplishes — what? Certainly, it’ll give you the proof that the free LLM system for the masses that you used isn’t intelligent, but just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. But it tells you nothing about what specialized LLMs can achieve at full stretch. So, if you believe it does, who’s the joke on? Because it’s not on the LLM, which is indeed just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships. Turn an optimized LLM loose on non-semantic data sets and you sometimes get amazing results. … Conversely, giving a free version of ChatGPT semantics-based tasks simply to prove LLMs aren’t really intelligent in order to validate your prior anti-LLM beliefs, as many in the NC commentariat are doing, accomplishes — what? This got me thinking about Kurt Gödel and his Numbering System as applied to LLM architecture with regards to patterns/tokens; these are axiomatic systems govern by simple rules woven together into a regression. So if this is the case, then this is an at least formal-like system and will be ultimately be Incomplete even if you account for the largest vocabulary/library of everything ever written (the totality of the Library of Babel from Jorge Borges comes to mind). So is this chase for AGI a fool’s errand if we can’t even prove AGI on a formal level? What does this say about us on a formal level? Maybe we can relate to this other ontological thing as a fellow confused pattern-recognizing being? Not equal but different. Regarding the replacement of journalists i believe that there are some of a kind who can be easily replaced by AI. Those whose work consists on following a script and who are so frequently and sadly found in MSM. AI can probably do it more reliably. In fact they probably use AI tools to write their articles. Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. I think it’s worth pointing out here that these GPUs go obsolete in 6-12 months, so their value drops sharply. Their collateral is like fresh fish. They have to hold on to it, but it will inevitably make a huge stink. Obsolete does not mean useless. Machines that are not state of the art still work and can perform functions that do not require the latest and greatest hardware. However, in a hyper competitive environment, everyone naturally wants to be at the cutting edge. Obsolete means useless as debt collateral, since the asset loses much of its value. It seems that with computer operating systems software (OS), the free & open source (FOSS) Linux has proven to be superior to non-FOSS/closed OS software like Windows. What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI? If no AI/LLM software is producing the hyped extreme productivity breakthroughs, wouldn’t there be an incentive globally in most nations to use or make limited propietary modifications on DeepSeek instead of the US closed software alternatives. Especially if it is the case that DeepSeek can provide similar quality models with 10% of Meta’s AI software’s computing power. Any computer scientists or financial analysts/economists focused on the InfoTech sector have a take on how a FOSS software like DeepSeek will influence future AI development? “What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI?” Sure thing bro, just search for “running deep seek on raspberry pi and you’ll get a long list of how to do it and many examples of it running. Raspberry is a very cheap one board computer that runs linux. https://www.hackster.io/ElecrowOfficial/how-to-run-deepseek-on-a-raspberry-pi-5-step-by-step-guide-c2c790 There’s a big difference between what FOSS can do and what it does do. Mostly the difference between what a motivated individual wants and what a pointy haired boss wants. ProNewerDeal claims Linux is superior (I agree, personally), but that hasn’t budged the needle on desktop market share, has it? Sure, you can shoehorn a LLM onto a Pi (it’ll run like molasses in January), but what CEO is going to boast about that to a quarterly analyst conference call? The CapEx orgy is hype driven, not performance driven (duh). This is an apples / oranges question. The real worry is that the current AI ‘productivity’ hype was a head fake to fund the infrastructure, and the real goal is to get everyone hooked on AI (a la Facebook/TicTok), dumb down the population, grab Google’s advertising money firehose and end up owning the mother of all Big Brother propaganda engines. I recently stumbled into some on-line drama about how the latest OpenAI model was messing with paying customer’s feels, by routing “dangerous or emotional” prompts to a safer model which was heavy on the warnings, and offering up information about self harm hotlines and such, rather than playing along like the previous model. Oh the humanity! I gather that paying customers can select the older model, but there’s real-time “psychological analysis” of your prompts so if it judges that you’re veering into dangerous territory, it routes to a newer, safer model. And let me tell you, THEY DONT LIKE IT! From my 30 minute climb down that rabbit hole, I came to the conclusion that there’s already a lot of people well on their way to the LLM addiction you mentioned in your last paragraph. It may not be plain jane FOSS, but Linux derivatives are being used by the biggest of big boys: Inside Google‘s Data Centers: The Operating Systems Powering Google‘s Global Infrastructure https://expertbeacon.com/inside-googles-data-centers-the-operating-systems-powering-googles-global-infrastructure/ Google‘s servers predominantly run customized versions of the open source Linux operating system that have been tuned and hardened for Google‘s unique technical environment. Rather than rely on standard “off-the-shelf” Linux distributions, Google‘s engineering team has modified and secured the Linux kernel and userspace tools to create server operating systems tailored for massive server fleets running containerized workloads. This journey to create a highly optimized server OS began nearly two decades ago and continues to evolve today. In Google‘s early days in the late 1990s, its initial fleet of servers ran a modified version of the Red Hat Linux distribution. However, as the scale and complexity of Google‘s infrastructure increased, its engineers began customizing the OS to meet its specific technical and operational needs. In 2006, Google started work on “goobuntu”, its own in-house distribution of the Debian-based Ubuntu Linux OS [1]. Goobuntu was used for Google‘s corporate desktops and also some of its production servers. For its larger server fleet, Google hardened and slimmed down the Linux distribution even further, removing extraneous packages and attack surfaces. This more spartan Linux system used an in-house software distribution and management tool called Midas. In the 2010s, Google began migrating servers to its latest generation custom Linux distribution known as gLinux [2]. The article also mentions that Linux derivatives are used by Amazon and Facebook. Admittedly, using a Pi for an LLM is probably not going to work too well, but AMD’s latest high end laptop CPUs are bringing some real heat if you want to do LLM at home: Linux on the New Framework Desktop PC! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZDzrDI7AM That’s definitely NOT a cheap PC, but the LLM performance is pretty astonishing even at that price point. Overall though, I agree that AI is way, way over hyped for what it’s actually doing. But strangely, AI in other countries (at least one other country) is actually doing some pretty amazing stuff: China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 China is already a powerhouse in AI for radiology and medical imaging. Next they’re going global. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RJlqhYt2XQ AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites, but it’s a dream that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Glen: AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites .. that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Yes. The trend is broadly recapitulating nuclear, which American capitalism — where corporate elites had to be served and profit before all else — also screwed up. Also, automobiles. Also, airliners (e.g. current Boeing failures). Don’t quote Silicon Valley at me, because that was built on Pentagon money; in 1960, 100 percent of all microprocessor chips it produced were bought by the DoD for ICBM guidance systems and early-warning radar networks like NORAD; as late as 1967, 75 percent of all chips from Silicon Valley were still going to the DoD. It took the Japanese to pioneer transistor/chip based electronic consumer appliances — computer tech for the civilian masses — not the Americans. Thanks for this excellent article. Indeed, the whole idea that LLMs are going to lead to AGI is just a laughable fantasy. Perhaps if Sam Altman hadn’t dropped out of a comp sci program, he might know this, but he’s from a rich family so he could always retreat back into money and vast carelessness. And then we get to the whole issue of data centers, their costs, the investment bubble, etc. Regarding the question about FOSS alternatives, and alternatives to the big data center apps… One of my colleagues has been experimenting with local LLMs. This colleague is a professional software engineer with decades of experience. Key findings about local LLMs: * Vision detection using an Intel Arc A770 (12GB of ram) works but gives many false positives. * Voice commands work only for the simplest commands. Anything beyond “turn on the kitchen light” fails to translate into expected actions. * Trying to write kubernetes YAML — the results are so terrible it’s just laughable. * Code generated in other languages “utter trash”. * Trying to resolve actual networking problems gives the same few suggestions, all of which were incorrect. * Trying to solve networking problems with cloud-based LLMs isn’t much better. * Using the app for an interactive diary, it got stuck in discussion loops after a few days. * Open source LLMs on Hugging Face are always well behind the commercial offerings from OpenAI et alia. Conclusion: currently-available local LLMs are simply not usable for many problems, or will cost too much to produce better results. From my vantage point, a lot of the hype around generative AI is being sustained by people who stumble through vibe coding a basic app and then say “wow, this is amazing — I wrote an app but I didn’t have to learn to code!” Basically, these are people looking for a free lunch. They want to be able to say “I wrote an app” but they don’t want to make the effort to learn a programming language. There are also those who say they want to learn, but in fact they are unwilling to just sit down and read a book. There are hundreds and hundreds of books about many different programming languages, expressly for this purpose. E.g., once upon a time, I read Kernighan and Ritchie’s The C Programming Language. It’s well-written and not very long. This is the tried and true way of doing it. But vibe coders don’t want to make such an effort. They want to “chat” with an AI to “learn” what they would get from simply reading a book. In other words, they want hold-holding and fawning attention from a sycophantic bot, all the way through. The unspoken premise here is that learning a programming language is some sort of insanely difficult task — but is it really? IMO, this leads us directly to a deeper issue, which is people who expect rewards — or actually feel entitled to those rewards — but don’t want to make any effort to get those rewards. What i found more damning is that while there are indeed applications for which de LLM models can be useful and help humans with some cumbersome tasks the big 7 keep focused on AGI. Interesting but boring business models bypassed in the search for some utopian or dystopian tech control of everything. The bubble is very, very high above us. And agreed: very good article. “…once upon a time, I read…” This is actually the key failing of AI. You read and comprehended something. LLM’s are given information to make statistically inferred outputs. They don’t read nor comprehend the information that was provided to them in training. I have some limited experience with local LLMs. It was like working with a 3 year old… but unlike a 3 year old, it never learned and kept making the same mistakes. Once in a while, I got better results without changing anything, and other times worse. Software engineer here. I can’t add much to this, unless the idea of AI code generation is to change my job from thinking about solutions to business concerns to thinking about editing the AI’s probabilistic solutions to business concerns, is the order of the day. Of course the there has been some big talk, but not many takers yet it seems. Amazon made hay over exactly this not long ago, as if the efficiency gains are something you can now take to the bank, and removed “tens of thousands” of workers from their rolls. But a few months later it turns out they just wanted to hire a bunch of H1b visa holders instead. Turns out AI ‘efficiency gains’ are simply wage cuts: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ “Those aren’t eatin’ sardines, their tradin’ sardines.” *they’re too early in the morning to try to be witty. sardine (n.) : “pilchard, type of small oily fish,” migratory and highly esteemed as a food, early 15c., from Latin sardina, sarda, from late Greek sardinē, sardinos, earlier sardē, which is often said to be from or related to Sardō “Sardinia” (see Sardinia), the Mediterranean island, near which the fish probably were caught and from which they were exported. which takes us back to the previous discussion of Sardonic Laughter. When i was in Cali i didn’t ask for pilchards but sardines and it was better understood by many sellers there. You know what happens with fish names: they are local and you have plenty of regional variations which apply to some similar fish species. If you enter “sardine” in fishbase you obtain 63 entries from many different regions representing more than two dozen species besides Sardina pilchardus. My wife has had a curious experience with AI-driven decisions taken in a Spanish bank. She was being charged some commissions on her account which according to bank rules were not applicable in this account. She went to a branch to get those removed and dis-charged. The person attending her agreed that she was right but when she tried, the AI algorithms didn’t allow to remove the commission because some obscure “original sin”, let’s call it this way, coming from the merger of the original bank where the account had been opened long ago. In the end this has been solved by a helping attendant who decided that the only way to do this was to deceive the algorithm with false data. You can imagine where is this all going when you have to resort to tricks. Sounds like a great way to have a crooked bank employee feed the AI algorithm some dodgy data so that bank funds are sent to an account that may not be “officially” listed. Would banks miss money going into a bank account that they cannot find listed in their files or even know about? That sounds a lot like the begging process that medical professionals face, with insurance company “care approval” protocols. There is no shortage of stories about doctors and patients trying to get timely care coverage. Insurers claim cost savings and better care, but charts suggest otherwise. There is a thingy about this on the Netflix show Barry and is in real life the Australian Robo Debt debacle – https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-04/robodebt-victims-get-compensation-from-class-action/105734030 I mean its not like there is some decades of these machinations in the “Market Place” and some are still confused … HR is old hat now lmmao … This is a tangent, but bear with me – it’s good and kinda relevant. The last link in the article is to a Science News Today article about building a “Dyson Sphere.” The article states: Dyson’s idea was born out of a need to conceptualize how an advanced civilization could continue to thrive as it consumed more and more energy. This is fake news (and a very common misconception). Freeman Dyson was making fun of the tortured logic used by SETI scientists to explain why they thought looking for particular radio waves would be a reasonable way to scan the stars for life. The article in which Dyson proposed the sphere was a one-page parody letter to an astro-physics journal. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t get dry humor (which is extremely obvious when you read the actual ‘paper’) and took him seriously. Dyson himself thought it was funny that he was best known for a joke he made instead of any of the actual physics he did. At any rate, the fact that a science news website is acting like Dyson Spheres make any sense at all (they don’t, and purposely so) is pretty indicative of where we’re at as a society…i.e. pretty far down the path to Idiocracy. So the guy bringing us GenAI talking about building Dyson Spheres is pretty on-brand. The best part of Altman’s quote got cut out in the article, however. Right after mentioning Dyson spheres, he says, “Like probably in the next 10 years or something.” roflmao. IBM TV ad on streaming: “Blue gonna help you transform your business with AI.” Reminds me of the TQM craze, everyone chased it no one read Deming! It’s doing wonders for their stock price, though. Victory! Why does this whole sorry episode remind me of the Biblical story of The Tower of Babel? It will all end in tears … As of last night, it finally dawned on me that I’ve been noticing what must be AI generated text in the description feeds to my Amazon Prime video account feeds. The first one I saw, but didn’t recognize it at the time as an AI hallucination, was a movie with the description that started something like, “Set in the 1920’s…”. However watching the trailer it was obvious the story was more modern, but the one item that probably threw me was there was one brief photo in the trailer that was older – maybe from the 1920’s. Anyhow I was confused enough by it that I just kept skipping it. Then last night I watch “The Healer”. It’s intro text started something like, “From the 17th century…” but again the trailer was all modern. I mentally just assumed the 17th century was a reference to a family history of healers which was part of the story line (that it was a family thing). However, after watching it there is NEVER any mention of anything from the 17th century. Then it dawned on me that it might be an AI hallucination. When I even went to the Amazon website the descriptive text there for “The Healer” never said anything about the 17th century, it was only in my Amazon Prime feed from the app on my Android TV. I am now certain my confusion over the “Set in the 1920’s” is also a hallucination. For all your readers who are interested in the history of AI’s coming into being in its current form Matteo Pasquinelli’s book, ‘The Eye of the Master: a social history of Artificial Intelligence’ is indepensable. It chartes the battles of the neuroscience sector, the interests of the US navy and Marxist analysis of labour power with formidable argument to demonstrate the deep flaws in AI’s claims to triumphant revolution. Well, with AI replacing labor, AI robotics replacing labor, AI replacing thinking … AI replacing….. with AI getting all the money to be productive while actual humans have income while that income is depleted more and more by out-go. You would think that fewer and fewer people will be able to afford the purchase or consumption of these magical AI fantasies. I guess if humans are to be digitized to the point of no choice, well then, AI will have all the biological imput devices for it’s consumption and outputs designed to maximize profits I am waiting for AI to come of age in law and take over for lawyers and judges. Between the constant stories of AI hallucinations re: legal case, and anecdotes about AIs learning to “cheat,” I can only imagine what sort of dystopic Wild West is coming for the court system… “The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use.” The disappointing performance of the COVID-19 vaccines raises doubts about Biomedicine’s ability to read and understand the scientific literature, which has demonstrated conclusively that durable immunity to coronaviruses is unattainable in vertebrates, either through previous infection or vaccination. Nevertheless, Operation Warp Speed was built on the premise that after everyone was vaccinated the pandemic would recede into nothingness. Cost was no object, and a few transnational Big Pharma corporations made tens of billions of dollars during 2021 and 2022, with the expectation of a continuing money stream after the initial surge in vaccinations. This approach was the only way forward and would lead to a revolution in rapid responses to future emerging infectious diseases using mRNA vaccines. And the scientists who figured out how to stabilize expression of exogenous mRNA in the target cells and tissues were awarded a Nobel Prize for their previously underappreciated research. Some calm reflection is in order. If all progress in AI development stopped cold today, it would take 20 years for its benefits to percolate through the world economy. Note that the productivity potential of networked computer technology and uniform electronic data standards available 20 years ago has still not been achieved, largely because of institutional behavioral inertia. The gating factor in the application of intelligence to the problems of man is not the pace of the synthesis of intelligence, it is the unwillingness of mankind to behave intelligently in accepting change. We know how to make universal medical charts and records. We know how to fully automate air traffic control. We know how to prevent train collisions. We know how to build trusted voting systems. But we are good at finding reasons for not doing the things we say we want to accomplish. Of course, when something becomes an “emergency,” suddenly the obvious is discovered. Welcome to the modern world: powered by emergencies, not emergent technologies. It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. — Niccolò Machiavelli This IS calm reflection, and not a moment too soon, in the face of too much cult-like marketing hype. Who is this “we” that will harness technology for the good of mankind? If recent history has shown us anything at all, it is that the application of new technologies—at least in the Western world—will be controlled by the most ruthlessly exploitive financial interests and used primarily if not exclusively to extract value from everyone else. This is the opposite of broadbased dissemination and learning that filters into quality improvements across sectors, raising living standards. My sister is a nurse. I’ve heard quite a bit about the rollout and aftermath of the EPIC medical management system. It is not designed to help medical providers or improve patient care. It’s about billing, full stop, and it’s hated by pretty much everyone she knows in her field. “We know how to make universal medical charts and records.” Yes, we do. And they have very little to do with improving healthcare and everything to do with billing and upcoding. No single $8-ibuprofen tablet shall remain unaccounted for! It is also true that AI transcribed charts are often replete with mistranslations and outright hallucinations. It is a sad fact that U.S. hospitals have effectively resisted the automation and interoperability of their systems for decades. Medical professionals have insisted on preserving institutional moats and drawbridges that render their computer systems highly incompatible, despite the obvious need to track the same patient information. There is no digital standard for the patient chart, the most basic medical record. Between 5 to 10 percent of patients are harmed by medical error. Surely uniform AI cross checks on diagnosis and treatment would reduce that. Put on top of this a health insurance structure that only M.C. Escher could depict, and you have an inefficient mess attributable not to evil computer geniuses, but to institutional turf wars, perverse incentives, and just plain cussedness. It’s not just medical institutions. Look at the power grid, the rail system, pipeline infrastructure, and air traffic control. Look at the inability to build housing, the plague of homeless mentally ill people, all in a nation that is among the richest in the world. Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem? Is misguided technology speculation [that will probably crash a debt-ridden economy] really a central problem? It sounds bad to me… Private Debt mate “Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem?” It’s certainly not the solution. Most of this is due to the category error that his health insurance. People insure their lives and property against events that are unlikely. Illness and accident are not in this category. No argument from me that if healthcare were the objective instead of private profit (even in “nonprofit” hospitals), interoperability and legitimate electronic health records could be useful and universal and improve healthcare all around. According to STAT yesterday, UpToDate is unveiling its AI version. UpToDate has become the near universal cheat sheet for clinicians. Still, from the article: That kind of explainability is critical as doctors choose when and how to let different AI tools help them, said Crowe. But healthcare AI experts emphasized that those advances have not eliminated the chance for error through hallucinations, omissions, or other more nuanced LLM mistakes. Stanford’s Chen cited an example in which a resident had treated a patient with severe alcohol withdrawal with phenobarbital, a powerful sedative and anticonvulsant, based on an LLM-based tool’s response. Chen asked the AI the same question, and got the response he expected: First line therapy was safer benzodiazepines, followed by phenobarbital. “AI will just make up some stuff — or even if it doesn’t make up stuff, it’s a little bit random,” he said. “This unpredictability is what allows it to be kind of creative and flexible. But do you want to be creative when you’re practicing medicine?” Some clinical generative AI tools may perform better than others — depending on their engineering, the data they’re trained on, or their underlying LLMs. There are tradeoffs involved in choosing any subset of medical material to train on. “You are potentially missing some important information if you’re not pulling from more up-to-date resources,” said physician Cornelius James, who researches AI and evidence-based medicine at the University of Michigan. “But you also avoid bias in that you’re not pulling from some of those more up-to-date resources.” But clinicians are missing the details needed to make informed choices between tools. “The general state of the evidence is terrible,” said neurosurgeon Eric Oermann, who directs the Health AI Research Lab at NYU Langone. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. Benchmarks are imperfect, said Oermann, but at least they allow for researchers to compare large language models from tech companies like Google and OpenAI on a level playing field by peppering their APIs with thousands of programmed questions. Anyway, I do not think it unreasonable to expect a resident physician to know that benzodiazepines are the preferred choice over phenobarbital for a patient suffering from alcohol withdrawal, which is not a particularly rare condition. It has been said millions times that “being educated means knowing where to look up something.” No, being educated means knowing what you know and what you don’t know. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. GingerBalls on the Twitter often points out that there’s an unintelligent solution to every intelligence test, so passing these licensing exams is meaningless. Participation in the technical aspects of this discussion, which I am reading with great interest, is above my pay grade, but an observation: the medical and pharmaceutical professions, at least in Canada, are currently the sole remaining market for fax machines. You clearly have not been paying attention to our decade+ posting, based on the work of medical professionals who happen to be experts in IT, as well as the experience of users, that electronic health records are an utter train wreck. And it has NADA to do with your bogus depiction. The process has been driven by billing and the desire to upcode. Not medical care. Not ever remotely your fabricated “medical professionals preserving institutional moats’. You need to stop Making Shit Up when you do not know what you are talking about. Agree with everything here except timing. Some economists tried to quantify the technology diffusion rate and found it’s closer to fifty years instead of twenty if you’re looking at full global adoption. Smartphones took over the world and changed our brains in less than ten years, on the other hand. But yes, there are still Homo sap tribes living in the Amazon who don’t know the world outside their forest and are living the way they lived in 20,000 years (though not in the Americas). Personally, I think it’ll be a sad day if and when they cease to be there — because the world is coming for them — though I wouldn’t wish to be one of them. “Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” … Perfect. Re: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last? By Servaas Storm Proper descriptive language is critical to the analysis and reworking of human systems. Therefore, being lulled into repeating truisms that are not true undermines the work being undertaken. In the article, Storm says, “The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels.” That phrase is not true. Eliminating “workers and” corrects the statement, ironically, by doing exactly what makes AI so attractive to “firms.” The idea that automation makes the residual workforce more productive has always been a lie, a lie that has been encouraged by ownership simply because it has some ability to make that residual workforce proud of the machines that make it “the most productive workforce in human history,” even as the latest machines pick off the remaining laborers, one by one. Dividing amount of production by number of laborers to get ever-rising labor productivity figures is a stupid accounting trick. Dividing production by labor equivalent units (LEU’s – and, yes, this is adapted from containerized shipping) gives away the game. By not defining or measuring LEU’s, it veils the possibility that productivity – given that energy and pollution would necessarily be figured into the cost of each LEU – would be revealed as having heretofore invisible periods of stagnation, even regression. More importantly, defining and measuring LEU’s would eliminate any last trace of simplistically attributing productivity to labor. By dividing measured production between labor and LEU’s, it would make stark the reality that ownership always trumps attribution. Attributed productivity has never given more than a tenuous claim to the profits of production. Labor has always known that. Labor has long been able to project the trend of increasing productivity and has long dreaded that projection: that eventually “labor” would be reduced to a janitor cleaning up after the machines, working for minimum wage, while being attributed trillions in productivity. Ownership matters. Once nourishment and a safe place to live is secured, ideas are the most valuable commodities, yet “intellectual property” is almost an oxymoron. Technique ends up embedded in tools. That is why, where the guilds were strong, possessing the tools of a craftsman, without being a member of the appropriate guild might actually be a crime. Similarly, the Luddites were not so much opposed to advances in technology as they were the embedding of their intellectual property into an array of machines. Truly, the machinists were the first computer programers, and they feasted on converting the deep skills of others into own-able hardware. Now, the programmers are coming for the artists, the scientists, even the C-suites, and the latest generation of programmers might be the last, as intellectual property devours its producers, and is left to eat its own tail. But the last programmer will be attributed a vast productivity. “Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” That’s some Chinese characteristics that I endorse. The USA business and financial sector is preoccupied with trying to insert rent-seeking middle-men between all the issues that could be addressed now – for and by people in the here and now. The people who have to be healthy, sane, and safe in order to have healthy, sane, and safe people in the future. It’s still just fucking software! What a con! If you are interested in a detailed outline of the progress of AI in the MIC, here is a great substack that explains what is going on in the field where military combat AI is being developed. It focuses on Arizona and New Mexico because the largest combat military training centers in the world are located there. I foresee a great future for AI as the military has unlimited financing for the large corporations dabbing in that field. https://sonoransown.substack.com/p/life-recast I guess this is the terminal phase of the AI bubble, the phase I remember from the dotcom one – if you mention the risks that were mounting by the hour people would yell at you because the objective was to get funding and walk away with all you could in the crash. And in five years somebody buys the infrastructure for pennies on the dollar and turns a profit on porn or whatever. Only a tiny example of odd experience: I was testing duck.ai as my system is too old to host the new programs. I wanted duck.ai to shorten a narrative text by 10, then 20, then 50%. For some internal error it cut it down by 90%, 80% and 50% respectively. This failure repeated. It never came up with versions which would be 10% shorter or 20% than what I had fed it with. Strange. Generally the results with narrative fiction are horrible. What the system is offering (they claim to treat the texts confidential) is either total nonsense or equipped with some sense but solely by coincidence. Containing meaning that has little to do with what I had originally written. This is especially true – and now any programmer should seriously lsiten up – humour or “poetical” formulations. Style in general is overwhelming it. Anything where “tonality” comes into play crashes it . As I said I can´t judge state of the art systems. But unless I tell any AI to reproduce something in the style of say TS Eliot, or Dickens or Austen, it doesn´t know wha to do. It is totally lost and will fail to develope inherent styles of its own. And produce gibberish. Which shouldn´t surprise. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers rebelled against the machines. They intuited that if they did not own the machines, the machines would own them. This is also the case with robotics in production, “Who owns the robots?” AI in my thinking is no more than a language and data collecting robot. So, “who owns AI?” We see that financialization and rent-seeking have turned AI research into a mess. By all accounts, researchers in China do not do the same. #DotComBoomBustMemories I had a video chat with one of my younger colleagues at work, and they asked me what similarities if any I see between the dot-com-boom, and this new AI-boom. At first, I thought that the dot-com-boom was really more intense flying-by-the-seat-of-ones-pants-into-the-unknown … but as we talked through it, I realized, that this is potentially far worse. The lemmings from lower Manhattan and the sycophants from the valley of silicon are getting the band back together! Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. Once again, the odious runaway sewage train (via YouTube) of unicorn valuations looks set to derail and spill sh** everywhere. When the colo-business (via dgtlinfra.com) collapsed after the dot-com-bust, a lot of data-center space in NY/NJ, for example, reverted to office space. The intervening years brought public-cloud to the fore, and now public cloud space is set to expand just like metro datacenter space expanded at the turn of the century. One can only imagine the impact of large AI-specific datacenters being built out in the boonies (where land/tax, water and power are cheaper, ostensibly) only to have them decommissioned and empty when the bust invariably comes. Empty strip mall desert redux, anyone? One of the reasons the tech-bros are focused on “surpassing human intelligence” is because they absolutely loathe labor. The finance bros may seem convinced about AI, but they’re not fully. They want two things: • Proof that AI can generate new revenue streams – this, they have gotten thus far. • Proof that AI can kill jobs – this, they haven’t got (to a satisfactory degree yet), and I think this is what they really, really want. The dumb asses don’t understand how an economy works at all, and are blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. So, yeah … bubble, bubble, toil and trouble! And if, by some chance, this edifice of irrational exuberance somehow manages to survive, just remember: AI is gonna replace everyone … except VC’s … #natch (via futurism.com). Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. > I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. Thanks much for the confirmation! I know these types, but don’t share environs often. Sadly, the article did NOT look at AI in China – but was navel-focused. China AI is primarily focused on the factory, where it actually provides quantifiable cost savings. The US AI has been focused on rendering a larger fraction of the population as inessential workers – to use the language of Bender in Futurama – meatbags – consistent with the disdain the oligarchs have for the lumpen population. Karma when the bubble bursts? Computers are supposed to compute. That is their utility 2+2=4,every time maybe boring, but that is all there is. Your email address will not be published.

Although layoffs have been slowing, it's been an especially tough year for government workers and for staff at nonprofits that rely on federal funds. Kai checks on a couple of recession indicators. As spending on AI data centers booms, so does spending for industrial outdoor storage, where companies store tools, trailers, and other equipment. The Department of Energy said the U.S. is taking a 5% equity ownership in Lithium Americas, a company that’s working to open up one of the world’s largest lithium mines at Thacker Pass in Nevada.

According to a Bloomberg report, the secondary sale lets current and former staff who had held shares for at least two years sell stock to a handful of companies, including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price. The deal marks OpenAI’s second major tender offer in under a year, following a $1.5 billion SoftBank transaction last November. In January, the Japanese conglomerate was reportedly in talks to earmark up to $25 billion for OpenAI. SoftBank’s U.S.-traded shares (SFTBY) rose 1.7% to $66.04 on Thursday after news of the OpenAI share sale, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its AI-linked deals. The $500 billion figure reflects a steep rise for OpenAI from earlier in the year, when the ChatGPT developer was valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round led by Softbank in March. With this latest move, the company now sits ahead of SpaceX—whose own valuation is estimated near $400 billion—putting OpenAI at the top of the private company universe. Despite scrutiny around the rollout of GPT-5, investor confidence remains undimmed. In September, OpenAI and Nvidia unveiled a strategic infrastructure partnership: OpenAI plans to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion progressively as each gigawatt is deployed. Jensen Huang described it as part of “bringing AI infrastructure from the labs into the world.” It also coincides with the ongoing Stargate partnership between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle to build out America’s AI infrastructure backed by the Trump Administration. The sale also gives employees liquidity that could help the company fend off nine-figure pay packages from rivals such as Meta, which is aggressively hiring for its new Superintelligence Labs. The timing also coincides with structural moves at OpenAI. The company lifted its capped-profit limit in May, all the while facing continued legal pressure from Elon Musk. An OpenAI co-founder, Musk has sued the company on multiple occasions. Musk has accused OpenAI of abandoning its original nonprofit mission and allegedly attempting to steal xAI data and trade secrets.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Buffett's Berkshire Buys; Fair Isaac Soars, Equifax Falls

Shares of a data analytics firm took off after the company said it would provide its consumer credit scores directly to firms that give credit reports to mortgage lenders. The move pressured the credit bureaus that also evaluate potential borrowers. Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher Thursday. Outperformance from materials and technology stocks offset declines in most sectors as investors continued to weigh the implications of a government shutdown. The S&P 500 added less than 0.1%, while the Dow and the Nasdaq were up 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. See here to read Investopedia's full coverage of the day's trading. Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) confirmed a nearly $10 billion deal to acquire the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum (OXY). The transaction marks Berkshire's largest deal since 2022. Shares of Occidental Petroleum fell 7.3%, while Berkshire Hathaway shares posted fractional losses. Fair Isaac (FICO) shares surged 18%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500, after the data analytics company said it would offer its FICO consumer credit scores directly to firms that sell consolidated credit reports to mortgage providers. The data provider said the move would reduce the reliance on the three nationwide credit bureaus, and shares of the credit bureaus moved lower. Equifax (EFX) shares were down 8.5%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock, while TransUnion (TRU) shares dropped nearly 11%. The prices of bitcoin (BTCUSD) and other major cryptocurrencies extended their recent revival. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, jumped 7.5%, while of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which also offers crypto trading, added 4.1%. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev at a conference predicted that the "tokenization" of real-world assets, including stocks, would have a major impact on global financial markets. Intel (INTC) shares gained 3.8% in the wake of recent reports that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in early talks to become a customer of Intel's foundry business. Intel stock has doubled in value since reaching its year-to-date low in April, boosted by a series of high-profile investments from Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank (SFTBY), and the U.S. government. Shares of the renewable energy provider AES Corp. (AES) sank 7%. The downturn reversed some of the gains posted in the previous session amid reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by BlackRock (BLK), was in advanced negotiations about a potential acquisition of AES, which has signed deals with several tech firms to power artificial intelligence data centers.

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) capitalized on Wall Street’s artificial intelligence boom Thursday, fueled by billions in chip investments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and other technology giants. Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market. While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers.

Title: Meta gives advertisers new AI personalization tools - while using your chats to target content
URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-gives-advertisers-new-ai-personalization-tools-while-using-your-chats-to-target-content/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T19:20:55Z

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Meta is continuing to build AI for advertisers. Its latest AI agent and several new tools are designed to serve as an automated online sales assistant and personalization feature for small- to medium-sized businesses, even outside of Facebook and other Meta platforms. Also: 5 reasons I use local AI on my desktop - instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude At the same time, the company will start using your chats with Meta AI to personalize the ads you see on Meta platforms. The company's new Business AI agent can provide online shoppers with basic customer support and product recommendations on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. The goal is to quicken the process between customers discovering a new product and completing a purchase, while simultaneously freeing businesses up to focus their attention on more pressing tasks. Leading tech companies have been investing heavily in business-facing AI agents, promoting them as a simple and effective way to automate busywork. Like many other agents, Business AI specializes in analyzing and integrating with the context of the business deploying it; the system automatically assesses a brand's preexisting online presence to modify its outputs. Also: How autonomous businesses succeed by engaging with the world Eligible businesses can now access Meta's new agent for free via Meta Ads. It's also available "at a fraction of the cost of other solutions," Meta wrote in a company blog post, for businesses based in the US that want to add it to their website, or to their WhatsApp and Messenger accounts, with availability in more countries expected soon. (A company spokesperson declined to provide additional details around the agent's pricing structure.) Alongside this product release, Meta had some news about its user experience and personalization policy. Starting Dec. 16, the company will begin using individual users' interactions with its Meta AI chatbot to customize the ads and content recommendations they see on Facebook and Instagram, the company announced Wednesday. Someone asking one of Meta's chatbots about local dining options, for example, might start seeing ads for nearby restaurants on Meta platforms. There's no opt-out option for the new personalization changes, Meta said in its announcement. You always have the option of not interacting with the company's chatbots while using its apps, of course, but the company is also reportedly working on chatbots that proactively strike up a conversation with users. Also: My new favorite Photoshop AI tool lets me combine images in one click - and I can't stop Some conversation topics won't be included as training data, including anything that covers sexual orientation, health, race, religion, or political views. Chats that take place before Dec. 16 also won't be used, and the personalization changes will not initially apply to users in the UK, South Korea, or the European Union, a Meta spokesperson confirmed to ZDNET. While Meta said it won't start using chat data for targeting ads until Dec. 16, it's hard not to see a relationship between the company's increased in-house personalization via AI and the launch of external AI personalization tools for businesses. It's unclear what the relationship will be between user chat data and the models powering external tools for advertisers. Meta also announced Thursday that it was launching more AI tools to help businesses create ads on Advantage+, its AI-powered social media ad campaign management platform. There's a new AI-generated music feature, for example, which, according to Meta, "understands the content of an ad and produces unique, custom music that reflects the product, style, and sentiment -- helping brands better engage their audiences and connect in new ways." Also: Meta wants AI to automate every step of the ad production process - report The company also introduced AI dubbing for quick translation to reach international audiences, a tool for generating higher-quality AI-generated videos in ads, and another that generates a set of images curated to different audience demographics. The new features build on a broader offering of generative AI tools for advertisers, which Meta first began rolling out in October 2023, during the company's so-called "Year of Efficiency," which centered on -- among other initiatives -- internal layoffs and a shift in focus toward AI. While Meta pushes new AI tools to businesses to help them sell products, the company is also working towards automating the entirety of the advertising production process, from ideation to campaign launch -- although it isn't totally clear at this point what such comprehensive automation might look like in practice. Also: The work AI should really be doing, according to these pros Similarly, Amazon unveiled an agent last month that can assist with every step of creating a short video ad, including the generation of custom voiceovers.

Title: OpenAI valuation reaches $500 billion, topping Musk’s SpaceX
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/02/openai-valuation-reaches-500-billion-topping-musks-spacex/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T18:37:55Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has completed a deal to help employees sell shares in the company at a $500 billion valuation, propelling the ChatGPT owner past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, a person familiar with the transaction said. That boosted the US company’s price tag well past its previous $300 billion level during a SoftBank-led financing round earlier this year. That rapid rise underscores the investment frenzy surrounding the leaders of a technology with the potential to transform industries and economies. Sam Altman’s OpenAI is one of several companies including Nvidia Corp. now leading a global push to build data centers and develop artificial intelligence services, an undertaking that’s expected to cost trillions of dollars. Though it has yet to turn a profit, the US startup is helping fuel that infrastructure boom by inking mega-sized deals with the likes of Oracle Corp. and SK Hynix Inc. Representatives for Thrive Capital and Dragoneer didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, SoftBank and T. Rowe Price spokespeople declined to comment. A spokesperson for MGX said the firm is “pleased to be a core partner to OpenAI and to continue building on our strong relationship as a significant investor across multiple funding rounds.” The deal vaults OpenAI past SpaceX’s $400 billion valuation. That milestone coincides with a pivotal time for Altman’s company, which is in negotiations with Microsoft Corp. to convert into a more traditional for-profit company. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit dedicated to advancing digital intelligence “in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” Planned changes will give the existing OpenAI nonprofit entity control over a new public benefit corporation. Both Altman and Musk, who were OpenAI co-founders, have spoken about the potential existential risk to humans posed by AI. Yet they’ve since fallen out: Musk has sued to try and stop the overhaul, accusing OpenAI of forsaking promises to him when he helped to create the nonprofit. He claims it abandoned its founding purpose when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI’s board. When it comes to the business itself, OpenAI faces an increasingly competitive market for AI talent as big tech firms jockey for the resources they need. Meta Platforms Inc., for one, has recruited researchers aggressively from OpenAI and other top labs for its new “superintelligence” team, offering pay packages in the nine-figure range. A secondary sale could help OpenAI incentivize staff to stay at the company and turn down those lavish compensation offers. Major US startups often negotiate share sales for their employees as a way to reward and retain staff, and also attract external investors. OpenAI is looking to leverage investor demand to provide employees with liquidity that reflects the company’s growth. The value of a company tied to a secondary share sale is separate from the traditional private market valuation set when a startup completes a new round of funding. The total amount of eligible units sold in the secondary fell short of the $10 billion-plus worth of stock that the company allowed for sale, the person familiar said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is private. That could mean current and former employees are demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability of the business, the person added. In the long run, OpenAI faces mounting competitive pressure from rivals such as Google and Anthropic, which is also raising capital at a rapid clip. In response, OpenAI has embarked on a spate of recent technology product launches. Those include a pair of open and freely available artificial intelligence models that can mimic the human process of reasoning, months after China’s DeepSeek gained global attention with its own open software. OpenAI released its most powerful GPT-5 model in August, aimed at shoring up its lead in an increasingly crowded sphere. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Could AMD Make Intel's Business as Hot as Its Stock?

Intel (INTC) was down and out, and then the White House flipped a switch and made it one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Semafor yesterday reported chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was in early talks to become an Intel Foundry customer. The report noted it was unclear how much of AMD’s business would go to Intel instead of its primary manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), or if the deal would include a direct investment. The White House is pushing hard to prop up Intel, which has spurred an outpouring of support for the embattled chipmaker from major tech companies. But none of the deals announced so far have come with commitments to use Intel's foundry. A manufacturing deal would signal more concrete support for Intel, giving investors more faith in the sustainability of its turnaround. The agreement would make AMD the latest in a string of entities partnering with or investing in Intel to extend a lifeline to one of the only U.S. companies capable of manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Japanese tech investor SoftBank in August invested $2 billion shortly before the White House converted Intel’s CHIPS Act grants into an approximately 10% equity stake. Nvidia (NVDA) followed suit in September when it said it would invest $5 billion and partner with Intel on new products. Intel has also reportedly discussed a tie-up with Apple (AAPL). Intel’s stock has soared amid the shows of support. Shares have doubled in value since hitting a year-to-date low in early April, and are up about 80% since CEO Lip-Bu Tan sat down with President Donald Trump in early August. It was shortly after that meeting that talk of the government taking a stake in Intel seemed to turn the tide in its favor. President Trump has made reviving American manufacturing a cornerstone of his second term, and semiconductors have taken on extra importance in the context of the U.S/China AI arms race and geopolitical tensions centered on Taiwan, where the majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors are made. The White House appears to think Intel is America’s best hope for making the kinds of chips deemed essential to securing technological and military superiority. Securing AMD as a foundry customer would be a major win for Intel, which has struggled for years to compete with TSMC, the world’s largest and most advanced contract chip maker. However, some analysts are skeptical that a foundry deal will materialize. “We could easily believe stories of companies (AMD or otherwise) seeking equity stakes, possibly at the encouragement of the administration,” wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a note on Thursday. “Hopes for a foundry deal (from anyone) seem very premature to us though, and not just because Intel and AMD remain locked in a competitive product battle that the latter is clearly winning at the moment.” The biggest challenge facing Intel in its efforts to strengthen its foundry business is capability, according to Bernstein. Intel’s new 18A manufacturing process, which is supposed to make chips faster and more energy efficient, “has suffered from delays and a general lack of foundry interest,” wrote Rasgon in August. And its next-gen 14A process, he says, is still years off. Investments from the government and tech partners may give Intel the capital it needs to improve its processes, but that will take time and Rasgon “suspect[s] concrete foundry announcements will have to wait until Intel can definitively demonstrate capability.” In the meantime, Rasgon expects to see more rumors of foundry deals bubble up as the White House carries on with its campaign to reinvigorate America’s industrial base.

Title: Elon Musk's Net Worth Just Hit A New Record—Here's How He Made $500 Billion

The world's richest man just got richer. Elon Musk became the first person with a net worth of $500 billion in October 2025, according to Forbes. Rising Tesla shares fueled this jump in Musk's fortune. The company's stock was up nearly 17% year-to-date as of Oct. 2, 2025. Musk's wealth has been in the news for a proposed new pay package that could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Shareholders are set to vote on this pay package in November. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. esla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

BySteve Denning, Senior Contributor. In my last article, How To Picture—And Understand—The Dow For The First Time, I showed how understanding the American stock market involves mastering the relationship between the long-term total return of leading firms and their performance on three key value-creating principles: Understanding how leading European stocks perform on the same measures in in Figure 1 provides further illumination. with some differences. Some of the American firms in the Dow win big in tech (The Mag 7 firms) but Europe dominates fashion (Hermès, LVMH) and has winners in tech (ASML) and defense.(RNMBF). Overall, European stocks have fewer big winners but also fewer bad losers. Value creation is key to long term performance in both, Firms doing consistently well on all three value-creation principles create more long term value than firms that don’t. 1.

Title: ChatGPT owner OpenAI hits $500B valuation after massive sale of shares

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI’s rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company had authorized sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T. Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank’s earlier investment in OpenAI’s $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit.

OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

FuncomGame PassGameStopMorning CheckpointROG Xbox Ally XStarbreeze Why is GameStop torching its business partner on social media? Can unionization help the studio behind Disco ElysiumÂ pull out of a rough couple of years? And what is one of the first people to get their Xbox Ally Rog handheld in the mail saying about it? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, Kotaku‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take a stroll down memory lane with this excerpt from then-chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shawn Layden’s speech at E3 2014. “It really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing,” Souls archeologist Lance McDonald wrote in a thread that’s been circulating again recently. 6 years ago @ShawnLayden delivered this mostly forgotten speech for PlayStation at E3, which for some reason it really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing. The CEO saying "It wasn't a multi-million seller, but that wasn't the point" at the time was nice pic.twitter.com/iK6KdnXm4w — Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) November 30, 2020 Project Baxter was a “co-op urban crawl through a reactive Dungeons & Dragons world, utilizing procedural tools to enhance emergent gameplay in an endlessly replayable setting.” It is no more. Starbreeze announced the project has been canceledÂ as it pivots to focusing exclusively on its multiplayer heist franchise. âThis was a difficult but necessary decision,âÂ CEO Adolf Kristjansson said in a statement. âOur strategy is clear: PAYDAY is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreezeâs position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.â The group will be represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and meet regularly with studio management to discuss workplace issues, GamesIndustry.bizÂ reports. The change comes after the cancellation of a Disco Elysium sequel, multiple rounds of layoffs, and an acrimonious split with the original game’s leads. “It’s been a super turbulent couple of years,” Poppy Ingham told GamesIndustry.biz. “Oh God, you’d open Slack and you wouldn’t know if you were expecting to see another podcast about the studio. You had no idea what was going to happen.” ZA/UM revealed a trailer for its next RPG, Zero Parades for Spies, at Sony’s most recent State of Play. We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online. pic.twitter.com/EAPGaud7cY — GameStop (@gamestop) October 1, 2025 The PokÃ©mon-card-trading house masquerading as a video game retailer used Microsoft’s Game Pass price hike announcement to chase clout and win back disaffected gamers who forget how much they once hated trading in games they paid full price for in exchange for pennies on the dollar. “We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online,” it posted on X. That was after several viral posts dunking on the latest Xbox move. Kotaku reached out to GameStop for clarification on how long this offer will last. Funcom called the desert survival crafting MMO “the biggest release weâve had in our 32-year-long history of making great games,” but added that it now has begin the “difficult process” of laying some people off as it pivots toward a console launch next year. Dune: Awakening debuted at over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam back in July and has been releasing steady updates for Early Access ever since. “The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues,” the studio told GamesIndustry.biz in a statement.

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said. The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses. OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership. The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned. OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.

Title: Job losses might be likely due to AI but Nvidia's CEO says the booming billion-dollar industry will always need more plumbers and electricians

It seems like it's AI or nothing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The explosion of generative AI over the last few years signals a change in the job market alongside it, and this brings with it worries of job instability and losses. With big players like Nvidia, Meta, X, and the governments worldwide further committing to AI, questions are posed to those at the very top. In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4, Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, "If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories." Huang argues, "The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom". "You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year." Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI. This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming. Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, tells Channel 4 News, that ‘electricians and plumbers’ will be the big winners in the AI race as the skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a 'boom'. #Tech #AI #Nvidia #Economy #C4News OpenAI's spending has also skyrocketed, alongside ChatGPT's popularity, and the US government is firmly behind cementing "US dominance in artificial intelligence". From a PC gaming perspective, we've even seen brands like Razer jump on the AI bandwagon. This is all to say AI doesn't appear to be going away, and it has backing in the hundreds of billions. When asked what could happen if the UK doesn't 'grasp this opportunity', Huang says, "just as the last industrial revolution, the reason why it came about was because you needed it. And so the industrial revolution that started here in the UK came out of need. You need it now, too." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Earlier this year, the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology signed an agreement with OpenAI to push the chatbot into the public sector in a further bid to make the UK an AI powerhouse. Though highlighting future employment seems relevant to current fears around the job market, this doesn't address those who have degrees and experience in fields being replaced. Senator Bernie Sanders argued in June that "Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers". A month after this, OpenAI's Sam Altman shared that he thinks some jobs will be "totally, totally gone" due to AI. A former Google executive in August argued AI will lead to a "short-term dystopia" because it will struggle to create new jobs for those it is replacing. Huang tells reporters, "You're going to be building out AI infrastructure here in the UK for a decade," but it's not clear what the plan is for workers after that. 1.

Title: Why Adobe Stock Is A Cash Engine?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/02/why-adobe-stock-is-a-cash-engine/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:13:58Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) is down 22% this year, primarily due to rising concerns centered on rising competition from both lower-cost creative software alternatives and new AI-powered tools, combined with signs of slowing growth in the company’s subscription business. Despite these headwinds, we believe the stock warrants a close look. Here is why we believe Adobe deserves your attention. Free Cash Flow Yield is calculated as free cash flow per share divided by the stock price. Why does this matter? High cash generation per share allows a company to invest in further revenue growth or distribute dividends, or buybacks to shareholders. For context, Adobe offers a wide array of software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, catering to enterprise clients in the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. But do these figures convey the whole picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine if Adobe still possesses an advantage that withstands scrutiny. This is just one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio takes a broader approach, aimed at mitigating stock-specific risks while providing exposure to potential upside. In fact, it has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The following statistics stem from a high FCF yield selection strategy between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025. These statistics are calculated based on monthly selections and assume that once a stock is chosen, it cannot be re-selected for the next 180 days. That being said, Adobe has faced considerable declines during difficult periods. It dropped roughly 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decrease was around 60%. Even less severe declines, such as in 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic, erased approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite its numerous advantages, Adobe is not immune to adverse market conditions. However, the risk extends beyond major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market environments—consider events such as earnings releases, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor—especially given the fluctuations associated with individual stocks. Instead, look at the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ChatGPT Shopping: How to Get AI to Recommend Your Products

Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:05:17Z
Full Content:
A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers getaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Written by Yongi Barnard ChatGPT recommends products — complete with photos, pricing, and purchase links — to its 700 million weekly users. And now customers can complete purchases without leaving the chat. BIG deal. But will ChatGPT recommend your products? That’s not automatic. And you can’t pay for placement. What you can do is optimize your site so ChatGPT understands what you sell, trusts your brand, and surfaces your products when buyers search. This guide shows you how. You’ll learn the eight-step framework for getting featured in ChatGPT Shopping. I also spoke with Leigh McKenzie, Backlinko’s Head of Growth and founder of the ecommerce brand UnderFit, to get his insights on what’s actually working. First, let’s look at how ChatGPT decides which products make the cut. ChatGPT Shopping kicks in automatically for some shopping intent prompts. While it doesn’t fire every time, I found it appears more often than not after testing 100+ prompts. The key? Typing a prompt with clear buying intent. Like “e-bikes that can handle potholes.” Instead of just explaining things or offering advice, ChatGPT Shopping recommends specific products. This includes product images, pricing, and links to online stores and websites where users can make a purchase. Side note: The ChatGPT Shopping experience isn’t consistent. Even with the same prompt, the carousel may (or may not) show. It can also appear at the top, middle, or bottom of the chat. This variability suggests the feature is still evolving. If your store gets recommended, countless high-intent shoppers will see your products. For example, when I tested the e-bike query, ChatGPT gave me a brief explanation of what features to prioritize. But it also provided a visual product carousel with eight products, each in its own card with key details. (It looks similar to Google Shopping ads, except you don’t have to pay for them.) Clicking on any card opens a side panel with: From there, users simply click “Visit” to reach the merchant’s product page. But this experience is changing. As of September 2025, OpenAI is rolling out Instant Checkout — a feature that lets shoppers buy directly inside ChatGPT. This is a huge shift. ChatGPT is no longer just a product discovery tool. It’s a full shopping destination. Right now, Instant Checkout is only available to Etsy sellers in the United States. But OpenAI plans to expand this feature to Shopify merchants and other countries soon. Not on either platform? They’re also accepting applications for merchants to build their own integrations. (More on this in Step #7.) A shopper describes what they’re looking for (“running shoes with arch support under $150”), and ChatGPT’s AI goes to work. It scans the web for the most relevant products based on that request. And weighs details like product names, descriptions, features, reviews, brand authority, and other signals to find the best matches. If your product checks the right boxes — and the information on your site is clear and crawlable — it has a chance to be recommended. ChatGPT may also consider the user’s location and preferences when making recommendations. Ultimately, all product recommendations must also pass through OpenAI’s safety systems. This filters out low-quality, misleading, or unsafe products. So, what does all of this mean for you? ChatGPT Shopping is evolving fast — and the brands that keep up will win the most visibility. Here’s how to ensure ChatGPT can understand, trust, and recommend your products. ChatGPT needs structured data to understand what you sell. Schema markup is code that labels key details on your product pages (and website as a whole): name, price, description, availability, reviews, and more. It turns raw HTML into data AI tools can parse instantly. Without it, ChatGPT (and other AI systems) have to guess what’s on your page. With it, they see clean, structured information they can confidently include in product recommendations. At a minimum, your product schema should include: It may look intimidating, but many content management systems — like WordPress, Shopify, and Wix — offer plugins or built-in tools that generate the markup for you automatically. Once your markup is in place, test that it’s working correctly using Google’s Rich Results Test or Schema.org’s validator. These tools make it easy to check that your structured data is valid, visible, and error-free. Pro tip: Go beyond the schema basics. Add AggregateRating for average review scores or FAQPage markup to answer common buyer questions. The more context you provide, the easier it is for AI to surface your product in response to specific prompts. A product feed is a structured file that packages up your product details and sends them to platforms like Google Merchant Center, Shopify, and Etsy. It includes details like titles, prices, availability, images, links, and more. ChatGPT may use data from major platforms like Google to decide which products to recommend. Pro tip: Want to add your product feed directly to ChatGPT? OpenAI will notify interested merchants when this feature is available. Fill out the Merchant Application form for consideration. For example, if your Google Shopping feed is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, ChatGPT may return bad information about your products. Or skip recommending them entirely. That’s why a high-quality, up-to-date product feed is critical. Side note: If you’re on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce or Shopify, feeds are usually created automatically. But keeping feeds accurate is easier said than done. There are a lot of moving parts, like site updates, refresh schedules, and third-party tools. And it only takes one slip for mismatches to creep in. Here are a few common product feed issues — and how to fix them: Automation keeps most updates in sync. And manual checks before major launches or sales help catch anything that may slip through. Here’s how Leigh maintains a balance of the two for his ecommerce store: “I keep all my product data in a spreadsheet. Whenever I change a product detail, I update it there first. WooCommerce uses that data to update my site’s pages and schema automatically. Then, Channable takes the same spreadsheet and syncs those updates into my product feeds. That way, my site and my feeds are always pulling from the same source, so everything stays consistent.” If ChatGPT can’t read your site, it can’t recommend your products. Two simple technical issues block many ecommerce sites from showing up: hidden content and restricted crawlers. Many AI bots — including ChatGPT — still struggle with content that only loads via JavaScript. If key details aren’t in the page’s raw HTML, the bot might never see them. This includes your product descriptions, prices, and images. Eek. Here’s how to check if that’s happening: If your product details disappear, it means they’re only loading through JavaScript. To fix this, work with a developer to ensure all essential information is in your site’s raw HTML. Your robots.txt file can also block AI crawlers. This small file tells bots which parts of your site they can (and can’t) crawl. By default, most sites already allow all bots, including ChatGPT’s crawler, OAI-SearchBot. But it’s still worth double-checking. Here’s how: First, go to yourdomain.com/robots.txt. Then, look for a rule like this: And this: If it says “Disallow,” then ChatGPT is unable to crawl your site. You (or your dev team) can fix this issue by changing it to “allow.” Further reading: 23 Best Large Language Models ChatGPT matches products to prompts by language, not keywords. So, if your product copy doesn’t sound like the way people talk, it may not surface in shopping results. The goal: write the way buyers phrase their prompts. You don’t have to guess how your customers talk. Use research tools like: Look for modifiers that mimic real queries — terms like “best,” “for beginners,” “eco-friendly,” or “kid-friendly.” Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit show you the actual prompts people type into AI engines. So, instead of manually guessing or testing one by one, you get a ready-made list of conversational queries buyers already use. Once you understand how your audience speaks, weave the terms naturally into your product titles and descriptions. This will increase the odds of your products showing up in ChatGPT when shoppers search. Further reading: 11 Awesome ChatGPT Alternatives to Try When you’re writing copy, pay special attention to your product titles. They often feed directly into the shopping carousel. And they’re the first thing shoppers see before deciding to click. The golden rule: Lead with what matters most to your audience. If trust drives decisions — like in categories such as laptops or smartphones — put your brand front and center. If features, benefits, or use cases are more important, focus on those instead. Use this simple formula: [Main Benefit or Feature] + [Product Type] (+ [Brand] if it builds trust) On Leigh’s site, for example, his titles highlight what buyers care about most: product benefits. That’s why they’re structured as Benefit (Invisible) + Product Type (Undershirt). But when brand recognition is vital to trust, it makes sense to include the brand name. Like this product title for a Sony home theater: Don’t worry about cramming every detail into the title. Most ecommerce platforms give you multiple fields for product info. Use those strategically to sprinkle in conversational keywords. Titles get people to click. Descriptions get them to buy. This is where you expand on features, benefits, and use cases — all in plain, natural language. For example, UnderFit’s product copy mirrors the words buyers use when searching for an undershirt. These words aren’t filler — they’re search terms. Which means they’re likely the same language people use when prompting ChatGPT. Your product’s value proposition needs to be clear and visible at the top of your product page. This ensures ChatGPT immediately understands: But that’s not enough. The rest of your page should support and reinforce that promise. This gives ChatGPT a complete picture of your product. And helps it see your product as the best fit for the query. This means every section — features, benefits, reviews, specs — should back up your value proposition with proof and detail. Huel’s Black Edition product page is a great example of this in action. The value proposition is right under the product title: “High Protein Complete Meal.” This instantly explains: The image reinforces this by highlighting complementary copy: “This is a meal. Not a protein shake” and “40g protein per meal.” The product description repeats the promise yet again: “40 grams of protein.” But it also adds details like “27 essential vitamins and minerals.” This repetition is exactly what you want. While you can (and should) use word variety, your page should tell one clear story from top to bottom. Explain what the product is, why it’s valuable, and how it delivers on that promise. So, audit your site. If copy and images don’t reinforce your core message, rework them until it does. The more consistent and focused your messaging is, the easier it is for ChatGPT to understand (and recommend) your products. Further reading: How to Use AI for Writing Exceptional Content (7 Best Practices) ChatGPT doesn’t just look at your product page when deciding what to recommend. It cross-checks authority signals from across the web to figure out whether your brand (and your product) are trustworthy enough to recommend. These signals include: One way to see which sources matter most for your brand is to run a manual check in ChatGPT. Type a shopping prompt into the tool, scroll to the answer, and click “Sources.” The links you see there are the sites that ChatGPT used to pull its recommendations. (And, by extension, the sites it trusts.) For example, when I asked for a “yoga mat with serious grip for hot yoga,” ChatGPT cited: Use the sources as your roadmap. Target them with outreach strategies like expert quotes, partnerships, and co-branded content. Can’t land mentions on the exact sites ChatGPT cited? Go after similar ones with comparable authority. And build your presence on community platforms, too. A strong showing on Reddit, Quora, and niche Facebook groups can boost your brand’s credibility. Instant Checkout lets shoppers go from product recommendation to purchase without ever leaving ChatGPT. Once they find something they like, they can confirm details, pay, and place an order — all within the same chat window. (Hashtag mind blown) Instant Checkout currently supports single-item purchases in the U.S. on Etsy. (But Shopify integration is coming soon.) If you’re on either platform, you’re in luck. Eligibility is automatic. For everyone else? You’ll need to apply and integrate with OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). Translation: Roll up your sleeves. There’s work to do. Here’s what you can do now. Start by filling out OpenAI’s merchant application form. This lets OpenAI know you want in. They’re onboarding merchants on a rolling basis and will reach out when you’re accepted. Once you’re in the pipeline, you’ll need to: Pro tip: Even if ChatGPT Instant Checkout isn’t available for your store yet, preparing your product data, feeds, and backend now will help you move faster when it is. This should give you a head start as this feature gains popularity. It’s not enough to show up in ChatGPT Shopping. You also need to measure how well you’re performing. Start with tracking traffic. The easiest way is through OpenAI’s built-in UTM tag. This is code that OpenAI automatically adds to all outbound links. And looks like this: Set up a custom segment in Google Analytics to track and analyze ChatGPT traffic to your site. Once that’s done, look for patterns: Side note: Not every ChatGPT mention will be traceable. Some users see your product in a chat and search your brand directly on Google instead of clicking. Look for spikes in branded search traffic or direct visits to gauge the broader impact of LLMs. But traffic only tells you what happens after people click. You also need to measure what happens before — specifically, which prompts surface your products. To do this, it helps to understand the kinds of prompts shoppers type. Most fall into four buckets. Think of these buckets as templates. Test prompts in each category and ask yourself: Repeatedly run these checks to gather more data. You’ll learn which prompts lead to product mentions, how your LLM visibility changes, and how buyers talk about your brand. Rather automate this process?

Title: OpenAI hits $500 billion valuation after share sale

Time Published: 2025-10-02T06:35:40Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters today. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. The company had authorised sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank's earlier investment in OpenAI's $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16 per cent more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages.

Title: Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios announces Liverpool shutdown and workforce cuts in Sweden

Full Content:
The Swedish developer behind the Just Cause and Mad Max series, Avalanche Studios, has announced the shutdown of its Liverpool studio, alongside a reduction of workforce at its core Malmo and Stockholm locations. The studio broke the news in a statement published on the company’s website on September 30, 2025, amid ongoing hurdles in the gaming industry. The Liverpool studio, established in 2020 as part of its global expansion, has now ceased operation entirely. Previously, the Liverpool location focused on support roles and had not released any standalone titles. Avalanche stated: In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success best. This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio and to initiate a collective consultation process as required by UK law. This will impact all “Avalanchers” in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmo and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs. The company also mentioned that it is focusing on offering full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time and that, despite the structural changes, the studio will remain fully committed to delivering amazing games to its passionate players. Currently, the number of affected employees remains under wraps. Avalanche Studios Group employs more than 600 people worldwide. This move marks the third such action by the company in just over a year, following the shutdown of its New York and Montreal offices in June 2024, which resulted in 50 layoffs. This announcement comes just one month after Microsoft canceled the co-op heist game, Contraband, which was being developed by Avalanche’s Liverpool team, which was first revealed four years ago in 2021. In August 2025, Microsoft paused development on the title amid its sweeping layoffs, and Avalanche announced that “active development has now stopped.” Considering the given circumstances, it seems unlikely that Contraband will be released anytime soon.

The skin care brand is unable to accept new orders on its website, with customers being redirected to Amazon. Senior Editor, Beauty What’s going on with Glamglow? The Estée Lauder Cos.-owned brand has removed e-commerce capabilities and content from its website. Instead, a text-based page now informs shoppers that while it’s unable to accept new orders, it’s still here “to help with any existing orders or refunds.” Shoppers are advised that they can still buy Glamglow products on Amazon. Lauder declined to comment when asked if the brand was shuttering or now only selling on Amazon. Related Articles Skin Care Nordic Impact: Oslo Skin Lab Lands in Milan Fashion Scoops Lucy Bridge Is Tom Ford's First Global Makeup Artist Glamglow, which Lauder acquired in 2014 for an undisclosed amount, has been struggling for some time. In 2022, former chief executive officer Fabrizio Freda initiated layoffs although exact numbers are unknown. At the same time, its international presence was scaled back, meaning that it is now only sold in the U.S. Glamglow also streamlined its product offering to an estimated 13 top sellers, focusing on hero and high replenishment. “This initiative will help return Glamglow to profitability and will leave a distribution point for loyal consumers to experience and purchase the brand and support future growth opportunities,” Lauder said in a statement at the time. Glamglow is part of Lauder’s trio of Califoria brands that also includes Smashbox and Too Faced. As Lauder evaluates its portfolio, it has long been speculated that this group could be considered for possible divestment. During the earnings call in August, Stéphane de La Faverie, the current president and CEO of Lauder, noted that it recently engaged an external adviser as the group considers evolving its overall brand portfolio.

Title: Aware Super, Goodman Group Launch $1.3B U.S. Logistics Platform
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/10/aware-super-goodman-logistics-industrial-california/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T22:00:54Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Two Australian titans have joined forces on a $1.3 billion logistics real estate platform that is leased to heavyweight tenants like Amazon. Aware Super, one of Australia’s largest pension fund managers, bought a 49 percent stake in the venture with Goodman Group, a global industrial and infrastructure developer. The firms will target “undersupplied” infill industrial markets within the U.S. The exact financial contribution of each firm was not disclosed. Three assets currently comprise the $1.3 billion platform, all in Southern California totaling nearly 2.8 million square feet. They include Goodman Commerce Center Long Beach, at 2401 East Wardlow Road, Goodman Commerce Center Los Angeles, at 4841 West San Fernando, and Goodman Gateway Santa Fe Springs, which makes up two contiguous properties at 12801 Excelsior Drive and 14420 Bloomfield Avenue. The properties are currently leased by the likes of Amazon, Maersk and Relativity Space. Relativity Space in 2021, for example, inked a roughly 1 million-square-foot lease at Goodman Commerce Center Long Beach. “Our U.S. business represents over 37 percent of Goodman Group’s offshore earnings and is an increasingly important part of our global investment strategy,” Gregory Goodman, Goodman Group’s CEO, said in a statement. “Alongside our long-standing investment partner, Aware Super, we see significant growth opportunities in our key U.S. infill markets to support the development of essential infrastructure in a rapidly transforming digital economy.” Goodman controls several industrial platforms and portfolios across the U.S., including one it splits with Norges Bank Investment Management. The investment arm of the Norwegian bank in early 2025 paid $1.07 billion for a 45 percent stake in a 48-building logistics stable, most of which is in Southern California. Aware Super has a more diverse U.S. investment strategy. Last summer, the pension manager, along with development partner Lendlease, secured a $316 million construction loan forHabitat, a 454,000-square-foot, mixed-use district in Culver City. In late 2022, the Aware Super and Lendlease JV landed a $360 million loan for a 36-story, 834-unit multifamily development in Brooklyn. “Through deliberate sequencing we’re establishing our reputation and presence as a global asset owner,” Alek Misev, Aware Super’s head of property, said in reference to its new logistics platform with Goodman.

Title: Economy Candy: Three generations of sweets and success
URL: https://woocommerce.com/posts/economy-candy-custom-woocommerce/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T20:47:09Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog October 1, 2025 We recently got to visit Mitchell and Skye Cohen at Economy Candy to learn about the history of their business and how they use WooCommerce. While our team was in New York, we also filmed a short interview, which you can check out below or on our YouTube channel. Want the full story? Keep on reading for all of the sweet, sweet details of their success. 🍬🍭 Please note that some quotes have been edited for clarity and brevity. Economy Candy began in the 1930s as a penny sweets cart outside a shoe and hat repair shop in New York City. Since then, three generations of the Cohen family have turned the business into a Lower East Side mainstay — with the corner of Rivington and Essex named after Mitchell’s grandfather — and national distributor of goodies from around the world. Now, Mitchell Cohen and his wife, Skye Greenfield Cohen, continue that legacy. “Starting before he could even see over the counter, Mitchell would work with his dad behind the register standing on a milk crate, tallying bills and calculating the change in his head,” Skye shared. Skye has also continued an important tradition: ensuring that her husband continued the family business, just as Mitchell’s mother and grandmother had done for their husbands. Their most recent evolution included an upgraded ecommerce strategy in March of 2020. When they overhauled their website, which luckily happened just in time for Covid-19 closures, they also updated their store operations. Economy Candy brought nearly 2,500 SKUs into their online store, live syncing their inventory management, and began using a combination of shipping and local pickup options to keep their business going (and their customers happy) through the pandemic and beyond. Economy Candy has weathered significant worldwide and local catastrophes in its 88-year history, and yet, they’re still going strong. Their enduring presence is due in large part to their commitment to their customers, maintaining the accessibility of their products through all of the challenging times. Over the past five years, they’ve added nearly 500 new products to their inventory — which now boasts an astounding 2,500 different sweets and goodies. Getting to 2,500 SKUs, however, required an operational pivot: all of their inventory operations used to reside exclusively in Mitchell’s brain. “Up until the pandemic, all of Economy Candy’s inventory was stored in Mitchell’s head,” Skye shared. “Our staff had to memorize the prices of all 2,000+ items we carried because we were still using dumb cash registers where the price of each item had to be manually entered. In 2021 we took a leap into the 21st century and upgraded to Square digital registers.” Their modernization coincided with the pandemic, which exasperated the need for efficient (and online-friendly) inventory management. Not allowed to bring staff in-store, Mitchell and Skye moved all sales online, managing fulfillment themselves. In 2021, they added Square digital registers and implemented barcode scanning, using Thrive to sync in-store sales with their ecommerce business. Economy Candy has been online since the dawn of the millennium. In their hunt for a solution that didn’t feel restricted in functionality or growth, they switched platforms several times until 2015 — when they found WooCommerce. “When WooCommerce was presented to us, it was clear that limitations would no longer be an issue. Because WooCommerce is open source, there is no ceiling. There’s no limit to what you can do, what you can customize, what you can create. And it’s been great ever since.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy Their WooCommerce store is responsible for 20 to 25% of their total sales each year, with seasonal spikes in traffic around the holidays. Thrive sits between WooCommerce and Economy Candy’s other third-party tools, and syncs sales data for in-store purchases, online transactions, and ShipStation. They’ve also integrated the site with UPS, FedEx, Route, Mailchimp, Google, and Meta. With a total of 57 active plugins and custom code, Economy Candy manages a complex network of tools and services. “It’s incredible the way that WooCommerce is able to talk to all these different programs.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy One aspect that Mitchell and Skye love about WooCommerce is the breadth of options for customization — something that comes in handy when your products might melt during warmer seasons: “Shipping chocolate in the summer is tough. It is a challenge, but one thing that Woo has been great [for], there’s a myriad of popups and messages that you can easily set up.” “[For example,] I can set a warning,” noted Skye, “for anything that’s chocolate, put this text on that page so that the person ordering it knows that this is chocolate, there is a risk of melting. Do they want to add ice? Do they want to add cold packaging? So all those plugins [allow us to] set it and forget it… And it has really made shipping chocolate much less of a heartbreak.” Their focus on customer satisfaction has been the key to their success: “Economy Candy has survived for nearly 90 years on word of mouth,” Skye shared. “Of course, what ‘word of mouth’ means has changed a bit in the last century, from literal word of mouth to now including having our customers post about us on TikTok and Instagram and having a social media presence ourselves.” To inspire that organic promotion, they follow the rule of threes: If three people give the same feedback or request, they do their best to accommodate it. This often impacts their product and inventory decisions, from importing international sweets to making sure they stock candy from their oldest customers’ youth. They take a similar approach to new product decisions, considering the selection from the customer’s point of view: Would the customer be excited to see it in store, or has someone requested something similar? Is it a unique product that they haven’t seen before? Mitchell and Skye are also mindful of future generations of their audience. Their Gen Z staff members help them stay up to date on TikTok trends and viral sweets, such as Swedish candy, freeze-dried candy, and slime lickers. As the business grows, Economy Candy continues to play to WooCommerce’s strengths. Taking advantage of all of the customization options, Mitchell and Skye know that they can change direction whenever the need arises. “Being able to pivot without recreating your website from scratch every few years, which we used to do — now we’re making tweaks on an existing platform instead of starting from scratch, and that saves a lot of money, a lot of time.”— Mitchell Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy “With WooCommerce as the central foothold of our platform and adding pieces around that, … EconomyCandy.com is customized to what EconomyCandy.com needs to be for Economy Candy customers and for Economy Candy staff to be able to operate on the backend. We are able to put in all those custom functionalities that work for our specific business.” About Ship your WooCommerce orders with confidence, save on top carriers, and automate your processes with ShipStation.

October 01, 2025 16:18 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=169949&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

Full Content:
The U.S. stock market entered the final quarter of the year near record highs, boosted by soaring AI stocks that have become increasingly critical for the market's performance. Most of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year are directly tied to the AI boom. Data storage companies Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) have seen their shares nearly triple in value this year, while Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP), two software firms that have excelled at translating AI capabilities into revenue, have more than doubled. And despite a rough start to 2025, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are up since the start of the year. The artificial intelligence boom has been the primary source of fuel propelling the bull market of the past few years. As such, the performance of most investment portfolios is increasingly tethered to the performance of AI stocks. The Magnificent Seven account for one-third of the S&P 500, and thus have an outsized influence over the broader market’s performance. And these stocks, experts say, are increasingly tied to AI. The Mag 7's “share prices are a daily referendum on whether AI is considered hype or reality,” wrote Christopher Gannatti, Global Head of Research at WisdomTree, in a recent blog post. They “are priced as if AI is not just a growth driver, but the growth driver,” Gannatti added. As such, the investments, deals and optimism propelling the AI trade are likely to be pivotal for the entire stock market in the coming months. Massive infrastructure investment from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) has been a primary source of fuel for the AI rally. Their spending has caused revenue at chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) to explode, and underpinned the narrative that AI demand is insatiable. The hyperscalers will all update investors on their capital expenditure plans when they report quarterly results in late October and early November. Alphabet and Meta each lifted their capex forecasts in their most recent earnings reports, while Microsoft and Amazon said they would continue to invest heavily in infrastructure throughout the year. Tax changes codified by the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which empowers companies to immediately write off infrastructure investments, could give them reason to lift capex further. Experts note immediate write-offs should boost free cash flow, allowing companies to invest even more in AI. Hyperscalers have had a few months to figure out how the bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, will affect their finances and, thus, investments. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers, including Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV), will spend $490 billion on infrastructure, up from their prior estimate of $420 billion. “We expect the major hyperscalers to reflect this incremental spend in guidance discussions during 3Q results,” the analysts wrote. Unexpected increases to capex guidance could reinforce Wall Street’s bullishness on the semiconductor, software, and energy companies benefiting most from the AI buildout. “We’re seeing a bit of an evolution” in the drivers of the AI rally, Gannatti told Investopedia. “It kind of started with the hyperscalers—Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet—saying, ‘We have a certain amount of cash flow. We’re going to make investments.’” Today, Gannatti says, AI companies are investing in one another, and using those investments to buy goods and services from each other. The most notable example of this was announced last month, when OpenAI committed to deploying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems to train and run its next-generation models. In return, Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as capacity comes online, effectively subsidizing the start-up's infrastructure expenses. “So there’s a bit of circularity,” says Gannatti, who notes there’s a risk to these sorts of deals. “None of these things are guaranteed,” he said, including OpenAI’s commitment to spend $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud computing services over the next five years. “If the business environment changes, the music might need to stop—not necessarily forever, but for a while.” Investors have worried about an AI bubble for quite some time, and the rally faces the risk that AI sentiment sours, weighing on investment and depressing stock valuations. So far, tech companies have been able to show investors enough benefit from AI to keep Wall Street comfortable with their spending, said Gannatti. “But you feel like you’re always one earnings cycle away from a negative interpretation of a certain announcement,“ the kind of less-than-ideal development that throws cold water on a red-hot market, he added. Several events this year have briefly appeared to be this watershed moment. In January, investors caught wind of Chinese start-up DeepSeek’s super-efficient reasoning model, briefly calling into question the wisdom of Silicon Valley’s AI spending. And AI stocks swooned over the summer when an MIT study found that 95% of corporate generative AI pilot projects failed to deliver any material return on investment. Yet, on every occasion, investors have shaken off the panic and continued to pile into AI stocks. There are reasons to be optimistic that today’s AI boom is more resilient than the bubbles to which it is often compared. “The positive is it’s not being financed by debt, at least not yet,” said Gannatti. “So it's not like the fiber optic buildouts in, say, 1999 and 2000, where the companies didn't even have the fundamentals.” Instead, the companies funding the AI buildout have some of the biggest businesses, healthiest balance sheets, and deepest pockets of any companies on earth. Their hugely profitable non-AI businesses could mitigate the fallout of a shift in sentiment toward AI.

Title: Morgan Stanley: Adobe’s Future at Risk Due to AI

Morgan Stanley has downgraded Adobe’s stock rating, cutting its price target for the software giant amidst a perceived inability to stand out amidst the rise of generative AI. According to a report from The Street, top Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss noted a growing gap between Adobe’s AI development (and promises) and reported revenue in its Digital Media division. “Since that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio,” Weiss writes in his report. The full report notes that Adobe’s revenue which it can tie directly to its AI-based efforts has been lagging, and monetization is going slowly. Compounding issues are growing from competitors like Canva, Google, and Meta, who all have introduced AI-based features that they can more directly tie to revenue growth. As a result, Morgan Stanley lowered their price target for Adobe from $520 to $450. It doesn’t look like it’s close to even hitting that lower mark, however, as the stock has been steadily falling in the past couple of weeks. It hit $353 per share on September 24 and sits at $344 on October 1. Adobe’s current weakened situation is likely a product of its own making. For the last year, Adobe has been shouting loudly about its AI development and the power of its in-house generative AI platform, Firefly. However, after updates and iterations, Firefly remains significantly behind competitors in terms of usefulness. While its select subject and remove tools have become a lot better over the last couple of months, for most of the year, its generative tools have been downright ghastly, resulting in Eldritch nightmares that don’t solve the problems they should. Its AI-based generative video tool is still far from being usable. The AI situation at Adobe has been so behind that the company recently opened up its platform to use other Generative AI tools — most recently Nano Banana — diminishing the value of its “responsible” AI to the degree that Adobe seems less concerned with it now than ever, especially as pressure mounts to make good on its AI-based revenue promises. In June, Adobe finally started tracking generative AI use through its apps via credits, which will very likely be an indicator that Adobe can use to tie AI to revenue. But if those numbers aren’t high and showing an upward trend, investors still won’t be happy. That’s tricky for the software company, as the main users of its Digital Media division are still artists, many of whom are less than happy with the proliferation of generative AI that has been trained on human work, effectively stealing knowledge so it can be sold back to them. Adobe is not wholly beloved by its customers either, who regularly clamor for someone else to step in and give Adobe competition. Its recent foray into social media network Bluesky is the best example of how Adobe’s customers feel as the company was hit with so much backlash after joining that it was effectively forced off the platform.

October 1, 2025 3:00pm by Barry Ritholtz At The Money: The Flood of New ETFs (October 1, 2025) There will be nearly 1,000 new ETFs issued this year. Most of these are NOT the usual low-cost passive indices, but tend to be complex, expensive active funds in an ETF wrapper. These include leveraged directional bets, options, derivatives, and a whole raft of exotic strategies. Full transcript below. ~~~ About this week’s guest: Dave Nadig is President and Director of Research at ETF.com, and he shares with us how investors should navigate all of these new products. Dave helped design and market some of the first exchange-traded funds. He is the author of “A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds” for the CFA Institute.

And find the entire musical playlist of all the songs I have used on At the Money on Spotify TRANSCRIPT: Barry Ritholtz: There were 600 new ETFs launched in the first eight months of 2025. And it’s gonna get worse because so many more ETFs are coming out next year. The growth has been explosive. What does this mean for investors? I have the perfect person to discuss this with. Dave Nadig is president and head of research at ETF.com. He has been tracking the ETF industry pretty much since his its beginning and is well known as an expert in the space. So Dave, let’s talk a little bit about what’s been going on. Most ETF assets are and will likely continue to be cheap, index based products. That’s the legacy for investors: Low cost beta. Is this the future of ETFs or are we going in a different direction? Dave Nadig: I think most of the money is gonna continue to flow into low cost asset allocation targets, right? The S&P 500 broad bonds, broad commodities at very, very cheap institutional prices. It’s just hard to beat that. It’s one of the best deals going in asset management in the investing world. And so whether you’re an individual mom and pop investor just trading your own account, or whether you’re the Harvard endowment, anything in between. Cheap beta is still probably gonna be important to your portfolio, and ETFs are gonna remain the best wrapper for that experience. However, this industry is not gonna take that lying down and desperately wants to make money. Most of the new products, the new launches you talked about, the 600 will probably have 800, 900 by the end of the year. Almost all of those products are very expensive. Doesn’t mean some of them aren’t good, but they’re all very expensive. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about that. New products are coming out with what you described as quote, insanely high fees that the big revenue winners are likely not the firms you think of when someone says ETF at a cocktail party. What does this mean for investors? What does this mean for the industry? Are there really massive profits to be had here? Dave Nadig: There are pretty huge profits to be had here. And if you look at where I, I like to look at revenue based on flow. Meaning like last month, X amount of money came in, what was the revenue implied by that money and the implied revenue of the industry? Now has, you know, probably about 25% of the implied revenue from Flow is going to products that cost over 1%. (Really?!) So that means there are a lot of investors buying products that cost over 1%. And the reason that’s an issue for investors is not that nothing is worth that fee, but that what’s getting launched tends to be very speculative. We’re not talking about core investing, building blocks; we’re talking about ETFs that use leverage or ETFs that use the derivatives markets to shape your pattern of returns to get you more income than you might otherwise be able to, e.g., “Selling volatility” Those types of products are expensive and while they may be useful like, like a really sharp knife in the drawer can be really useful when you got that chicken bone you gotta get through. It’s not a one size fits all thing. I have some concern that individual investors see the marketing from the industry, which is really exclusively focused on those expensive products and gets sort of suckered into ’em. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what, what is transformative? What is innovative in ETFs over the past few years? What trends do you see shaping 2026 and beyond? What is the biggest new type of ETF that’s coming out? Dave Nadig: There’s really three buckets of, of hot development from a, from a what could you as an investor target. Crypto we have to talk about. Not only do we now have, um, hundreds of billions of dollars tracking crypto in various capacities, whether it’s spot Bitcoin, which is where most of those flows have gone, but now we’re talking about Ethereum and Solana. We’re talking about stake diversions where you’re taking your Solana and you’re putting it into a contract to earn fees off of or earn interest off of it. That ecosystem of crypto products is going to get very complex very quickly. The SEC has put out accelerated listing standards; default listing standards, which will allow probably the next 10 to 20 coins on the market cap list to be launched as spot ETFs. So those will all be launched within the next six to 12 months before you it gonna be a free for all Barry Ritholtz: Before you move off crypto. I have to ask about BlackRock’s Ibit – it was 5 billion at launch. It’s something like 82 billion already. Is this the fastest ever asset accumulator of any ETF that’s been launched? Dave Nadig: It’s pretty close if it’s not the winner. I, I certainly think on a, on a pure dollar basis, uh, I can’t think of anything that has had that kind of ramp. GLD when it first came out was one of the first to a billion and then the first to 5 billion, and that broke a lot of records. I think Ibit and Bitcoin as a class has really kind of blown all those things out of the water and it’s been, it’s been, I think, beneficial for the most part, and an orderly process. I think having these Bitcoin ETFs has helped investors understand it. Um, I’m hearing from bigger as bigger institutions, bigger advisors, they love the ETF because it solves all of their custody issues, right? Everything stays in the same account. They don’t have to worry about having on chain assets. So while crypto purists may not be into it, I think the average investor is way better suited to get their little bit of crypto exposure in that ETF wrapper. And, and you mentioned what the SEC is permitting, not just in crypto, but across the boards. I, I read your regular writings and one of the things you had said is. We have a “Incredibly permissive launch environment.” What does this mean in terms of the sort of things we can see in ETFs, either with leverage two x three x in verse two x? What, what does this permissive environment mean for what ETFs are gonna get launched? Dave Nadig: It means we’re gonna get a lot of ’em. We’re gonna launch “all the things,” as I like to say. (All the things!) Uh, the, the, the biggest thing we’ve had is this move towards single stock ETFs. And, and for people who might be confused by that, it’s not that you’re buying an Apple ETF to invest in just Apple ’cause you can obviously just buy Apple to do that. You’re buying an Apple ETF that maybe gives you two x Apple exposure or minus. Two x apple exposure. So when it goes, you goes down, you go up, or you’re writing options on your Apple position so that you can get some extra income. Or you’re doing a combination of both so that you can only get, you know, you get 2X the upside and minus 1X the downside but with caps involved, ’cause you’re selling a lot of options along the way. Anyway you can imagine mixing and matching these kinds of patterns of returns. The combination of leverage. Income and protection around a single stock is going to be launched. If you think about it, we’ve got 500 stocks in the S&P 500. There are about six different flavors you can think of for each individual stock. That’s a couple thousand ETFs we’re gonna have to keep track of, assuming there’s only one of each flavor, and this industry loves to compete against each other. Legitimately, I think by this time next year, we could have several thousand more ETFs than we do right now. Barry Ritholtz: More ETFs than there are actually stocks. Dave Nadig: Huge already. They’re absolutely, I mean, we’ve been under, we haven’t had 5,000 stocks in the Wilshire in a long time. I think 3,500. 500 or so. We’re gonna see all those single stock products, which are, for the most part, trading vehicles, right? If you’re a day trader, there’s lots of value in there. If you are trying to, you know, monetize a long term position, there’s some value in those kinds of covered call strategies. They’re all very expensive. They’re very inappropriate for most long-term investor from an allocation perspective, but sharp, useful trading tools for a certain class of trader. Barry Ritholtz: I keep reading some of the things you’re penning about share class relief. Explain what this means and why this is another flood of new ETFs that are coming out. Dave Nadig: Let’s pick an example. Like DFA Dimensional was late to the ETF party, very well known sort of in the nineties for being one of those shops where you could only buy them through an advisor who’d gone through their coursework. They made the shift to convert some of their mutual funds to ETFs a couple years ago, and were very successful at it. Now, why didn’t they convert all of them? Because a lot of the DFA products end up in 401k plans. And if you’re in a 401k plan, that means you need to be able to get fractional shares, which is really easy in a mutual fund and impossible in an ETF. The only way to get the efficiencies of the ETF structure into those mutual funds is a share class: an ETF share class pointing at the same pool of assets. That’s how a lot of Vanguard ETFs are built. They had a patent, which is now expired. The SEC has 70 odd applications from other players in the industry to basically duplicate things the way Vanguard does. They’ve made it very clear that. Imminent, I would suggest by the end of the year, at the very latest, we’ll see this first one’s approved and that will then be a flood because that becomes a very, very simple boilerplate piece of paperwork to file a new share class and get it trading on NYSE, Nasdaq, or CBOE. We’ll just see a lot of those. I would suspect by the end of the year, we could have maybe a thousand of those individual share class ETFs turned on if all of the people who have filed. Converted all or share classed all of the things they could. It would be about five or 6,000 new ETFs. Barry Ritholtz: That’s really intriguing. I have to ask a question, and you’re the one who’s really schooled me on this. If mutual funds were created today, they probably wouldn’t be approved. Explain the problem with mutual funds and why ETFs are arguably so much superior. Dave Nadig: Well, the biggest problem with funds is their tax fairness. It’s the issue with a fund is that if you as a big investor, let’s say you own 20% of the Dave Mutual Fund and you decide I’m terrible and you want out, well, the mutual fund me has to now go sell a bunch of securities to give you back your 20% of my fund all that cash that you’re gonna want. That engenders generally a bunch of capital gains. Those capital gains now have to be distributed to. All the people who were left, the people you abandoned buried, they end up paying taxes ’cause you left because you created a capital gain for everybody. Now it’s not that those are taxes that would never be paid, it’s just you’re paying them earlier than you would otherwise ’cause you get to reduce your basis. So. Individual investors in a mutual fund can often get tax distributions through no fault of their own, through no action of their own, simply because other investors go in and out in an ETF. That simply doesn’t happen. So it is a simply a fairer mechanism. The ETF also brings other things that are helpful, like the ability to wash out some cap gains by doing so-called creation redemption or heartbeat trading. That’s a little feature of ETFs that makes them very tax efficient. And of course liquidity and transparency and all those other things. But the big reason mutual funds would probably get the kibosh today is they’re inherently less fair in terms of how they treat individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: Even if I don’t sell my mutual fund, but other people have, I incur capital gains. Dave Nadig: A hundred percent. Now you get, again, you get to change your basis. So when you go to sell, you’ll pay less tax gains. But I don’t know about you. I prefer paying taxes later, hopefully never, or maybe after I’m dead. But not today. Barry Ritholtz: Final question. It sounds like the future of ETFs are pretty much anything. Anything you wanna do, sometimes cheap. Always very liquid, but can be accomplished very well with an ETF. Is this the future of asset management? Dave Nadig: I think so, I think the ETF structure is the most efficient vehicle we’ve come up with for taking exposures and getting them traded on exchanges. It’s hard for me to see how we’re going to make it any more efficient tokenization crypto. Sometime down the line, we’ll replace some of what we’ve done with ETFs, but we’ll largely duplicate it and it will just do it in a different fashion. The, the ETF structure is where you’re going to probably get almost all of your exposures for the foreseeable future with some very strange edge cases. Things like some private credit or maybe some real estate that you can’t trade daily. There’ll be some edge cases. Everything else is gonna be an ETF. Barry Ritholtz: If we’re talking about the future of ETFs, we’re really talking about the future of asset allocation and investing. For the most part, the big money is in the low-cost passive indexes that charge 3, 4, 5 basis points. But the fastest growing space in ETF-world are active funds. Our alternative funds are all sorts of niche. Areas, some of which are pretty pricey, a hundred, 125 basis points. Directional bets leverage two x three x inverse bets. Those are really special use cases. Tread carefully if you’re playing in those spaces. Use ETFs for what they’re really good at: Getting you low-cost exposure to inexpensive indices. Tread lightly when you go into the pricier, wilder stuff, those are potential accidents waiting to happen. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Title: Grassley, Durbin Take Aim at Tech, Finance and Retail Sectors for Favoring H-1B Visa Holders over American Workers

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/01/2025 10:14:25 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ranking Member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) are scrutinizing major corporations for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labor visa petitions after conducting mass layoffs of American employees. “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years … At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the United States. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers concluded. Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years … At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the United States. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers concluded. Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders. Walmart, which cited “technological changes” when announcing it would terminate 1,500 employees earlier this year. In fiscal year 2025, Walmart applied for and received approval to hire 2,390 foreign H1-B employees.

According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders. Walmart, which cited “technological changes” when announcing it would terminate 1,500 employees earlier this year. In fiscal year 2025, Walmart applied for and received approval to hire 2,390 foreign H1-B employees.

Title: First Brands’ Fall Renews Concerns Over Murky Trade Finance
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/first-brands-fall-renews-concerns-over-murky-trade-finance-11759335358613.html
Time Published: 2025-10-01T16:15:58Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- When the auto-parts supplier First Brands Group filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, one name popped up in the documents again and again: Raistone. The little-known firm helps businesses secure short-term financing as they wait for customer payments to come through or seek to delay paying suppliers. On Tuesday, the New York-based company let go dozens of its workers as the deals it worked on for First Brands came under scrutiny. The collapse of First Brands is only the most recent instance of a firm like Raistone facilitating apparently low-risk transactions that have led to problems for companies and lenders in what is known as trade finance. Late last year, a Raistone competitor, Stenn Technologies, collapsed in dramatic fashion after promoting mundane corporate lending products that proved to be anything but. The biggest bust in the industry came in 2021, when Greensill Capital filed for insolvency after channeling bank deposits and insurance funds into short-term loans to risky companies, ultimately contributing to the forced sale of Credit Suisse Group AG. Raistone has a working familiarity with these past problems. It offered to take on stranded clients of Stenn, and the founder of Raistone, Dave Skirzenski, was one of the first employees at Greensill. He left that firm years before it collapsed, and there are no allegations of wrongdoing against either Raistone or First Brands. A few of Raistone’s workers previously held positions at Stenn, according to a review of their LinkedIn profiles. The links between these disconnected corporate crashes underscore the questions surrounding the tools and platforms that offer companies easy access to short-term corporate financing, often tied to some promised future revenue. While intermediaries like Raistone and Greensill aim to make these markets more efficient and available to a wider array of businesses, they can end up obscuring some of the risks for borrowers, lenders and even the platforms themselves. The innovation in trade finance is “supposed to be good, but oftentimes, those financial innovations are being taken advantage of and companies kind of hide information, take on more risk,” said Ben Lourie, a professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine’s business school. “Sometimes that risk explodes,” he added. Raistone and First Brands both declined to comment. Warning Signals Regulators and accounting experts have sounded alarms for years about the growth of off-balance sheet financing techniques that companies use to manage their short-term cash flow. Transactions between investment-grade companies and lenders carry low risk, but cracks can emerge for businesses on shakier financial footing. The funding for these deals has largely come from asset managers and insurance companies, rather than the banks that used to provide it, creating additional visibility problems for investors and regulators. In 2022, after the collapse of Greensill, US accounting rulemakers required companies to disclose the size and key terms of one kind of financing offered by Greensill called supply chain financing, which generally involves taking out short-term loans to pay suppliers. Even with the new rules, though, many of First Brands’ creditors felt they were left in the dark leading up to the bankruptcy. The court filings this week are providing many lenders with the first real glimpse at what went wrong with First Brands, which saw the value of its loans drop by more than half in a matter of weeks after concerns began to circulate about its off-balance sheet financing. The Michigan-based company, which owns car parts brands such as Carter fuel pumps and Trico wiper blades, was thought to have about $6 billion in debt. But when it filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night, there were over $10 billion in outstanding liabilities, and just $1 billion to $10 billion of assets. The company is owned by a businessman who kept a low profile, Patrick James, and it channeled much of its financing through a network of intermediaries owned by James. Short-Term Cash While there’s no indication of wrongdoing, a newly appointed board committee is now investigating the company’s use of roughly $2.3 billion of off-balance sheet financing, Chief Restructuring Officer Charles Moore said in a court filing. Some of the inventory backing these facilities “may have been commingled” with collateral securing a separate asset-backed loan facility. The declaration filed on Tuesday morning showed that $2.3 billion of First Brands’ liabilities were tied to a practice known as factoring that can turn expected future income, like outstanding receipts, into immediate cash — a sort of corporate payday loan. An industry group, the Secured Finance Network, reported this week that the total funds in use in factoring rose 13% between the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025. First Brands also owed another $800 million to creditors that offered supply-chain finance, the borrowing tool companies use to pay suppliers. Many of these arrangements ran through Raistone, which is listed as the point of contact for several of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, including the three largest, with combined claims of over half a billion dollars. While Raistone’s precise relationship to these creditors is not detailed in the documents, its website describes it as an administrator originating and placing such debt with its client investors. Unsecured Creditors Raistone was founded in 2017 by Skirzenski, who, in a 2020 interview, said that he imagined it as “the Amazon Web Services of trade finance,” standing in between the various players in the market. It advertises its services to companies that want to “get paid quickly without taking on debt,” and to investors looking to offer funding with a “short tenor,” “low default rates” and “no mark-to-market risk.” The company says it has offered nearly $15 billion in financing to date. While Raistone is typically only the intermediary in these transactions, it is also separately listed as one of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, for an “undetermined amount” tied to both factoring and supply-chain finance. Skirzenski would have been familiar with this mix of businesses at Greensill Capital, which he joined in 2013, according to his personal LinkedIn profile. After he left in 2017, Greensill grew into one of the hottest startups in the fintech industry, with a big investment from SoftBank Group Corp., ties to the highest ranks of the British government and a fleet of corporate jets. Greensill’s high profile founder, Lex Greensill, promoted the safe nature of his business lending against future cashflow, which appeared to be secured by the invoices themselves. However, it turned out that much of the money was lent against predicted future income, rather than actual invoices. This became a particular problem because Greensill’s business was largely concentrated on a handful of risky companies. Some of the same issues cropped up at Stenn, another UK trade finance fintech, though it also faced accusations of faked client lists and fraud. When Stenn went under last year, Raistone put up a website for “former Stenn clients left looking for an alternative” and promised interest rates as low as 6%. --With assistance from Lucca de Paoli.

Title: Yahoo Fantasy Basketball: Draft strategy for new High Score format
URL: https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/article/yahoo-fantasy-basketball-draft-strategy-for-new-high-score-format-160632486.html

Manage your account ... Welcome to Yahoo's High Score fantasy basketball. If you've been playing fantasy hoops for a while, get ready to unlearn some old habits. This game isn't about nightly grind and steady production — it's about chasing peak performances and embracing the fun and chaos of the NBA week. You can learn more in my High Score 101, but the rules are simple: Your weekly score is calculated using only the single-best fantasy performance from each of your six starters. That’s it. A player can have three bad games and one amazing game, and you only get the points from the amazing one. This changes everything. [High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league] Now, let's explore tips to help you in your High Score drafts — I also have in-season strategy, when you’re ready to dive deeper. As a reminder, the High Score scoring format is as follows: Points: 1 point Rebounds: 1 point Assists: 2 points Blocks: 3 points Steals: 3 points And here's how the starting lineup breaks down: Guard Guard Frontcourt Frontcourt Frontcourt FLEX/UTIL There are also four bench spots. 101 on the format In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Join a league now With High Score's streamlined and positionless format, there are just two guard spots, three frontcourt spots and a single flex/utility spot. There's no need to worry about filling every position (PG, SG, SF, PF or C) like traditional fantasy basketball formats. This gives you way more freedom to build your lineup your way — whether you want to stack up on guards, bulk up on versatile forwards or mix and match based on your favorite draft strategy. Or, better yet … Drafting players with both guard and frontcourt eligibility is a savvy move in High Score. With only 30 of these versatile options available within the top 150, you get the freedom to easily adjust your lineup when injuries or rest days pop up. Here's the list of players with dual eligibility whom I’d target: Scottie Barnes Jaylen Brown Amen Thompson Desmond Bane Josh Hart Dyson Daniels Paul George Cam Thomas Brandon Ingram Bennedict Mathurin Devin Vassell Shaedon Sharpe Norman Powell Andrew Wiggins Bradley Beal Christian Braun Ayo Dosunmu Nickeil Alexander-Walker Bilal Coulibaly Jaylen Wells Quentin Grimes Kyshawn George Prioritize these players on draft day for an additional edge in High Score. Let's start with one of the biggest changes you need to know: Guards are more valuable than ever. The scoring updates in High Score are a massive boost for playmakers and perimeter defenders. Assists are now worth a full 2 points each, a big jump from the previous 1.5, and turnovers no longer deduct points. This is a game-changer. This scoring tweak turns high-assist guards into prized fantasy assets. Trae Young and Cade Cunningham — two high-assist, high-turnover guards — are even better in High Score. But it doesn't stop there. Steals are worth a hefty 3 points, and guards tend to rack up steals at a higher rate than most frontcourt players. So, a guard who drops between 6-10 assists, plus a steal and no turnovers to worry about, is already giving you a huge point boost before you even count their points and rebounds. This doesn't mean you should ignore big men entirely. In fact, it makes certain types of frontcourt players even more valuable. Guys who are the hub of their offense, like Paolo Banchero, Domantas Sabonis or Alperen Şengün, also get a bump in High Score. Your draft plan should prioritize these assist-heavy players, whether they bring the ball up the court or facilitate from the high post. In other formats, a player who misses a game or two can be a weekly disaster. That fear leads to players with injury risk, like Joel Embiid, sliding down draft boards. In High Score, that risk practically vanishes. Since you only need one great game from a starter each week, "load management" and minor absences become far less concerning. Think about Embiid. He averages over 50 fantasy points per game when he plays, but his availability concerns often push him beyond the fifth round in traditional drafts. In High Score, he’s a first-round talent, no question. All you need is one of his signature dominant performances per week to get elite production from that roster spot. He can play once, drop a 50-burger and you're set for the week. This mindset applies throughout the draft. Look for players who have week-winning potential. Jalen Green is a perfect mid-round example. He's known for being inconsistent, but he’s also capable of erupting for a massive scoring night at any moment. In other formats, his duds would frustrate you. Here, you only care about the peak. One 40-point game is all it takes to make him a valuable asset. Your goal is to build a roster full of players who can go off, not just show up. These are reliable, night-in and night-out contributors who grab rebounds and block a couple of shots. In many fantasy formats, they provide a stable floor. In High Score, the Rudy Gobert types aren't as valuable. The scoring system devalues one of their primary contributions: Rebounds are now worth just 1 point compared to 1.2 previously. While Gobert might have a spike game with 20+ rebounds or four blocks, the overall offensive game for traditional frontcourt players is limited. You generally know what you're getting — a low-end double-double. That predictable production just doesn't move the needle in a format where you're chasing explosive point totals. Focus on bigs who are more involved in the offense or who contribute across multiple categories, not just the traditional big-man stats. Let someone else in your league draft these "safe" centers. High Score features smaller rosters (10 players in total, including four bench spots), which might seem restrictive, but it actually gives you incredible freedom in the later rounds of your draft. You don't need to waste those final picks on safe, low-upside players just to fill out your roster. Instead, it’s time to go big-game hunting. Use your late-round picks to swing for the fences. Target volatile players who have the potential for spike performances. Rookies with a clear path to scoring, like Wizards rookie Tre Johnson, are my ideal targets. He might be inconsistent early on, but his role is expected to grow and he has the talent to deliver a 30-point game out of nowhere. The beauty of this strategy lies in its low-risk nature. If your lottery ticket doesn't pan out, the short bench makes it an easy decision to drop him for a hot player on the waiver wire. You're not tied to your late-round picks. Take a chance on a player who could have a few huge weeks. Those are the swings that can separate you from the rest of the league. While chasing points and assists is crucial, don't forget about the defensive side of the ball. Steals and blocks — affectionately known as "stocks" in fantasy basketball — are both worth 3 points apiece. These stats can be random, but they add up quickly and can be the difference in a close matchup. Prioritizing players who contribute on both ends of the floor is a savvy move. Guards who are elite defenders, like Derrick White, are incredibly valuable. He can fill up the stat sheet with points and assists while also adding a couple of steals and a block, providing a well-rounded and high-scoring fantasy line. In the frontcourt, look for versatile defenders who can do a bit of everything. Players like the Thompson twins (Amen and Ausar) are great examples. They have the athleticism to block shots and the quick hands to rack up steals, giving you multiple avenues to score fantasy points. If you miss out on some of the top-tier offensive stars, pivoting to elite defensive players is a fantastic way to build a competitive and balanced roster, should you miss out on some of the high-volume scorers.

The broader tech, media, and telecommunications sector is one of the hottest corners of the market, and UBS shared its top picks this week. Within the S&P 500, tech stocks are up 20% year-to-date, while communications services stocks are up 22%. That handily outpaces the broader index, which is up just 13% from levels at the start of the year. In a note to clients, analysts at UBS highlighted 10 buy-rated stocks within the two sectors, which represented the bank's "highest-conviction calls" in that segment of the market. The calls also reflected companies where UBS had a "differentiated view" or proprietary data that supported its bullish call, analysts said. Here are the top stocks on the bank's radar: Ticker: NIQ Year-to-date performance: -16% Predicted upside: +56% Analyst reasoning: "Following its 2021 transformation, including ~$920m in investments ($400m in technology, $520m across deals, and Fetch), NIQ is positioned for ~5% organic CC revenue growth (2024-27E). We model adjusted EBITDA margin improving +550bps to 24.1% by 2027E, driven by cost efficiencies and equity quality enhancements." Ticker: DIS Year-to-date performance: +2% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "We remain bullish on Disney shares and continue to view parks as a value driver (which should improve as new attractions/cruise capacity comes online)," analysts wrote. "This supports our view that Disney can grow EPS at a ~17% CAGR through F27 vs. the Street's ~13%." Ticker: AMT Year-to-date performance: +6% Predicted upside: +35% Analyst reasoning: "AMT is poised to benefit from increased U.S. carrier activity (AT&T amendments post-Echostar spectrum acquisition; VZ/TMUS densification) and accelerated international growth, driving 6-8% annual AFFO/sh growth from '25-'27E, up from ~1% recently." Ticker: AMZN Year-to-date performance: -0.4% Predicted upside: +23% Analyst reasoning: "Amazon appears most poised for growth due to investments in e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and satellites. As revenue scales, upward revisions to operating profit and FCF could outpace peers. We project operating margins of 11.3% in 2025E, 12.9% in 2026E, and 15.7% in 2027E, with potential upside if incremental revenue generation exceeds current forecasts." Ticker: APP Year-to-date performance: +108% Predicted upside: +13% Analyst reasoning: "Over the next 12-months, we expect APP to execute on a combination of demand and supply expansion initiatives that could improve the efficacy of Axon 2.0 and in-turn deliver estimate and multiple upsides." Ticker: MA Year-to-date performance: +8% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "Within the Payments, Processors, & FinTech sector, Mastercard provides diversified exposure across spend categories and benefits from robust growth in value-added services (~40% of business, high-teens growth). Key strengths include strong profitability (~55-70% EBIT margins, high FCF conversion), competitive moats, scalability, EPS resilience, GAAP-like EPS quality, and expansion into new flows (e.g., Mastercard Move)." Ticker: MRVL Year-to-date performance: -26% Predicted upside: +14% Analyst reasoning: "Marvell is well positioned to grow its Amazon custom ASIC revenue in '26, driven by Tranium2+ exceeding 1MM units next year." Ticker: SNOW Year-to-date performance: +42% Predicted upside: 27% Analyst reasoning: "We're Buy-rated on Snowflake shares, supported by tailwinds such as 1) rising customer focus on data migration and modernization driven by GenAI, 2) resilient AI and data spending amid macro uncertainty, and 3) growth from new products alongside stable core consumption, enabling high-20%/30% growth in FY26/CY25E (vs consensus at 27%)." Ticker: VRNS Year-to-date performance: +28% Predicted upside: +22% Analyst reasoning: "We rate Varonis shares as Buy, driven by 1) rising enterprise focus on data security, supported by AI adoption and dedicated budgets, 2) expected growth beyond conversions post-CY25 via expanded platform features and data store coverage (CY26 revs growth modeled at 21% vs Cons. 18%), and 3) increasing AI deployments enhancing demand for M365 Copilot security through its Microsoft partnership and other AI-driven SKUs." Ticker: BRZE Year-to-date performance: -31% Predicted upside: +43% Analyst reasoning: "We believe BRZE's shares are attractive at 4x CY26 revenue, trading at a discount to SMID apps peers at 11x despite superior growth prospects (20%+ vs. peers in high-teens). Sustained 20%+ revenue growth is supported by customer and partner field checks showing teens-plus spend growth." Jump to

Title: A Northwestern grad shares how she landed job interviews at Uber, Meta, and Amazon — and a tech role at Salesforce

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Karishma Mandal wanted to be at the center of the tech world — working in AI at a big-name company in San Francisco. So she moved across the country — and tapped every job search strategy in her toolbox, hoping to land an offer. Mandal's career journey — which would include interviews at Uber, Meta, Amazon, and Salesforce — began when she moved to the US from India in 2021 to pursue a master's in engineering management at Northwestern University. After graduating in January 2023, she began working full-time in March of that year as a product manager at a consulting firm in Chicago — before leaving for a senior product manager role at a healthcare company that November. The position was remote, with team members spread across the country. In her first few months on the job, Mandal said she missed working with people in person — and the time zone differences made it even harder to connect with colleagues. At the same time, she kept hearing about tech meetups and professional events happening regularly in San Francisco — opportunities she said were harder to find in Chicago. There was also the unavoidable buzz around generative AI, the future of which seemed increasingly centered in the Bay Area. San Francisco, she realized, was where she needed to be. So she started planning a move, with the goal of eventually landing an AI-focused role at a large tech company. "I felt like, as a tech person, I had to be in San Francisco," said the 29-year-old. But one big hurdle stood in the way of her plan: the tough tech job market. Mandal is among the many tech professionals who've struggled to find work or to change jobs in recent years. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the start of 2025, global tech companies — including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon — have collectively laid off more than 80,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have coincided with a broader slowdown in white-collar hiring. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are now hiring at nearly the slowest pace since 2014. Still, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Mandal shared how she landed interviews at several tech giants — and ultimately secured a role at Salesforce. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above. You can also find more of our job market coverage below: In May 2024, Mandal moved to San Francisco while continuing to work remotely for the healthcare company. She said she didn't start job hunting right away, in part because the move was overwhelming. There were boxes to unpack, and she didn't have any friends or family in the area. Instead, she focused on settling in and building her social and professional network from scratch. "When I came to San Francisco, I really had no one," she said. When Mandal began her job search in September 2024, she sensed the tech hiring landscape wasn't in her favor. To gain traction, she believed she needed to connect directly with hiring managers and recruiters. Rather than simply applying to job listings, she looked for people who were actively posting about open product manager roles on LinkedIn. One trick she used was searching "product manager + hiring" — a combination that filtered for posts containing both terms. Then she'd apply LinkedIn's "past 24 hours" filter to surface the newest listings. To take things a step further, she'd tweak the URL manually — changing the number of seconds from 86,400 (24 hours) to 3,600 (1 hour) — to see posts from the past hour. Once she found a post of interest, Mandal said she'd message the recruiter or hiring manager — explaining why she was interested in the role and why she thought she'd be a good fit. In addition to filtering LinkedIn posts, Mandal applied the same logic to the platform's job listings tab — using filters to uncover the newest openings. Based on conversations with recruiters and her network, she said she thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role. Many recruiters, she said, are far more likely to closely review the 20th application than the 200th or the 2,000th. Career experts previously told Business Insider that being among the first applicants could give candidates an edge. Mandal was also strategic about how she submitted applications. She said an HR professional at one company told her they prioritized applications submitted directly through their website over those sourced via LinkedIn — even if the candidate was redirected there from a LinkedIn post. Mandal figured following that advice couldn't hurt her chances. To get an extra edge, Mandal said she used the referral platform Refer.me to secure referrals for roles at McKinsey and Best Buy. A free account allows users to send one referral request a week to employees at a wide range of companies. "You have to be early, you have to be through the direct website, and you have to get a referral if you can," Mandal said of her job search strategies. Over time, Mandal's job search strategies began to pay off. She said reaching out to an Amazon recruiter and an Uber hiring manager on LinkedIn — after seeing their posts about open roles — helped her secure interviews at both companies. A separate referral from a Meta employee — sourced outside Refer.me — led to another interview. Business Insider has verified her interview offers by reviewing emails she received from the respective companies. Mandal said her Uber interview included a case study involving AI tools built around user communication data, while Meta's featured questions about measuring the performance of AI features on Instagram. The Amazon interview, she said, focused more on the company's leadership principles. These interviews didn't ultimately lead to offers. But in late 2024, Mandal messaged a Salesforce recruiter on LinkedIn who had posted about an AI-related product manager role — and eventually heard back to schedule an interview. Over the next several weeks, Mandal said she went through a seven-round interview process that included a design exercise where she was asked to create an AI-powered lawn mower; conversations with the engineering, product, and AI teams; and a final interview with a senior leader. "They're not limited to behavioral questions," she said of Salesforce interviews. "Most hiring managers want to see real expertise." Mandal said she received an offer from Salesforce around the end of the year, which included a six-figure salary about 40% higher than what she earned in her previous role. She started full-time in January. While San Francisco's high cost of living has been frustrating at times, she said the career benefits have made relocating from Chicago worthwhile. "If you are trying to make a big career move in tech, I'd recommend living in San Francisco and seeing how you can leverage your network," she said. Jump to

Title: Czech Elections Could Shift Country Away From Pro-European Path, Impacting Support For Ukraine
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/10/mil-251001-rferl01.htm

By Rikard Jozwiak October 01, 2025 When Czech voters head to ballot boxes this weekend, many fear the country may turn away from its pro-European path, taking away one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters as its battle to repel invading Russian forces nears the four-year mark. Most polls indicate that billionaire Andrej Babis and his populist ANO party will win the parliamentary elections on October 3-4 with around 30 percent of the vote. That means Babis would have to form a coalition government with fringe parties, which would bring the country closer to Viktor Orban's Hungary and Robert Fico's Slovakia in terms of its outlook on Ukraine, potentially stopping aid for Kyiv and becoming less enthusiastic about Czech membership in Western institutions. While not in total alignment with Moscow's positions, Prague would become more vocal on the need to immediately stop the war and aim for peace -- most likely on the Kremlin's terms. Expect less harsh rhetoric toward China as well. Polling and political analyst Michael Ashcroft said in an analysis that the Czechs may join "what is from Kyiv's point of view a worrying trend in Central and Eastern Europe, with the existing stance of the Hungarian and Slovakian governments and the new Polish president much less inclined to defend Ukrainian sovereignty." "The consequences could include isolating Ukraine from Western European partners, disrupting military supplies and sowing further division in the alliance," he added. Just as it did in Moldova -- where elections last weekend saw a massive Russian disinformation campaign try and swing voters away from pro-Europe parties -- the Kremlin has been looking to take advantage of the waning support for aid to Ukraine that has helped fuel Babis's rise back to prominence. A Czech research group uncovered nearly 300 anonymous TikTok accounts aimed at amplifying pro-Russian narratives and backing radical parties in the final weeks of the election campaign. The Center For Research Into Online Risks said in a statement on September 28 that Czech TikTok accounts with millions of followers "are systematically spreading pro-Russian propaganda and support for anti-system parties through manipulated engagement." The center added that the accounts are not tied to a single political entity, instead "combining support for multiple anti-system parties simultaneously." "The cumulative reach of these accounts is 5 to 9 million views per week, more than the combined official accounts of the leaders of the largest Czech political parties on TikTok," it said. Analysts say the key thing to look out for now is which parties gain enough votes to enter parliament as Babis will likely need a coalition to govern. Spolu (Together), an alliance of center-right parties that includes the incumbent Prime Minister Petr Fiala's Civic Democrats is polling at around 20 percent, whereas the other parties of the current pro-Western coalition government Stan (Mayors and Independents) and the Pirates are predicted to end up with 10-12 percent each. All of these parties have said that they aren't interested in entering a coalition with ANO or even backing it with votes to pass legislation as a single-party minority government. But this is preelection talk and the tune could very well change after the vote, especially amid growing fears that more radical coalition alternatives could derail the Czech Republic's pro-Western course. As junior coalition partners, they could demand key posts in the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry. Secondly, there are factions in the current government, notably in the Civic Democrats, that share ANO's political positions -- committed to NATO but weaker on EU membership and opposed to euro adoption and Brussels policies such as mandatory refugee quotas and the green deal. But the Central European country could also change radically if Babis teams up with any of the current opposition parties that are even more radical than the ANO. These include the far-right SPD, polling above 10 percent, as well as a smaller far-right outfit AUTO (Motorists for themselves) and the far-left Stacilo (Enough), both of which are expected to clear the 5 percent threshold needed to gain seats in parliament. Governing with any of them would likely lead to a real rapprochement with Orban and Fico, both of whom have been critical of aid to Ukraine and are also in the vanguard of countries in Europe that continue to purchase Russian oil and natural gas despite Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A key figure in whatever comes after the election is pro-Western President Petr Pavel, who plays a role in government formation as well as foreign policy in general. Pavel, a former senior NATO general, has made it clear that he won't allow a government that strays too far from the Western course. Babis has been a constant fixture of Czech politics for the last 15 years, first serving as finance minister and deputy prime minister before leading the country from 2017 to 2021, as well as attempting to become president only to be trounced by Pavel in the 2023 election. One of the country's richest people, with considerable stakes in agribusiness and media, his time in the public spotlight has been dogged by legal disputes and accusations of conflicts of interest and EU subsidy fraud. Yet, it's also his business interests that many believe could keep him, and by extension the Czech Republic, anchored in the West as good relations between the Czech Republic and France, Germany, and Austria as well as the continued flow of EU agriculture and cohesion funds are more important than anything Beijing and Moscow can offer. Babis has chartered a more populist course in recent years and was one of the creators of the biggest populist forces on the continent, Patriots for Europe, a political family also consisting of Orban's Fidesz, Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, Spain's Vox, and Austria's Freedom party. He has also voiced support for Fico's Smer party even though they are not formally part of the Patriots for Europe alliance. Rallying against all things Brussels, environmentalism, and immigration, they would also find sympathetic ears beyond Central Europe with right-wing populists of various hues on the rise or in power in many other Western capitals as well.
