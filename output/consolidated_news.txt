Their investments may be dropping in value but many investors in Irish property funds are finding themselves stuck as restrictions on cashing in their investments remain in place. It’s a far cry from the heady days of the Celtic Tiger, when commercial property funds were the best-performing asset class – outperforming even Irish equities. While property funds struggled in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they turned it around but the environment has become challenging once more. After a buoyant 2015, when Irish Life’s fund returned almost 20 per cent, it has been in the red for four of the last five years. Similarly, both Zurich Life and New Ireland’s funds had negative returns in the year to January 6th, with Aviva’s fund the only one of the four in the black – with a return of just 0.2 per cent. Suzie Nolan, head of property with Aviva, says the life and pensions company’s property fund is facing “similar challenges evident in the wider Irish property market”. These include economic threats such as inflation as well as geopolitical uncertainty. The move towards working from home, and its consequent impact on demand for office space, as well as the ever-increasing requirement for landlords to provide more sustainable space have also had an impact. Funds started restricting withdrawals back in spring 2023, as a sharp change in direction on interest rates at the European Central Bank saw a surge in the number looking to withdraw their money. They feared increased funding costs could lead to project writedowns that could push down the valuation of such funds. It is not unusual for property funds to stop access to withdrawals, though that doesn’t mean investors are any happier to find themselves locked in at an inopportune time in the cycle. They typically carry warnings, like that of Zurich Life: “If you invest in this fund, there may be extended periods when you do not have any access to your money. “This means you could be waiting for a significant period of time before you are able to encash your investment,” Zurich Life says. And that is precisely the case at the moment. Irish Life has had a six-month waiting period on withdrawals since March 2023, while Zurich Life has now stopped investments both in – and out – of its fund. A spokesman says that “no inflows are permitted into the Zurich Property Fund, and a waiting period applies for withdrawals or switches out. The fund is reviewed on a regular basis and the restrictions for inflows and outflows may change in the future”. This means that the fund is shrinking, down from about €33 million in March 2023 to about €18 million as of August this year. Aviva introduced a moratorium of up to six months back in November 2023, due to “net outflows” from the fund and, according to a spokeswoman, this still applies. The holdings of the fund, which merged with the Friends First Irish Commercial Property fund back in May 2022, include: Blackrock Village Centre and Zurich House, both in Blackrock in south Dublin; the Globe retail park in Naas, Co Kildare; and 18 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin 2, which is currently available for letting. Typically, a fund will introduce a notice period to give fund managers time to make any property sales needed to pay future withdrawals. Often, funds will move to restrict withdrawals if cash reserves decline. Normally property funds keep a buffer of about 10 to 15 per cent of assets in cash to meet the demand for withdrawals. This time around, however, most of the funds are cash rich. New Ireland, for example, has 23.4 per cent in cash; Zurich Life has more than a quarter of its assets in cash, according to its most recent report; and Aviva has 12.2 per cent. New Ireland, which had a restriction, is one of the few funds with no restrictions. A spokesman says the New Ireland Property Fund is open to new investment, and there are no restrictions on withdrawals and switches. So should investors apply to withdraw their funds or wait it out? Well, the issue here can be that, depending on the fund, the request will be processed only at the end of the deferral period and at the unit price of the fund at that time – ie the unit price after the six-month deferral, not the unit price at the time the instruction was given. As a result, you are taking a gamble on where the price will go. You might also be faced with an early encashment penalty, so check the small print before making a decision. Many funds have also changed how they are being priced. New Ireland’s fund, for example, is priced on a disposal basis, “which ensures that policyholders exiting the fund pay their fair share of property acquisition costs” the spokesman says. This has been the case since 2020. This can happen when more money is going out of the fund than coming in, and is a strategy used to contain losses. At a time of growth, when a fund is expanding and purchasing assets, it will usually be priced on an acquisition basis. Moving to a disposal basis can be bad news for investors, especially in a market downturn; when New Ireland made the change it cut the unit price of the fund by as much as almost 8 per cent. Given an overall office vacancy rate in Dublin of about 16 per cent – up from about 5 per over the last five years – the city now has one of Europe’s highest rates. This is also reflected in the property funds. Irish Life’s vacancy rate is less than 10 per cent, while New Ireland’s is 9.7 per cent and Aviva’s is 8.4 per cent (which includes 3 per cent of strategic vacancy for redevelopment purposes). Funds also have run into difficulty when trying to offload properties. Irish Life acquired 1 Harbourmaster Place, KPMG’s current headquarters in the IFSC, back in 2015 for €50 million. It put it back on the market in 2020 for €54 million but it failed to sell. Now KPMG is set to move to Hibernia Reit’s development in Harcourt Square, and the lease on 1 Harbourmaster is due up in 2026. Despite the challenges however, fund managers remain upbeat about the future. State Street Global Advisors, which manages New Ireland’s fund, expects a bump in transactions as interest rates fall, which will lead to a “closer alignment of buy and sell side pricing expectations” – in other words more competitive prices. It also expects vacancy rates to fall in the office sector. “Despite offices generally being out of favour with investors in recent years, there are now signs that interest in the sector is turning” Aviva’s Nolan expects more stability in valuations this year, “with the possibility of some upward movements in certain subsectors, such as retail parks, as new rental evidence becomes available”. And she expects more economic opportunities to come through in 2025, such as the reducing cost of debt and a widening of the spread between bond rates and property yields, “both of which should be an impetus for further investment in the property sector”, she says. Aviva itself expects to be busy, with projects including the redevelopment of a site in Dundalk to deliver a primary care centre for the Health Service Executive expected to start this year, alongside other “value-add initiatives”, such as further letting activity and the rolling out of additional sustainability programmes.

Title: Bitcoin Recovers Above $100,000 After This Weekend’s Sharp Drop

Bitcoin prices climbed back above $100,000 today. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin bounced back on Monday, February 3, rising above $100,000 once again after falling to nearly $90,000 over the weekend. The world’s most valuable digital currency reached roughly $102,600 close to 5 p.m. EST, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency was up more than 10% from the recent low of close to $91,000 it attained on Sunday, February 2, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView show. When explaining the digital asset’s latest price movements, analysts cited several factors, including the recent tariff announcements, supply-demand dynamics and also the impact of speculative bets being liquidated. One market observer who weighed in on these developments is the the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. “Over the weekend President Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China,” she noted via email. “Since this was announced on 2/1/2025, Saturday, this caused a lot of fear for crypto traders on how this could impact traditional markets.” “Many, including Blackrock have indicated that Bitcoin is an ideal asset during volatile times of economic uncertainty, similar to Gold,” she emphasized. The analyst also emphasized sharp changes in leveraged positions, citing data provided by crypto analytics platform CoinGlass. “According to CoinGlass most traders took a long position and out of the historic $2.2B liquidations, ~$1.5B longs were liquidated while gold hit an all-time high,” Wendy noted. “This indicates Bitcoin traders, may have anticipated that Bitcoin would continue with bullish price action as uncertain economic conditions could have occurred Monday due to Trumps tariffs (similar to gold)." "However, the 25% tariffs placed on Mexican imports has been paused for the next 30 days which could indicate less volatility,” she stated, emphasizing today’s announcement that President Donald Trump was postponing tariffs on Mexico until early next month. Markets also found out today that Trump planned to pause the Canadian tariffs he announced over the weekend after speaking with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Certain analysts who offered input for this article made today’s increase in bitcoin prices seem predictable given existing market conditions. “Bitcoin’s recovery to $100K and above is no surprise—it’s simple supply and demand,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and everyday people are realizing fiat’s inevitable decline and moving into the best money ever invented,” he added. “Weak hands sold in the recent dip, but strong holders stepped in, stacking harder,” Klippsten stated. “Meanwhile, global uncertainty is driving more people to opt out of failing fiat. This is just the beginning.” Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also weighed in. “Today’s rebound was simply a recovery from the absurd drop yesterday,” he stated through email. “In most cases, the correlation with certain fiat markets works against Bitcoin; yesterday, had US equities markets been open, it would have worked very much in favor of BTC,” Enneking emphasized. “The drop on Sunday hit ridiculous proportions because there was nothing to slow it down and fear totally dominated greed; the drop only slowed once Asia markets had opened and had totally reversed several hours after US markets had done the same,” he stated. “So, billions of long positions wiped out and another data point created for folks who are considering investing in the crypto ecosystem,” Enneking concluded. Alex Lin, cofounder and general partner at venture capital firm Reforge, also weighed in, highlighting the strong interest of cryptocurrency buyers. “BTC’s rebound above $100,000 after its weekend lows points to a significant supply squeeze,” he wrote through emailed comments. “Over the past few days, retail investors capitulated due to fears sparked by Trump’s trade war headlines. However, large players and institutions took advantage of the dip to accumulate, as shown by the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, which indicated strong buyer demand with a noticeable premium,” Lin stated. “This activity underscores BTC’s resilience and suggests potential bullish momentum, especially as confidence in the broader market outlook remains strong,” he added.

February 03, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA) Class Period: February 7, 2024 - November 24, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that defendants provided investors with material information concerning Cassava’s leading drug candidate, simufilam. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam’s ability to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava’s stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Cassava class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SAVA MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Title: Searching For Yield in All of The Safe Places

What kind of investor are you? Do you want yield, safety, yield with a reasonable risk, or total return? I created a ranking system to combine Risk, Yield, Return, Quality, Trend, and Tax-Efficiency factors into an overall rating. I used yield divided by Ulcer Index which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns to limit the number of categories that I evaluate. My favorites may not be the same as yours. Table #1 shows how I rank the categories. I will be discussing each Lipper Category in the order of the “Overall” column. Approximately 10% of my bond investments are in six of the eight categories but the bulk of my bond investments are in bond ladders and core bonds along with diversification into global and international income categories. Table #1: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I extracted all mutual funds and exchanged traded funds using the MFO Premium Fund Screener and Lipper global dataset. What Table #2 tells us is that global high-yield and short high-yield categories don’t have as many funds or assets under management, and investors should invest with caution. Loan participation funds are interesting because they have a lower percentage of assets rated below investment grade, a small effective duration, and a high yield. High-yield categories have the highest 30d yields and the lowest-rated quality assets. Core plus bond funds have a longer duration and have performed poorly with rising rates. Table #2: Metrics for Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 is based on the history of nearly 400 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The top four categories have current yields of about 6% or more, full cycle returns of 4% to 7%, and drawdowns during severe market downturns of 13% to 20%. If investing in these categories go in with eyes wide open. By comparison, during the Dotcom Full Cycle from September 2000 to October 2007, the S&P 500 had an annualized return of around 2.0% The bottom four categories have lower yields and lower risk. Core plus bond funds performed relatively well during the financial crisis. I have invested in multi-sector funds as a middle-of-the-road option. Table #3: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I selected one fund, most interesting to me as a moderately conservative investor, from each of the eight Lipper Categories covered in the article. Table #4 is packed with useful information about risk (MFO Risk, MaxDD %, Bear Markets), risk-adjusted return (MFO Rating), returns (APR, Full Cycle), trends (Fund Flow, EMA), quality (Quality, Junk), and expenses (ER, FMR), and yield. Last month, I bought Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a lower-risk fund with a 30d yield of 6.0% and Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL) with a 30d yield of 7.2% but a little more risk. I bought Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) with a 30d yield of 5.2%. It has about 21% in equity and is higher risk and higher potential reward. The funds are loosely sorted with the safest to the left and riskier to the right in Table #4. For a future article, I have screened high-yielding funds rated with an MFO Risk of “Very Conservative” and Great Owl First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), and Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (AAA) are among the fourteen on the list. Table #4: Author’s Select High Performing Funds Per Lipper Category (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The steady profile and low volatility can be observed in Figure #2 below for First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA), and to a lesser extent Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL). As longer-term yields start to stabilize, I expect JPMorgan Income ETF (JPIE), Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX), and American Century Diversified Corporate Bond ETF (KORP) to start to perform better. Note that some of these funds have averaged a respectable return of 7% to 13% over the past two years. Figure #2: Author’s Select High Performing Funds Per Lipper Category Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Loan Participation Funds: Funds that invest primarily in participation interests in collateralized senior corporate loans that have floating or variable rates. Loan participation funds are a diverse group that can make returns of 5% to 8% during rising or falling rates. They can have positive returns during a mild recession, but some may lose 20% or much more during a severe financial crisis. Percent Junk Plus Not Rated is a fairly good indicator of performance during a severe downturn in bond prices as shown in Figure #3. For this reason, I bought more of Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) than I did of Franklin Senior Loan ETF (FLBL). Figure #3: 2022 Returns Versus Percent Junk Plus Not Rated Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Most of the loan participation funds that I selected for Table #5 have lower risk and volatility; however, BlackRock Floating Rate Income Portfolio (BFRAX) had a drawdown of 19.6% during the financial crisis compared to Fidelity Floating Rate High Income (FFRHX) which had a drawdown of 8.4%. Table #5: High Performing Loan Participations Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) is one of my favorites because of its low drawdown and volatility which can be observed in Figure #4. It invests in higher-quality assets. Figure #4: High Performing Loan Participations Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Short high-yield funds have a lower risk compared to most other categories in this article with decent returns compared to other short-term bond funds. I bought Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) because it has a lower percentage of “Junk” rated bonds and a lower drawdown. Of the ETFs, I favor Xtrackers Short Duration High Yield Bond ETF (SHYL). Table #6: High Performing Short High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I focus on performance over the last year or two because the Federal Reserve has stopped raising rates, but check how the fund performed during the latest downturn. While Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) has underperformed recently, it had a lower drawdown during the COVID recession. Figure #5: High Performing Short High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Global High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from both domestic and foreign fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. The global high-yield category does not have many quality funds, but I identify Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) and AB Short Duration High Yield ETF (SYFI) as high performers with respectable yields, but moderately large drawdowns. Table #7: High Performing Global High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Of the two funds, I favor Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) for its risk-adjusted performance. Figure #6: High Performing Global High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Of the ETFs, I like iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (SHYG) and expect it to perform better during falling rates or a market downturn with less volatility. I bought modest amounts of Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) and Fidelity High Income (SPHIX) for diversification within the high-yield category. Table #8: High Performing High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #7 shows the diverse range of performance of high-yield funds due in part to hedging, duration, percent junk, and owning equity. Figure #7: High Performing High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years. Columbia Threadneedle Investments wrote As Interest Rates Rise, Investors May Look To Floating-Rate Funds explaining that while floating-rate bonds do well when rates are stable or rising, they tend to underperform when rates are falling. I favor Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor ETF (FLDR) for its high yield and low volatility. Table #9: High Performing Short Investment Grade Debt Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #8: High Performing Short Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Multi-Sector Income: Funds that seek current income by allocating assets among several different fixed-income securities sectors (with no more than 65% in any one sector except for defensive purposes), including U.S. government and foreign governments, with a significant portion of assets in securities rated below investment-grade. Exchange-traded funds are relatively new to the Multi-Sector Income category and of the two, I prefer JP Morgan Income ETF (JPIE). I purchased modest amounts of both the Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond (VMSAX) and Fidelity Strategic Income (FADMX) for Traditional IRAs. Table #10: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #9: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of one to five years. I favor Great Owl First Trust Short Maturity ETF (FTSM) for its low volatility and drawdown. I own Fidelity Intermediate Bond (FTHRX) but traded a modest portion for other bond funds discussed in this article. Table #11: High Performing Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #10: High Performing Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Core Plus Bond Funds: Funds that invest at least 65% in domestic investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with any remaining investment in non-benchmark sectors such as high-yield, global, and emerging market debt. These funds maintain dollar-weighted average maturities of five to ten years. This is my least favorite category as its total return has been hampered as rates rose because of its longer duration, but I will continue to monitor it throughout the year.

Cryptocurrencies in the real-world asset (RWA) sector led the recovery of the broader digital asset market from the overnight bloodbath, underscoring the strength of the tokenization investment narrative. Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokenized asset platform Ondo Finance's governance token was 16% higher on the day, surging almost 40% from the overnight lows. The protocol today unveiled Ondo Nexus, an instant minting and redemption service for tokenized Treasury issuers. The company behind the protocol is holding a summit in New York later this week with several traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton participating. The native token of MANTRA (OM), layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized assets focusing on the Middle East market, rebounded 30% from Monday's bottom and was up 16% on the day. The network last month announced a billion-dollar asset tokenization partnership with Dubai property conglomerate DAMAC Group encompassing real estate and data center investments. The native token of Chintai (CHEX), a tokenization platform regulated and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, advanced 27% during the same period. The protocol laid out plans late January to enter the U.S. market and pursue securities licensing in the country. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) rebounded above $101,000 from the overnight lows and was 4% higher in a 24-hour period. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index consisting of large-cap tokens lagged with a 2% gain. Sophisticated investors often analyze the fastest horses recovering from capitulation lows to identify underlying strength in the broader market. RWA tokenization is a red-hot sector that aims to bring traditional financial assets like bonds, commodities and real estate on blockchain rails. with increasing participation from global banks and governments fueling the momentum. The RWA sector saw a 200% expansion to $7.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) last year, with government securities protocols leading the growth, crypto trading firm Wintermute noted. Recently, various influential leaders in the financial world touted tokenized RWAs as the next frontier of financial innovation with a potential to become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade. Larry Fink, CEO of asset management behemoth BlackRock, urged U.S. regulators and policymakers to create rules for tokenized securities, envisioning that bonds and stocks will be traded on blockchain rails in the future. He was joined by Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev last week, who proposed rule changes to unlock tokenized private equities to retail investors, currently limited to accredited investors and wealthy individuals.

Title: 'Opportunity for investors' as Trump's tariffs spark uncertainty for corporate Australia

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN The Business Topic:Company News Donald Trump's trade tariffs are a major source of uncertainty for markets. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) The next few weeks could end up being more exciting (or nerve-racking) than usual for people who've poured their money into the share market. Hundreds of Australian companies — from the Commonwealth Bank to Woolworths — will reveal how much money they have earned (or lost) over the past six to 12 months, as the biannual reporting season unfolds. There is no doubt company chief executives will be peppered with questions about what the future holds. But the problem is it might be hard for these highly paid bosses to provide much guidance, particularly with the unpredictability coming from the White House. Many had thought that Donald Trump's long-standing threats to introduce tariffs against America's biggest trading partners were a negotiation tactic. So the US President's decision to actually start a trade war with Canada, Mexico and China caught many by surprise — as evidenced by the hefty falls across global share markets, and the Australian dollar sinking to a five-year low. "I think in the short term, the implications are significant," said Gemma Dale, head of investor behaviour at NabTrade. Gemma Dale says there's a risk of tech stocks reporting disappointing results. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "The risk is that Trump is not as predictable as previous [US] administrations have been, so it's very difficult to make predictions about how the market is going perform for the rest of the year, given he's already shocked us multiple times in the past week or two." However, there are some fund managers who are feeling optimistic about the markets, despite the volatility that Mr Trump has unleashed with his tariff announcements. Tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump may not be a surprise, but they've certainly caused a shock on financial markets. Analysts say correction (a decline of of at least 10 per cent from the previous peak) on equity markets is now looking more likely. "At the moment, it's very hard to see the real long-term impact, and it's too early to even be thinking about the secondary impacts on inflation," said Jun Bei Liu, lead portfolio manager at Ten Cap. "That's because he [Trump] imposed this very quickly, and he's given himself time to change his mind. "I think this creates a lot of opportunity for investors, for some of the higher-quality companies if they get sold off." Although resource stocks are expected to come under pressure — due to their exposure to China's economy — Ms Liu believes the overall share market will keep rising for the rest of the year as interest rates start to fall in Australia. Jun Bei Liu expects the ASX to perform well this year despite the risks. (ABC News: John Gunn) At this stage, money markets are betting there is a 96 per cent chance of the Reserve Bank slashing interest rates at its 17-18 February meeting, followed by two more cuts by Christmas. And in a rare display of unanimity, economists from the "big four" banks (CBA, Westpac, NAB and ANZ) are predicting the RBA will announce that eagerly awaited rate reduction in two weeks. These coming weeks will be a good opportunity for investors to work out how well companies are performing — and whether they are paying too much for their shares. Despite Monday's tumble, the local share market is still trading near record highs. In general, if a company's results (and guidance about future profits) is better than expected, it leads to more people buying their stock — which drives up the share price. But if their results fall below what market analysts are expecting, it can lead to a sell-off for the company in more extreme cases. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some of the common jargon and has a calendar of all the key dates. "One of the key questions for investors will be, Is there going to be earnings growth for the Australian share market?'" said Julia Lee, head of client coverage at FTSE Russell. "And that's important because valuations are relatively high. "If we look at what happened in 2024, we actually saw earnings going backwards by about 4 per cent, and yet the Australian share market grew by 7.5 per cent. "That's not a sustainable trend when you're paying high multiples and high valuations." Ms Lee said shareholders wanted to see the companies they were invested in growing, which meant the lack of earnings growth was a problem. "This reporting season it will be all about whether we see upgrades to the outlook to help support those lofty valuations that we're seeing here on the Australian market." Julia Lee says gold miners may benefit from trade uncertainty. (The Business) Here is a table showing the price-to-earnings ratios of the ASX 200, and the various sectors which make up the share market (from most expensive to cheapest): At the upper end of the spectrum, people have been willing to pay high amounts of money (a share price 146.8 times the current earnings per share) for shares in local tech companies — as they have lofty expectations those businesses will develop new products and grow their profits rapidly in the future. On the flip side, a sharp fall in commodity prices last year have led to shares of BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside Energy and similar companies tumbling. Their profits are determined largely by how much their iron ore, oil, nickel and lithium can be sold for. So that is why the price-to-earnings ratios for the energy (11.2x) and materials (13.7x) sectors are lower compared to the broader market (19.9x). "There's a handful of companies in Australia where the price-to-earnings ratio is just extraordinarily high," Ms Dale said. Mexico and Canada have vowed to impose their own taxes on billions of dollars of trade with their closest neighbour. "You'd want to look very closely at the tech sector, in particular, where you've got companies like WiseTech Global and Xero on P/Es of more than 115 times. So those are very, very rich valuations. "They've grown very quickly and they continue to surprise to the upside generally. "But when you've got companies that are priced so well, and you're expecting that kind of dramatic growth quite a long way into the future, if there's any surprise — even if it's only marginally negative — or they don't live up to expectations, you can see a real, quite dramatic price response to that can be really disappointing." Australian banks are also looking quite expensive by this measure (with CBA commanding a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.8x). "Investors don't mind paying up as long as they get that [earnings] growth," Ms Lee said. "However, if we have a look at the banks' cash profits, they're forecast to contract 2 per cent [this year], which is a consensus view, and contract by another 1 per cent next year. "So the earnings outlook does look more difficult. And we know that people are doing it tough, paying off mortgages, so asset quality also comes into the picture as well." The three analysts and fund managers we spoke to revealed what they were watching in the February reporting season. Here are some of the trends they are looking out for: CBA is the world's most expensive bank, on its price to earnings ratio. (ABC News: Christopher Gillette) The biggest risk that most analysts are worried about is the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's policies — and the extent to which countries retaliate against US tariffs. With widespread tariffs (in a worst-case scenario), it could lead to the price of consumer goods becoming a lot more expensive across the globe, which could lead to inflation rising again (or not falling as quickly). That could lead to central banks (such as the RBA, US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank) announcing fewer rate cuts than had been expected. That would likely lead to the stock market, which was expecting rate cuts, to suffer heavy falls or even a correction — that is, a fall of at least 10 per cent from its most recent peak. "If inflation picks up again, and if we have interest rates moving higher, then it will challenge the investment thesis, making a lot of businesses and retailers struggle," Ms Liu said, adding the odds of that happening were low. "Consumers will falter and corporate earnings would struggle. "That is probably one of the biggest potential risks to the market." Disclaimer: This article is not intended as investment advice.

Title: Apple in 2024: The complete commentary

Time Published: 2025-02-03T20:07:01Z

February 3, 2025 12:07 PM PT Every year we ask a collection of writers, editors, developers, podcasters, and other people for their opinions about how Apple fared in the year just gone by. You can read our 2024 report card for the average scores and some juicy quotes. But if you want to read the whole thing—all 32,000 words of it—who are we to stand in your way? They wrote it, you read it. That’s how this works. Onward. How would you rate how the Mac platform went in 2024? Consider new Mac models, new chips, new macOS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Eric Linder: I have an M1 MacBook Pro, and the M4 looks delicious, but I’m going to wait one more year. I don’t have a vote per se, but I do like that Apple is updating the Mac lineup on a much more regular basis than in previous “times.” Benjamin Mayo: The M4 chip continues to show Apple’s silicon supremacy, posting impressive year-over-year gains. I was particularly glad to see the M4 Pro chip core configuration pivot away from last year’s weirdness and return to a beefy performance-tuned chip. The Mac mini got its long-deserved time in the sun with a nice update and chassis redesign, alongside decent spec bumps for the iMac and MacBook Pro. Also, a really welcome surprise was the bump to 16 GB RAM as the base spec for all models, including the ‘old but still sold’ M2 and M3 Airs. As far as macOS is concerned, I use iPhone Mirroring a lot and found it to be a stable and enjoyable affair. Roman Loyola: It sure feels like Apple took the criticism of the base M3 MacBook Pro to heart, and that’s why Apple made the changes it did, but I guess we’ll never know. Regardless, the upgrades were very satisfying. Glenn Fleishman: Apple keeps ticking over with new processors and models filling out and updating their matrix. Generally, they are delivering solid, often exceptional performance per dollar. In a year with both M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro updates and M4 and M4 Pro Mac minis in a new form factor, it’s hard to pick too many nits. But I think the iMac is way overdue for a 27-inch model, the Mac Studio lacked a refresh, and I have no idea what the company thinks the Mac Pro is for. I wish I could split Mac into two categories: how well are they keeping things going (such as finally removing the 8 GB low-end configuration), and how well they are introducing new features and form factors that are in demand (like the cuteness but also power and utility of the new Mac mini). I can’t give Apple a five on hardware for those reasons, but I also think macOS is at a point of confusion. The introduction of Apple Intelligence in waves and without having tentpole features that solve problems (across all platforms) is absolutely mystifying. I have new-enough Macs to take advantage of all AI features and I honestly find them mostly useful. Apple even replaced a perfectly good touch-up feature in Photos for macOS with an AI-based one that has worse performance and is in beta. This removed functionality people relied on. However, I’m a huge fan of a probably uncovered set of features I’ve written about in my books: screen mirroring and sharing. It’s dramatically better in every direction. Screen Sharing between Macs now works reliably for me; with iPhones and iPads, there’s a new and better approach; Mac to Apple TV offers more options and is far superior; Mac into videoconferencing, particularly FaceTime, much better; and the iPhone Mirroring app is a big bonus integration. Screen sharing/mirroring are boring areas that some people use intensively and others not at all; Apple’s improvements show that they can pay attention to the little things and provide integrated, upgraded, seamless OS features! Eric Slivka: The Mac mini redesign is a treat, while the overdue bump to 16GB of memory across the board was very welcome. Otherwise, nice to see the steady chip progression, though some will undoubtedly be disappointed at the higher-end machines skipping the M3 generation. macOS Sequoia has some nice improvements, though it has had a few hiccups along the way, and we’re still waiting on some of the promised features amid Apple’s gradual rollout. Brett Terpstra: The M4 lineup is top-notch. I’ve been using an M1 Studio for a while now, and moving up to the M4 was a bigger performance leap than I expected. I’m anxious to see the Studio lineup get upgraded, but the M4 Mac mini has an amazing bang/buck ratio, and the M4 MacBook Pro has me very satisfied with my purchase. Dave Hamilton: Great to see the MacBook Air get the M3 chip and continue to see love from Apple. I also love that the MacBook Air has become the default model for so many people, including professionals. Folks seem to have (finally?) accepted that it’s not only OK to live in a world of dongles, but it’s better because we each get to choose the ports that matter where they matter. Need one thing at your desk but different options when you travel? Great! You’ve got it. Also nice to see the “Pro” machines (iMac and MacBook Pro) get the M4 chip where it’s needed. I’ve (finally?) gotten over the fact that Apple won’t be making iMacs with screens large enough for me to use on a daily basis, but ViewSonic’s soon-to-be-released 27″ 5K Thunderbolt Display is an easy, $799 solution to that problem when paired with the new Mac mini, which is definitely the lede I’ve buried here. That thing is a beast and is the right computer for so many people who work on their Macs at their desks. What a fantastic upgrade! David Sparks: Apple Silicon Macs remain some of the best hardware Apple is shipping. I’m satisfied with the pace of improvement and the product line as a whole. If, however, I was someone at that top end of the performance curve, I’d be sad. I can’t help but feel there is an alternative universe where the Mac Pro has a chip that is so fast that it comes with a warning label—just not this one. Lex Friedman: I want every new Mac. Apple is crushing it with the Mac. I can’t believe how great every new Mac is. I feel like a fanboy when I write these words, but seriously, the state of the Mac today is exceptional. Craig Hockenberry: Here’s the thing: over the years, I’ve become less eager to upgrade my Macs to the latest version of macOS. I’m still using Sonoma on all my Macs and will only move to the new version when I’m forced to by a system requirement (that’s most likely to be Xcode). The main cause for lagging behind is all of the annoyances that come with each new version. I’m really tired of all the new security prompts, odd bugs from incomplete testing, and UI weirdness from designers and developers whose primary focus is iOS. It’s a shame the software is in this state because the Mac hardware has never been better. My MacBook Air is the best computer I have ever owned, and the whole product lineup is great (yes, even with the outrageous incremental costs for storage and memory). Marco Arment: It’s a great time to be a Mac user. The hardware is the best it has ever been, with nearly every need met with multiple great choices. macOS remains mostly good, due largely to neglect, but that’s better than today’s Apple touching it very much. Myke Hurley: The M4 was a really nice continued advancement of the power behind the Mac line. We got great laptop updates and a welcome simplification for the MacBook Air. However it would have been nice to get some clarity over the future of the Mac Studio. Matt Deatherage: The low end sees massive improvements, but the high desktop end seems more than ever like a status item for the one percent. Kirk McElhearn: A solid year for Macs, with M4 processors across much of the line and the attractive new Mac mini. This said, with the exception of the Mac mini, there’s no real innovation in new Macs; they’re all just upgrades of previous models. Maybe we don’t need anything different? But where is the Mac Pro, and what about a larger iMac? I don’t want one—I’m happy with the 24″—but I know many people who do. The lack of an upgrade to the Studio Display is a bit surprising, and Apple seems to have, once again, given up on caring about displays. The bump to 16 GB on all new Macs at no price increase underscores the fact that this extra memory is not worth $200, and is a reminder that we have been paying this Apple tax for years, since we can’t add RAM to Macs anymore. Stephen Hackett: As we round out the fourth year of the Apple Silicon Era, the Mac is truly firing on all cylinders. Modern Mac notebooks are incredible; even my new M4 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro runs silently and boasts shockingly good battery life. While I could have never had a notebook-only setup during the Intel days, I’ve done just that for several years with no complaints. The one ding on the hardware front is that the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are stuck on M2-based SoCs. It’s clear that the process used for the M3 was a bit of a dead-end and that an M3 Ultra wasn’t in the cards, but Apple’s two high-end desktops using old silicon is a bit embarrassing. On the software front, macOS Sequoia brought my favorite macOS feature in years, which was the iPhone Mirroring. I use it daily to access iPhone-only apps while sitting at my desk. I’m thrilled that Apple continues to find new ways to tighten the integration between the Mac and the iPhone without turning the former into the latter. Peter Cohen: I’d never have picked the M4 Mac mini to be the MVP, but it’s like the Genie from Aladdin: PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER! (Itty bitty living space.) Chance Miller: It’s pretty hard to complain about the Mac these days. The new Mac mini is another example of Apple flexing its design muscles in the Apple silicon era. The biggest change of the year, however, was Apple doubling the RAM in the base MacBook Air from 8GB to 16 GB. Bonus points for not raising the price and backdating the change to the M2 configuration as well. My only complaint semi-related to the Mac? We need new external display options. It’s time, Apple. Brent Simmons: The Current Mac UI design—both in terms of how it works and how it looks—could be improved. Nick Heer: The farther down you look on the Mac price list in 2024, the better the year was. The new Mac Mini is a tremendous value, as is the Walmart-exclusive M1 MacBook Air. Every Mac sold by Apple now has a (long-overdue) baseline of 16 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. As prices increase, though, the Mac is more of a mixed bag. The MacBook Air did not get Apple’s latest architecture despite updates to the Mac Mini and iMac, which share the same core parts. The MacBook Pro was updated, but the Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and Apple’s displays were not. MacOS Sequoia is fine. iPhone Screen Mirroring is useful, but Apple Intelligence is a mixed bag. Why is Writing Tools in an easy-to-accidentally-dismiss popover? Notifications are still buggy, and security prompts are out of control. Federico Viticci: Look, as we’ve established, I can now use my iPad Pro for everything I do and don’t need a Mac in my life. But I think Apple is doing an outstanding job with its Mac lineup, and I’m particularly envious of those who own the new Mac mini, which is small, powerful, and just exceedingly cute. I would give this category five stars; I don’t because Apple still insists on not making touchscreen Macs or more interesting and weird form factors. Shelly Brisbin: Apple’s Mac updates this year were solid but also satisfying. The ease with which M4 versions of the MacBook Pro and iMac entered the lineup says a lot about how well Apple’s hardware designs can carry forward for multiple years but leave room for the kind of performance improvements enthusiasts expect. The new Mac mini, though fans of the diminutive form factor impatiently anticipated it, was a big hit when it arrived, bringing plenty of power – and value – in a solid hardware package. More M4s are coming in 2025, surely. From a fan’s perspective, I enjoy the gradual, dare I say, thoughtful pace of updates. Rich Mogull: Between chip updates and the new Mac mini, Apple is firing on all cylinders. Michael Tsai: The M4 Macs have some virtualization, display, and USB issues, but overall the updates seem seem strong. I’m particularly excited about the MacBook Pro’s nanotexture display. The Mac input devices are finally USB-C, but they got the most minimal of updates, not fixing the Magic Mouse’s charging point or modernizing the globe key’s location on the extended keyboard. Unfortunately, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are still using M2 processors. SSD pricing is still ridiculous, and the software side is still a mess, both in terms of reliability and design. I have not found the Apple Intelligence features very useful. Probably the most exciting things for me in Sequoia are the new Passwords app and the new window management features, though in both cases I prefer third-party solutions. Dan Moren: Look, the Mac continues to have one of its best runs ever. Apple redesigned the Mac mini (the Mac mini!) for the first time in almost fifteen years, making it even smaller and putting ports on the front—a home run. If the Mac suffers from anything these days, it’s that the hardware seems so good that it’s hard to imagine how Apple can continue to improve it. Jeff Carlson: The Mac lineup seemed to find a groove and stick to it in 2024. Aside from the smaller size and greater power of the Mac mini, it’s felt like a transition to bigger, later things, especially at the high end. In fact, I’d say Apple has hobbled itself slightly with the M-series processors, particularly from a consumer point of view: the MacBook Pro has an M4, but the Mac Studio and Mac Pro still have an M2. Yes, there are Maxes and Ultras, and likely, the person buying those machines knows the differences, but it’s still not as solid of a pitch as Apple can do. All that said, the Mac remains solid. Casey Liss: There is nearly nothing to complain about with the Mac — when it comes to regular people, anyway. The new Mac mini is adorable, powerful, and affordable. The laptops remain incredible; the Air is great for most people and, for Apple, affordable. The MacBook Pro is overkill for many, but it remains a truly phenomenal machine. Several years into the Apple Silicon transition, I am still amazed I can have the modern equivalent of iMac Pro performance in a machine that I can easily carry with me, and use without being connected to power for hours. Arguably, the one indisputably great thing to come from Apple Intelligence is the VERY, VERY LONG, OVERDUE increase in RAM across the Mac lineup. Andy Ihnatko: The Mac lineup feels like an impressive, cohesive “collection” now (to dip back into my “Project Runway” super fandom days). I’m going to single out the Mac Mini for special love. The cheapest ticket to the Mac lineup is a perfect introduction to everything Apple does well. Howard Oakley: Generally a very good year, with some great highlights, and relatively few gaffes. James Thomson: The new Mac mini is delightful, though definitely not cheap at higher specs. More niche hardware like the Mac Studio still hasn’t seen any updates in a while. Adam Engst: The M4 Macs are brilliant. John Gruber: The Macs that Apple is shipping are better than ever. The most popular Mac models, by far, are the laptops, and both the MacBook Pro and Air lineups had good years, and now, even better, seem to be on regular annual upgrade schedules: MacBook Pros in the fall, MacBook Airs in the spring. I am especially pleased—borderline ecstatic—regarding the new nano-texture (matte) display option now available on MacBook Pros for $150. (They don’t even charge more for the option on the larger 16-inch models.) The only hitch in the lineup is the Macs Apple hasn’t been shipping: the Mac Studio and Mac Pro have remained unchanged since 2023, when the M2 models debuted. My presumption/hunch is they skipped the M3 generation for engineering reasons pertaining to TSMC’s first-generation 3nm process and will be back on track in 2025 with new M4-generation models around WWDC. MacOS 15 Sequoia, like 14 Sonoma and 13 Ventura before it, is a fine release. Reliable and familiar. Jessica Dennis: One wonders what Apple could have been doing instead of spending person-hours building a bunch of AI stuff that doesn’t seem particularly good or useful into MacOS. Mac hardware quality continues to be excellent, and lucky for me, I fall into one of the well-supported niches (i.e., I buy a new laptop every five years or so, and it’s fine). However, I’ve definitely seen the genuine angst some folks have about product upgrade cycles. Michael Gartenberg: The Mac has been pretty stable, and that’s not a bad thing; the M series of processors has delivered well for users. Unfortunately, for many users, there’s no reason to upgrade from their M1 or M2 to jump on the latest devices. The new Mac mini is a great device but creates confusion in the line relative to devices like the Studio devices, making it challenging for high-end users to figure out what devices are for them. Apple also finally acknowledges that perhaps 8 GB of RAM isn’t enough for users, which is good because Apple’s prices for both RAM and storage upgrades are absurd. Apple either needs to find a new supplier for memory and storage, make these things upgradeable, or stop gouging customers. Carolina Milanesi: Apple Silicon continued to be the purchase driver for the Mac. Market share in Enterprise is growing, offering Apple a new opportunity to penetrate a space that has mostly been BYOD in the past. The broad range of price points and computing power offers Apple the ability to have a low entry point and go all the way to a workstation competitor. Christina Warren: Man. What a great year for the Mac. Four years on, Apple silicon continues to impress. The much-touted Apple Intelligence might be a bust, but it forced Apple to finally give every Mac 16GB of RAM. RAM and storage upgrade pricing continue to be war crimes — but at least every Mac has 16GB of RAM now. The base model M4 Mac mini is one of the most compelling and best-value Apple products we’ve seen, probably since the venerable M1 MacBook Air. I wish it had more storage, but it shows that Apple can actually offer a compelling product priced under the competition for its performance. The MacBook Air would’ve been a push update for me but then Apple had to up the RAM even in the M2 models for the Apple Intelligence launch. I got a great deal on a 13″ M3 with 16GB of RAM for my mom that wipes the floor with anything priced that way in Windows Land — x86 or Qualcomm. The M4 chips look like real winners. I won’t be replacing my maxed-out 2023 14″ M3 Max, but I hope we get a Mac Studio this spring so I can harness some of that power. The Studio and the Mac Pro are the unloved children. But that’s fine. As a desktop devotee, even I’ve accepted that Apple is a notebook company that occasionally makes desktops and, about once a decade, releases a mini PC so compelling that it’ll act as my home server for the next decade. macOS is not as good as it used to be. I hate the new UAC stuff for screen capture, and the settings menu is the worst. But compared to our friends in Windows land (to say nothing of our Linux compatriots, steam notwithstanding) dealing with Recall drama, it’s a good time to be a Mac user. And as Simon Willison noted, Apple Intelligence might be hot garbage (OK, I editorialized the hot garbage bit), but MLX is great. And despite Nvidia being a behemoth, Apple machines are great for doing local AI development. It was just an unbelievable year for the Mac. Andrew Laurence: The M4 generation looks to be one of leveling up across the product line. More like this, please. Zac Hall: Good riddance, 8GB RAM. You simply don’t have enough memory to be missed. Matt Birchler: It might be too bold, but I wonder if the Mac lineup is as good as it’s ever been in Apple’s history. Name a bad computer in the lineup; I don’t think you can. Exciting new form factors would be great to see, and macOS could always improve, but if we don’t call the Mac great right now, then I don’t know when it will be great. Shahid Kamal Ahmad: The M4 line of chips feels like the first justifiable upgrade opportunity for those who jumped in with the M1. Where the M2 and M3 were decent but still just incremental upgrades, the M4 is a powerhouse. I’m disappointed that the black MacBook Pro is not a true black, but that’s truly petty given that there still doesn’t seem to be any other computer that comes close to offering the Mac’s astonishing quality, performance, and power, not to mention that it still beats everything else for style and convenience. The dark days of the Mac seem to be a fading memory now. Long may this continue. Allison Sheridan: Who would have thought the Mac mini would lead the excitement for 2024 with the M4 Pro? The other across-the-board advancement was making all entry-level Macs come with 16GB/256GG, which was a win all around. Brian Mattucci: While the migration to M4 is going as expected, and the Mac Mini redesign is a positive, the long wait for the Mac Studio with the latest Apple silicon continues to feel illogical when the model they’re selling is now two generations behind and will likely be nearly three generations behind by the time they finally update it. Quinn Nelson: The M4 took everyone by surprise. From its unexpected debut on the iPad to delivering process gains far beyond expectations, it was hands-down Apple’s star of 2024. And the new Mac mini? Seriously—how could you not love it? Adorable! Paul Kafasis: Mac hardware is really looking good, with frequent updates. MacOS updates have been good, though there’s a lot of churn going on, and features coming in 15.1, 15.2, and beyond, is somewhat bothersome. Can Apple get off of the annual OS update cycle yet? John Siracusa: The M4 chip series is the best since the M1. The single-core performance and power efficiency are both great, which is important for the low-core-count M-series chips that most people buy. The uncertainty surrounding the “big” desktop Macs and the chips that will power them continues to be a problem, however. I was happy to see the base RAM in Macs increase to 16 GB this year. Call it the Apple Intelligence Dividend. Ironically, this is also the year that Apple’s absurdly high pricing for RAM and storage upgrades—which definitely continued in 2024—has gotten a bit more widespread attention. I’m not sure if it will change anything, but something has to give. Consider the new M4 Mac mini. It’s impossible to build a PC that is as powerful as the base M4 mini for the same amount of money. But as soon as you add any kind of upgrade from the base specs, the M4 mini completely loses its value lead—often by a lot. I’ve calculated that Apple’s storage upgrades are now 6.5x higher than retail market prices for the same size and performance. Ridiculous. Philip Michaels: The move to Apple silicon continues to pay dividends. It’s probably the smartest thing Apple’s done in years. Steven Aquino: I feel like the Mac is firing on all cylinders right now, thanks in large part to Apple silicon. While my daily driver machine is a 2019 Retina 4K iMac on Intel—I do have an M2 MacBook Air as well—the value proposition is off the charts, seeing it still going strong nearly 6 years after I bought it. How would you rate how the iPhone and iOS platform went in 2024? Consider new hardware, new chips, OS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Paul Kafasis: The iPhone seems strong, and iOS 18 had some good updates. Interestingly, though, this is the first year since 2008 that I didn’t get a new iPhone. The hardware update just wasn’t that compelling to me, in part because my iPhone 15 Pro is Apple Intelligence compatible. David Sparks: The iPhone is what it needs to be: a solid platform that sells billions of units per year. However, I wish Apple had continued the mini for folks who prefer something smaller. I’d also like to see them take a few more risks with a non-flagship model, which may be the aim of the rumored iPhone Air. But if the rumors are true, it doesn’t sound like a big enough risk to me. Casey Liss: I could have made a case for a five, but for this year, I think four is more appropriate. While I mostly like the Camera Control, I think it’s too fiddly by half. A few months in, I suspect I would have preferred a dumb shutter button to the fancy touch-sensitive setup that we actually got. I am overjoyed to return to a human-sized phone from the 15 Pro Max I had last year, but even the regular-sized phones are large enough that I didn’t give up my PopSocket—#mykewasright. I’m also getting sick and tired of the Pro phones having absurdly boring colors. Apple, it won’t take away from the other Pro models to have fun colors. Offer the boring ones of today, as well as some fun ones… PLEASE! The non-Pro colors are SO GOOD this year; I’d probably pay a bit more to have that blue in a Pro phone. Marco Arment: iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 family are almost universally great. My only (minor) complaint is the Camera Control button, an overthought, finicky, error-prone engineering indulgence that actually can be pretty useful, but only once most of its functionality is turned off. Benjamin Mayo: Apple delivered about as much as you can reasonably expect for an ‘iteration’ year of the iPhone. The base models represent really good value this year, with only a couple of minor details separating them from the Pro lines. I think the Camera Control was a bit of a miss; it’s fine as a shutter button, but all of the gestural stuff feels like a gimmick, given its current implementation. The sheer number of settings to change its behavior is laughable and perhaps speaks to a need for Apple to give it a second look and strip it back to what is really most useful. Apple Intelligence may still be rolling out in a piecemeal fashion, but I find features like the email summaries and improved photo search to meaningfully improve the iOS experience. Jessica Dennis: The iPhone continues to be solidly Good, if unexciting. Apple may have been shocked that no one was particularly interested in upgrading their phone just for the new Apple Intelligence features, but very few other people were (myself included). I get a new phone annually because of the Apple Upgrade program, and that’s the only reason. For the past couple of years, I haven’t had a use case for a Pro model. And I miss the iPhone Mini so much. Dave Hamilton: I was stoked that Apple Intelligence essentially forced Apple to make the base model iPhone 16 almost as powerful as the iPhone 16 Pro. This truly gives people options and, of course, allows everyone getting a new iPhone this year to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. Adam Engst: Having the Action button and Camera Control on all iPhone 16 models is great, but otherwise, the iPhone 16 lineup doesn’t seem to be much of an improvement over previous models. And while I know it’s boring to complain about the lack of a smaller iPhone, I also field non-stop complaints from people who want one and aren’t upgrading from the iPhone SE because of that. Rich Mogull: The iPhone 16 and 16 Pro are solid updates, and the non-Pro has really stepped up the value proposition. I’m mixed on the new Camera Control; even though I use it a lot for zoom, I still don’t have a good handle on making it work like I want. The response is just a bit off. iOS 18 is a good start, but Apple Intelligence isn’t quite there yet. Maybe in 18.4. John Gruber: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Nothing has been broke regarding the iPhone lineup, and Apple hasn’t tried to fix anything. This is good. Changes for the sake of change are the surest sign of a company in decline. Stagnation and hubris are concerns for any wildly successful product, but it takes confidence to let great design speak for itself without making facile, unnecessary changes. Camera Control is the big new hardware change in the iPhone 16 generation, and while I’d like to see the actual button improve (I think it’s too hard to press), in practice I make frequent use of it. I spent some time back on an iPhone 15 over the holidays, and I instantly missed having a Camera Control button to launch the Camera app. Kudos to Apple for bringing Camera Control to the entire iPhone 16 lineup, not just the Pro models. iOS 18 is refined, mature, and familiar. Joe Rosensteel: The hardware is the best iPhone hardware they’ve ever shipped. The software promises Apple is making around Apple Intelligence aren’t compelling, and Apple didn’t deliver on them in 2024. Camera Control is a mess, but it doesn’t impair phone usage. People should really take a step back and think through the headline features because they were anything but. The new, editable Photographic Styles have had a bigger impact on my life than any other 2024 feature. Michael Gartenberg: Someone at Apple forgot that it’s _under_promise and _over_deliver, not the other way around. iPhone 16 was sold on the basis of Apple Intelligence, which wasn’t present at the launch, it took two releases to bring some of the promised features, and when they failed, Apple removed them as opposed to fixing them. Siri remains far behind Google and Samsung in terms of AI features that actually do something. The good news is iPhone 15 users don’t feel nearly as bad for not getting Apple AI on their devices, and they can use things like Gemini or Copilot for their AI fix. I do give them credit, as they promised a glow effect and delivered on that rather nicely. I am not a fan of the camera button. It feels like it’s in the wrong place, and it’s kind of hard for me to use; the volume button works fine for me. I was kind of baffled when Tim said that email summaries were a game changer for him, making me wonder if he gets very little email or uses some other AI for his email summaries. Matt Birchler: The iPhone is still the best phone for me, but 2024 definitely felt like an off year to me. I think the iPhone 16 is a good update, but the 16 Pro line is a real miss in my book. I’d actually pay more to get a 16 Pro that didn’t have the Camera Control button because it’s turned into a button that I exclusively use on accident and never on purpose. I still use the Action Button to launch and use my camera because it feels better to me. Also, Apple Intelligence really put a stink on this whole year for the iPhone, as seemingly very few other software features were added, and the few Apple Intelligence features we’ve gotten have arrived later than hoped for and have been almost universally underwhelming. Andy Ihnatko: The iPhone 16 is the same old dish, prepared with fresh ingredients. That’s all that Apple was prepared to release this year. It’s fine: a solid 3/5. I have to deduct a full point for Apple Intelligence. Most of these features are as squirrelly as everybody should have expected: no more, no less. I expect Apple Intelligence to improve after this first round of users provides a galaxy of training data. But Apple chose to roll these features into the mainstream iPhone OS and promote them as if they were finished features, so I have to factor that in. Carolina Milanesi: Solid hardware, but Apple Intelligence was a bit of a letdown. Brian Mattucci: 2024 was all about the slow trickle of Apple Intelligence features of uncertain value. Some features (Image Playground and especially Genmoji) were interesting at first, but they feel like they’re years away from being reliable and useful. I was a big fan of notification summaries at first, but I’ve seen enough errors at this point to no longer trust them. I turned off the mail categorization feature almost immediately. I love the Home Screen and Control Center customization options – they’re the highlights of iOS 18 for me. As for hardware, adding the camera control button makes some sense, though I don’t use any of the features beyond launching the Camera app – it just doesn’t feel precise enough. Eric Linder: The iPhone is a fully mature product at this point, and sometimes, I struggle to think of new features that might be implemented. One criticism I have is that Apple seems to continue to sell the iPhone 16 line based on the promises of future features (I’m looking at you, not-so-intelligent-Apple-Intelligence). Even when the iPhone 16 was launched, commercials seemed to appear everywhere that used Siri app intents and context awareness, both of which are STILL not available even to iOS 18.3 beta users. Roman Loyola: I usually upgrade to a Pro Max, but this time, I opted for the 16 Plus, and I’m happy with it. Until I start making “cinema,” I may not get a Pro phone again. Steven Aquino: The iPhone impresses every year in my eyes. I upgrade it every year not merely for journalism’s sake but because it’s my most important and oft-used computer. Jeff Carlson: I want to give this a 3.5 because overall, the iPhone is in good shape; the 16 series is good, but despite the technological complexity and ingenuity of the Camera Control on the 16 Pro, in practice, it just doesn’t work as well as it should. It’s too finicky and, most important, often doesn’t do what you expect it to do. Dr. Drang: The Camera Control is possibly the worst Apple UI device since the hockey puck mouse. There’s a reason no real camera manufacturer recesses their shutter button. Depressing a recessed button is a recipe for both shaking (as you’ve complained about) and tilting. Worse is how the photographic styles shift for seemingly no reason. I know I must be sliding my finger on the button, but I’m trying not to. It’s too sensitive and keeps making changes I don’t want. I should say “kept” instead of “keeps.” I’ve changed the Camera Control to open Magnifier, and I now use the Acton button to open the Camera. It’s much less frustrating. Dan Moren: The iPhone is great and continues to be great. But this year’s focus on Apple Intelligence is disappointing and sucked a lot of the air out of the room when it came to actual feature improvements that people want. I still use Camera Control, but I think a lot of its extra features, beyond opening/taking pictures and video, are clunky and not useful. It feels a bit like the company is struggling to find opportunities to improve what has become an increasingly mature product category. Eric Slivka: The iterative updates continue as we wait for some bolder changes from Apple. I love the colors on this year’s standard iPhones but I continue to hope for some better options on the Pro side. I’ve struggled and failed to embrace Camera Control, and even in the second year for Pro users, I’ve not found a lot of value in the Action button. On the software side, Apple Intelligence is obviously the big thing, but we’re only barely dipping our toes into it so far. The verdict is yet to come, but so far, it’s been underwhelming. Craig Hockenberry: Apple Intelligence is underwhelming, especially with Siri. It also feels like a lot of engineering resources were directed toward features that no one asked for and can’t really trust. But again, the hardware is stellar. And the “intelligence” does have an upside: more memory in our pockets. Kirk McElhearn: It’s all about Apple Intelligence this year, and limiting these features to only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models feels like an attempt to force a super cycle, which doesn’t seem to be occurring. I upgraded from an iPhone 14 Pro, and honestly feel that I could have kept my 14 a year longer. I’ve heard from plenty of non-tech people that they simply don’t care about Apple Intelligence, and they see no need to upgrade phones that work just fine. Shelly Brisbin: Like the Mac, the iPhone platform moved ahead incrementally in 2024 if evaluated year-over-year. But the base on which this year’s updates stand is solid enough to offer tempting upgrades to almost anyone who has kept their phone for more than a year. I feel good about the division of features between Pro and non-Pro phones. If an advanced camera system is irresistible, you can have it. But bringing hardware features like the Action Button and Dynamic Island to the full line of new phones is friendly to all kinds of users. The most disappointing aspect of this year’s phones is Camera Control, which attempts to pack a lot of punch into one hardware button but remains confusing to use. iOS is frankly weighed down by the simultaneously glacial pace, and forcible implementation, of Apple Intelligence. From a business perspective, Apple had to build AI into its platforms this year, and the iPhone is where that’s unavoidably apparent. But there have been bugs and poorly implemented offerings, and despite the emphasis on Apple Intelligence in the ads, it’s unclear to me why a buyer would choose Apple’s version of AI over another. I like the tabby cat playing the guitar that I sent to my friend yesterday, but even he isn’t a killer iPhone app. Chance Miller: I tried really hard to use the Camera Control to its full potential with all the various swipe and half-press features. The reality is it’s most useful as a way to launch the Camera app and take a picture. Nothing more. Otherwise, the iPhone 16 Pro models are a stellar upgrade. The battery life continues to impress me on a daily basis. The non-Pro phones are more enticing than they’ve ever been. Oh, and RIP FineWoven. I wish Apple had replaced it with something better, but at least it’s dead. Federico Viticci: It’s been an interesting year in iPhone land for me. After the September event, I purchased an iPhone 16 Pro Max, but my mind kept going to the iPhone 16 Plus. I was fascinated by its color, slimmer form factor, and more affordable overall package. I used the iPhone 16 Plus as my primary phone for two months and loved it, but then something happened: much to my surprise, I realized that I wasn’t taking as many pictures of my dogs, friends, and family as I used to with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. That’s when it hit me. I thought I wouldn’t need all the features of a “pro” phone – and, honestly, since I’m not a professional cinematographer, I really don’t – but in the end, I was missing the 5x camera too much. In my experience with using a 16 Plus, I was able to confirm that, if I wanted, I could live without a ProMotion display. But it was the lack of a third, zoomed camera on the Plus model that ultimately got me. I rely on the 5x lens to take dozens of pictures of my dogs doing something funny or sleeping in a cute way every day, and its absence on the 16 Plus was preventing me from grabbing my phone out of my pocket to save new memories on a daily basis. I’m glad I did this experiment because it also left me with a couple of additional thoughts about the iPhone line. First, if Apple comes out with a completely redesigned, slimmer “iPhone 17 Air” later this year that doesn’t have a 5x camera, I’ll have to begrudgingly pass on it and stick with the 17 Pro Max instead. Second, now more than ever, I truly, fundamentally want Apple to make a foldable phone that expands into a mini-tablet when opened. I don’t care how expensive Apple makes this device. I look at the latest Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and I’m very jealous of its form factor, but I also know that I wouldn’t be able to use Android as the OS for my phone. If it weren’t for the lack of a foldable form factor in Apple’s iPhone lineup, I would give this category five stars. I hope we’ll see some changes on this front within the next couple of years. Michael Tsai: This is one of those years where the new iPhones seem fine, but I feel no urgency to upgrade from the previous model. The most interesting things to me are Photographic Styles and Camera Control. I’m hoping that the former will eventually let me reduce over-processing . The latter sounded promising but now seems more like the new Touch Bar: over-engineered and less useful than the basic Action button. iOS 18 adds a bunch of useful features. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues. James Thomson: Incremental updates, but still interesting. Stephen Hackett: By tightly bundling the iPhone, iOS, and the App Store, Apple has made it impossible to untangle the iPhone from Apple’s ongoing legal woes in the European Union and beyond. And by plastering the planet with rainbow-colored Apple Intelligence ads, Apple has wound the iPhone up very tightly with a group of features that weren’t even shipped when the iPhones launched last fall. That puts Apple’s most valued product in a slightly weird spot, but the Report Card demands answers, so let’s start with hardware. The iPhone 16 cycle brought Camera Control, an excellent bit of hardware engineering swamped with confusing software decisions. Learning to swipe, press, and click around the tiny UI can be confusing. With visual intelligence a press-and-hold away, it’s easy to be in the wrong mode entirely if you activate the button as you pull your iPhone out of your pocket. Apple has made it possible to simplify the Camera Control, boiling it down to a basic shutter button, but this requires delving into multiple sections across Settings. The Action button was added to the regular iPhone 16 models in 2024, and the 5x telephoto lens from the 15 Pro Max lives on in both the 16 Pro Max and the 16 Pro. Both are great changes, as is the move to a bolder color palette for the 16. However, 2024 was also the Year of Apple Intelligence. These loosely associated features run across various iPads and all Apple silicon Macs. However, Apple is marketing these features as a core component of its newest iPhones. That’s unfortunate, given how mediocre much of Apple Intelligence has proven to be so far. Apple’s writing tools are good, but nothing exceptional, and the UI is quite cramped on the iPhone. When it comes to image generation, Apple Intelligence shines with Genmoji, which is a genuinely fun feature, but it also falls on its face with Image Playgrounds. The images it creates are far behind the competition, and honestly, a race I wish Apple weren’t running. The company says it has gone to great lengths to build guard rails to keep Image Playgrounds from creating anything offensive or troubling, but it’s not hard to get it to create fictional images depicting some of history’s worst people. At least they look like cartoon characters, which is the best product choice Apple made here. The lack of photorealism may keep Image Playgrounds out of the headlines for making fake news, but Apple’s summarization of notifications has done just the opposite. From screwing up sports scores to re-writing breaking news alerts to say the opposite of the reporting, notifications summaries don’t seem ready for prime time. Apple hasn’t yet shipped the next generation of Siri either, which raises questions about Apple feeling rushed to get these features into the market. If it’s true, it’s an unusual place for Apple to be in, and I hope the company will not make the same mistake again. Zac Hall: Desert titanium and a dedicated camera button are nice. Nick Heer: While the flagship Pro model always makes the most noise among the kind of people who read pundits’ report cards about a tech company, the iPhone 16 should not be overlooked. Neither should iOS 18, which, even without considering Apple Intelligence, has solid updates to core apps I use every day and is more customizable. However, iOS remains buggier than I would like. I find interacting with the Dynamic Island and always-on display needlessly difficult, and Apple Intelligence is not very good yet. Andrew Laurence: This iPhone SE user looks forward to the next iteration of the iPhone’s value entry. Rosemary Orchard: I love the new camera button, but I feel it needs more automation possibilities Shahid Kamal Ahmad: Apple’s AI functionality feels like a rushed misstep. Most of us just don’t need what it offers, and the contortions to ring-fence access to OpenAI’s back end feel like the kind of thing Apple did when it apologetically added iTunes to a Motorola handset. Meanwhile, the hardware continues to be elegant, assuming what seems to be the definitive peak form factor for such a device. Incredibly, the 16 Pro Max feels less of a tank than previous models while still offering best-in-class performance and camera quality. After my iPhone mini 13, I didn’t think I’d upgrade. Now that I have, I don’t regret my purchase for a minute. This phone has all the performance required to deliver a class-leading UI responsiveness, and apart from the AI farce, a rollout that surely must be embarrassing for the executive team, it’s a device that does everything I need from a smartphone without ever breaking a sweat. It looks, feels and behaves like a premium product, but one where the UI could likely do with an overhaul to manage all the underlying complexity and features a little better. This complexity manifests in the form of additional buttons. It’s unusual for Apple to move so far away from the austerity of the Ive era, but perhaps with the addition of the camera button, they’ve made the UI more confusing than it needs to be. I keep forgetting that the button is there, and I sometimes activate it by accident, but can never seem to remember to use it when the need arises. This is to be expected, given that I’ve become so accustomed to the UI that’s been working well for so long. Philip Michaels: Phones are becoming commodities, and whatever will freshen up the platform AI in general and Apple Intelligence ain’t it right now Christina Warren: This is weird because, on the one hand, this is easily the most underwhelming iPhone Pro update I can recall in years and years. But the base model iPhone and iPhone Plus got some real juice. Apple Intelligence is still vaporware and nearly useless except for the ChatGPT integration, in my opinion, but I’m glad it forced Apple to up the RAM in the non-pro phones. But even though I genuinely have noticed nothing new on my iPhone 16 Pro Max compared to the 15 Pro Max, I think the base iPhone/iPhone Plus upgrades are really strong. It is too bad so many of the “features” of the phones are tied to software that might not land until mid 2025. Alex Cox: ust when the regular iPhone gets good enough for what most power users would want in a phone, the iPhone Pro is really pulling away from the smartphone pack in terms of actual professional use. Final Cut Camera with multi-camera support came out of left field and landed pleasantly into independent filmmakers’ laps. That said, when one needs to use multiple iPhones on multiple Apple IDs and then allow them to connect to another device running Final Cut Pro, it feels like Apple is trying to take it out of our laps. There needs to be a better way to manage and administer multiple phones as cameras when you’re a three-person company not brimming with enterprise-managed devices. Allison Sheridan: I’m going 5 again primarily because of the iPhone 16. They brought so many of the top-of-the-line features to the non-Pro phone, allowing people to make very few compromises to get a fantastic phone. Bringing 5X to the 16 Pro gave it feature parity with the Max, so there are no compromises between the two. Glenn Fleishman: Nothing stands out for me on the hardware side. As noted for macOS, I don’t find that AI serves a need. Siri on the iPhone seems marginally better. I use it a lot and feel like it can do more within iOS, but I still get weird transcription errors that seem like they should be overcome, and it fails to be able to do a lot. It often says, “You need to unlock your phone,” when my iPhone is unlocked already…and then Siri completes the task anyway. Peter Cohen: The 16 may be “built for Apple Intelligence,” but so what? Rob Griffiths: So far, at least, Apple AI has been a massive disappointment. I’ve found so little benefit from it that I’ve disabled it. In my work, at least, there’s absolutely no benefit to having it enabled. John Siracusa: My new iPhone 16 Pro has followed in the footsteps of its recent predecessors by being a bit better than the iPhone it replaced without adding any major regressions. My one frustration is the Camera Control. The button itself is fine, but most third-party case makers accommodated it by cutting a huge hole in the side of their cases, which I find awkward and uncomfortable. Only Apple and a handful of third-party case makers have included a pass-through button for the Camera Control, and none of those cases are to my liking. I hope more case makers offer pass-through buttons in 2025. Myke Hurley: I think if I were grading without my personal feelings, I would knock this down a bit. But switching from the Pro Max to the Pro this year has been a really lovely change. The new increased size of this phone has made it the perfect sweet spot for me. I am a fan of the Camera Control button, but I think the execution leaves a little to be desired. I think the swiping is too complicated, and the force needed to take photos is too strong. I look forward to this changing over time. I think that there was a lot more conversation in the broader community this year about the regular phone over the pro phone. This would indicate that Apple kinda missed the mark on the overall product mix. Quinn Nelson: On the one hand, we have the best update to the standard iPhone in years. On the other, we’re stuck with one of the buggiest, most feature-deprived versions of iOS in recent memory. How would you rate how the iPad and iPadOS platform went in 2024? Consider new hardware, new chips, OS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Brian Mattucci: I love my M4 iPad Pro. The screen is beautiful, the thinner design makes it easier to hold, and it feels like a really refined device. As with iOS, the Home Screen and Control Center customization options are wonderful. While there are plenty of ambitious changes I would love to see on iPadOS, the product they’ve delivered is still one that I find essential. Matt Birchler: After the no-new-hardware year that was 2023, it was refreshing to get updates to almost all iPads in 2024. The new Pros are amazing devices that even got the privilege of introducing the M4 generation of chips; the Air got a boring but fine update, and the Mini got maybe the most subtle update of all. Sadly, software was on the back burner this year as the iPad got almost no new features outside of Apple Intelligence and a couple of minor things iOS also got. Craig Hockenberry: I still want to run macOS on an iPad. It’s so weird that I take a MacBook on trips when an iPad would be a better choice. Carolina Milanesi: iPad Pro was a solid upgrade, but some of the issues about software being able to elevate the device to a Mac level remain. Kirk McElhearn: This year, I upgraded from an M1 iPad Pro to the M4 model, which is a very nice if overpriced iPad. The M2 iPad Airs also look fine, and these two iPads offer Apple Intelligence features for those who care. The iPad mini upgrade seems a bit underwhelming, but Apple has never shown much love to that model. Federico Viticci: What can I say about the iPad that I haven’t already documented extensively? I love the iPad Pro’s hardware, and I find the M4 iPad Pro a miracle of hardware engineering with no equal in other similar products. In 2024, I chose to go all-in on the 11″ iPad Pro as my only computer; in fact, since the MacPad stopped working a few weeks ago (RIP), I don’t even have a Mac anymore, but I can do everything I need to do on an iPad – that is, after a series of compromises that, unfortunately, continue to be the other side of the coin of the iPad experience. Going into its 15th year (!), the iPad continues to be incredible hardware let down by a lackluster operating system that is neither as intuitive as iOS nor as advanced or flexible as macOS. The iPad is still stuck in the middle, which is exactly what I – and my fellow iPad users – have been saying for years now. I shouldn’t have to come up with expensive hardware-based workarounds to overcome the limitations of a platform that doesn’t want me to use my computer to its full extent. But, despite everything, I persist because no other tablet even comes close to the performance, thinness, and modularity of an iPad Pro. Dave Hamilton: I’m an iPad mini user (and fan!) and am stoked to see it continuing to get upgrades. That tells me enough people are buying these models to keep some of Apple’s attention. (Is this where we pour one out for the iPhone mini? Dang, I miss that thing!) Benjamin Mayo: The M4 iPad Pro is undeniably cool. The thinness and compactness of the design is remarkable, and it leaves a lasting impression. The screen is great, and the M4 chip is crazy fast, even in a 5.1mm thin fanless tablet form factor. That product is a momentous achievement. Unfortunately, iPadOS remains woefully underdeveloped. At the very least, I appreciated that the iPad software got the iOS 18 home screen customization features at the same time as the iPhone did, rather than it being a year behind as has happened in the past. Dan Moren: The iPad’s frustrations are eternal. Although the hardware is fantastic, the software feels increasingly left behind, limited, and, at times, downright clunky. Stage Manager hasn’t fixed the multitasking issue, and the lack of modern audio support continues to keep me from doing my full job there. It’s probably time they let us run macOS or, at the very least, virtualize it. Chance Miller: As usual, you can break the iPad category down into two parts: hardware and software. The new iPad Pro is the most visually impressive product Apple has released in years. I mean, who had Apple comparing the thinness of an iPad Pro to an iPod nano on their bingo card? Software-wise, the iPad continues to falter. iPadOS 18 added nothing new to the experience and Stage Manager feels like abandonware at this point. It’s a real bummer because I’d love to use the iPad Pro more often, especially with the new Magic Keyboard, which rights a lot of what was wrong with the last model. Nick Heer: I still find the iPad-and-accessories lineup confusing, but it is in much better shape this year than last. Apple introducing the M4 chip in an iPad first, and not a Mac, is one of those twists I still find hard to believe, but it happened! I promise! Michael Tsai: This seemed to be the year where a lot of people accepted that the software is what it is. If you love iPadOS, the hardware for running it is now better than ever. If not, no matter how much potential there may be, it’s time to stop waiting for Pro to happen in the way that you want and just use a Mac. David Sparks: My same answer as every year: Solid hardware with too conservative operating system and software. Rosemary Orchard: Nothing whelmed nor underwhelmed me. Marco Arment: Apple finally updated the iPad lineup, and it has all of the strengths and weaknesses it has always had: great hardware with amazing computational power that’s almost impossible to utilize because of software limitations. Shahid Kamal Ahmad: I have the latest iPad Pro Max. I’d have given it a higher mark had the OS been able to use the power of the device better, but as has been heard by many notable commentators, it’s just not there yet; the hardware power continues to massively outpace any progress in delivering that power to the user in a way that suits the iPad without compromising its accessibility. While this is going to be a tough nut for Apple to crack, if they want to sell more devices, they’re going to have to make the iPad more useful. Michael Gartenberg: The iPad is the iPad. At the lower ends, they’re still the best for content consumption, at the high end, the Pro OLED models do deliver the best way to watch Severance on a mobile device. It’s a hard sell for creators to spend the money on a tricked-out iPad with Magic Keyboard when a cheaper MacBook will do the job better for most people. Aleen Simms: The iPad’s hardware is unparalleled, but iPadOS still feels like a failed experiment. The iPads Pro are such stellar pieces of hardware, but the inflexibility of the operating system hamstrings them. I know that many people use iPads to great effect, but most people are unwilling or unable to put in the effort it takes to create workarounds—or they don’t even know that workarounds are possible. Lex Friedman: The iPad product line is confusing. I bought an Air to replace an old Pro. I should have bought a Pro ONLY because Face ID on the iPad is so much better. But iPad Pros are ridiculously expensive. The iPad is great! But the product lines are too much. James Thomson: I genuinely couldn’t remember if there had been new iPads this year. Great hardware that continues to remain underutilized by the software. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues on iPad, too. Joe Rosensteel: I don’t find this platform compelling, and it’s mostly the fault of iPadOS. Shelly Brisbin: The new iPad Pro is great, as is the iPad Air, which adopts tech from the previous Pro. I’m thoroughly happy with my 13-inch Air. I’m not the first to point out iPadOS’ continuing limitations. The better the hardware becomes, the more glaring the software problems become. And it seems there’s little appetite or corporate support for making big changes to the platform. Zac Hall: An even thinner design and optional nanotexture define this generation for me. Quinn Nelson: iPadOS continues to be a “love it or hate it” experience, but the M4 iPad Pro, with its stunning OLED display, feels like a sci-fi-level feat of engineering. Steven Aquino: I was gifted a 13″ M4 iPad Pro (with Magic Keyboard) for my birthday in September. The hardware, most especially the OLED display, is stunning. As to software, although iPadOS does exactly what I need it to do, there’s no question the pace of improvement needs to pick up. John Gruber: The iPad hardware story is excellent. iPad Pros got the M4 chips months ahead of the Mac and now have an excellent nano-texture display option. (Please, Apple: bring nano-texture to the iPhone. Take my money.) The iPad Air got a fine update to the M2 chip in May. And the iPad Mini got its first update since 2021, and thus continues to be a product in Apple’s lineup. But iPadOS still strikes me like the no-man’s-land platform: nowhere near as capable productivity-wise as a Mac; nowhere near as portable or as conceptually simple as an iPhone. I made a concerted effort not to use my iPad for anything but long-form reading in recent months. I find myself noticeably more productive for it. To me, it’s like trying to work with my hands while wearing mittens. Eric Slivka: The iPad Pro, with its incredibly thin form factor, OLED, cutting-edge M4 chip, and landscape front camera, received a great update. The iPad Air also received a solid upgrade, and the long-in-the-tooth iPad mini received its Apple Intelligence upgrade. However, I would still love to see Apple do more on the software side to take advantage of the iPad’s power and screen size. Andy Ihnatko: There has been little progress with the OS or hardware. But we finally got a new iPad Mini, and my heart is full! Rich Mogull: The M4 iPad Pro is a marvel. The new iPad Mini is… well… maybe next time. I’d rate it a solid 4.5, so I rounded up. Stephen Hackett: There’s little to say about the iPad this year that hasn’t been said. The M4 iPad Pro pushes the ole “Wow, this iPad hardware can do so much more than iPadOS will let it” adage to the stratosphere. It’s powerful and thin, with an amazing screen, but it’s still just an iPad. The new Magic Keyboard looks fantastic, but it’s still hooked up to iPad apps. I’ve settled into equilibrium with this in my usage. My iPad mini is a great tablet for what I use it for: YouTube, TV shows, podcasts, and reading. I may hop into Slack or scroll through my mentions on social media, but I’m just no longer interested in turning the iPad into a computer I can or want to use for work. Zooming out, the overall iPad family is still messy in places. Thankfully, the 9th-gen iPad has been sent out to pasture, meaning all iPads finally use the modern gesture system for control. All iPads basically look the same, but there are still numerous differences as you move up and down the product line. The fact that Apple’s iPad keyboard page has a huge dropdown for a user to pick which iPad they have so the website can show them compatible models is not great, but Apple has been making progress. The current line of Apple Pencils is pretty straightforward, and having two models of iPad Air makes a lot of sense. I hope that the company keeps working to restore sense to the iPad hardware line while, at the same time, making iPadOS more capable for those who want to use their iPads more than they can today. Christina Warren: I hope we get a good iPad update in 2025 because I need to buy one for my mom, and I’m annoyed the iPad Air doesn’t ship with 256GB standard, raising the price the $700. The 2024 updates to the iPad Pro were tempting but I kept my 2022 11” iPad Pro because I don’t want to buy a new keyboard or Apple Pencil. And my M2 is still so powerful, given the software is utterly anemic. The problem with the iPad, or at least the iPad Pro, continues to be iPad OS. It just isn’t as robust as I would like for something that costs more than a MacBook Air. And the MacBook Air now has 16GB of RAM standard. And that’s before you have the price for the pencil and keyboard. If you’re going to tout the importance of the form factor, don’t nerf what I can do with it. It’s especially annoying when you can run many iPad apps on the Mac and use your iPad as a second display with touch support on the same Mac. So I continue to be mad that I can’t run VS Code or something like it on my iPad. And that my web browser on my $1000+ tablet cannot even run real web apps super well. The iPad Air is probably the ideal iPad for the middle-of-the-road user, though I think a 256GB 10th gen iPad is probably just fine too. I forgot Apple even updated the iPad mini this year. I think Apple did, too. Adam Engst: At least Apple released new iPads after a year off, but they don’t change the game at all. I’ve basically stopped using the iPad at this point, and none of the new models give me any reason to rethink that. Performance isn’t the problem. Myke Hurley: I am no longer going to grade the iPad on the disappointment of iPadOS. I have accepted the iPad for what it is rather than what I want it to be. The new M4 iPad Pro is everything I wanted. I use the 11-inch as my main device at home, and I love everything about it. The OLED screen is fantastic, and it is so thin and light—it’s a joy to use. John Siracusa: The M4 is a great iPad chip, but the highlight of the year for me was the Tandem OLED display on the new iPad Pro. I use my iPad as a tiny TV most of the time, and OLED displays provide the best picture quality available today. It’s been an amazing upgrade for me, even if it seems like I’m “wasting” that M4 by using it to watch videos for hours on end. Oh yeah, and they updated the camera placement, improved the Apple Pencil, and made all the Pro iPads even thinner. It seems like the rest of the world is not as excited as I am about the new iPad Pro. That may have something to do with the (continuing) limited and confusing nature of iPadOS. But for me, the new M4 iPad Pro is the best iPad ever. Paul Kafasis: The hardware updates were good, but I hoped to see more from the new Mini. I’d been waiting to upgrade to a new Mini, but the minor update meant I bailed on that idea. Casey Liss: While I don’t regret buying a new iPad Pro in 2022… I kind of regret it. The 2024 iPad Pros are really stunning—a phenomenal OLED screen in a case that cannot possibly be that thin. They’re such a joy to hold, and I want one despite having absolutely zero need for one. The Mini was my iPad of choice for many years, but I’ve squeezed it out by the combination of my phone getting ever-larger and the incredible utility the Magic Keyboard brings to my iPad Pro. Jessica Dennis: I pretty much only buy the iPad Mini, and Apple put out a new one in 2024, so I bought it. I like that it’s purple. I was upgrading from a 5th-generation iPad Mini, and other than being snappier (and having TouchID on the power button instead of a button below the screen), I don’t feel like I gained a whole lot. I am not surprised that Regular People suffer from Apple Pencil Confusion — even I had to go back and check which one(s) would work with my new iPad when I was deciding that I didn’t really need one anyway. Alex Cox: The tale as old as time is that iPadOS can’t keep up with the hardware in the iPad. This year, the design of the hardware doesn’t match the internals. Yes, the new form factor and screen options are great, but even the new Magic Keyboard for iPad feels like a mediocre upgrade after four years. The promise of the iPad’s modularity still doesn’t pay off. Eric Linder: I have purchased almost every iPad model since its debut, and I will likely continue to do so. I absolutely love it, and use it every day. But it is such a shame that the hardware improvements are so far out of alignment with its software. One thing I love about Apple is that so often, they underpromise and over-deliver. But with iPad OS, the opposite is the case. They hyped up Stage Manager so much, and I recall the excitement that fellow Apple geeks like Federico Viticci shared with the community. It shipped broken, which is somewhat forgivable, but what is not forgivable is that two years later, it seems like Apple has completely forgotten about it. This does not bode well for the future of iPadOS. Whereas iOS continues to build and iterate on most of its features, it seems like iPadOS is just throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and sadly, not much is sticking. Allison Sheridan: It was a solid year for iPad. The M4 coming to the iPad Pro before the Macs was interesting, while moving the camera to the landscape side was probably a bigger improvement to the user experience. The iPad Air got a modest improvement going to M2 and remains a solid choice. Even the iPad mini finally got an update. Gui Rambo: The fact that after all these years the iPad is still using the exact same foundations as iOS, including its multitasking model, is just baffling. We have iPads with Apple’s most powerful CPU cores that can’t have Final Cut Pro export a video in the background due to these stupid limitations. How would you rate Apple’s performance in Wearables overall in 2024? Consider the Apple Watch, Vision Pro, AirPods, and anything else you deem appropriate. Charles Arthur: The Vision Pro has been a calamity. What it needed was content, and what it also needed was app support. Apple hasn’t done the first, and alienated developers so badly in other areas that it didn’t get the second – Netflix and YouTube being the obvious objectors. If you can’t charm the two biggest content platforms to be on your device, then you are already fighting with one, perhaps both, hands behind your back. The lack of immersive sports content is significant. The Vision Pro will never take off without it. Joe Rosensteel: The Apple Watch is pretty stagnant and has feature regressions thanks to the ongoing patent dispute. The Vision Pro really whiffed. I was filled with ennui when the guy conducting my Vision Pro demo noted how sharp and readable the text was and how it could be used for work… A sentiment I didn’t share at all, and really underscored that people at Apple didn’t really know how to make a $3500 science fiction gadget exciting. Casey Liss: The addition of medical-grade hearing aid functionality to the AirPods Pro is Apple at its best. The AirPods Pro remain possibly my favorite Apple product of all time. I use them on and off all day, every single day. However, the utterly preposterous AirPods Max “refresh” is borderline insulting for fans of that device. I am not a fan of it and yet here I am grumbling about it. (Apple Watch specific stuff follows)I would never have guessed, when working on my 2023 Report Card, that I’d be here working on my 2024 Report Card, still discussing the Masimo lawsuit. It is rather absurd that Apple, a company with effectively infinite resources, hasn’t fixed this problem. Throw money at it in terms of licensing, or just buy Masimo outright. Do something. The Ultra wasn’t bumped in any way this year, which was disappointing. Before the September event, I had assumed I was going to buy myself an Ultra 3 as my new watch. The lack of hardware updates — other than an admittedly hot black case — convinced me to go with a Series 10 instead. I like my Series 10, and I am pleased it’s thinner than my prior Series 8, but it’s otherwise more of the same. The one large difference for me is the addition of fast charging, which is a surprising quality of life improvement — especially if you sleep track. Sigh—what to make of the Vision Pro? I preordered one, and collected it on launch day. It is, without exception, the coolest piece of technology I own. It is unlike anything I had previously experienced, and as I’ve said many times, using a Vision Pro is strapping the future onto your face today. As I write this, today a fortnightly chat with your beloved editor (and three others) is scheduled. These hangouts — which are “just” FaceTime calls — are so uncanny. Those of us who can make any given call will sit, using our Spatial Personas, in the circle the Vision Pro software puts us in, and chitchat. Something about having that presence makes it feel like so much more than the handful of monthly FaceTime calls I have with friends — including one of the others on this fortnightly call. A FaceTime call with my friend James feels like a phone conversation with video. A Spatial FaceTime call with James, Jason, and others… that feels like hanging out. I could make a strong argument that if you and your friends can convince yourselves to spend the absurd amount of money for a Vision Pro, Spatial FaceTime calls are worth it alone. But the killer app for the Vision Pro — if you ever leave your house to do work — is definitely Mac Virtual Display. Just before the end of the year, Apple came out with a second version of MVD, and holy smokes, it’s incredible. My at-home setup is three 5K monitors because, well, I have problems. While my 13″ M3 Max MacBook Pro lets me take all the power of a desktop out of the house, it very much does not let me take all the screen real estate. Well, it didn’t, anyway. Now it does. In fact, the Ultrawide mode on MVD is too wide. A problem that I never thought I’d have. If we can only normalize wearing them, my portable computing life will improve vastly. I have used my Vision Pro at our local library, but I always do so in a study room, because I’m too embarrassed to do so in the throngs of everyone in the main areas. I’m writing this post at a local Wegmans, and I’m doing so without my AVP, because I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. The Vision Pro is incredible, and every time I strap that stupid thing to my face, I can’t believe how lucky I am to have one and how cool this device is. However, I only have the occasion to do so once a week at most. The Vision Pro is an engineering marvel — easy 5. The Vision Pro is frustrating to use by itself and you look like an idiot when you do so — 2. That makes this section a 4 to me — as an engineer, I can’t get past how impressive it is. The Vision Pro is simultaneously more than I ever expected and a near-total letdown. Doing work in it is nigh impossible outside of MVD. Typing is so painful that I avoid it at all costs. Using Siri is not a substitute for a workable keyboard in visionOS. There’s not enough immersive content, although the pace is quickening and the content is getting ever-better. Ultimately, though, it’s too cool for me to grade any lower. Shelly Brisbin: Wearables feels like a category poised to evolve in interesting ways, and I’m here for it. 2024 gave us a couple of glimpses: the technology behind the Vision Pro and the adaptation of a pair of earbuds (AirPods Pro) to the task of finding and mitigating some kinds of hearing loss. I’m with those who admire the Vision Pro but are skeptical of its future as a viable product. I wish Apple were more open to the idea of offering developer-focused technology previews that aren’t necessarily ready for primetime. Let the early adopter/pundit class buy them, too, but set expectations about what the Vision Pro is good at. I recently saw how a developer plans to incorporate the Vision Pro into a wheelchair-based navigation assistant. Now that’s innovation! Marco Arment: Apple Vision Pro was the most disappointing launch I’ve seen from Apple in recent memory, with huge mismatches between the delivered product and consumer priorities and almost no follow-through from Apple to get software or content on the platform. A year after launch, a new owner can still watch the entire catalog of immersive videos during their first evening of taking the Vision Pro home… and then watch some episodes of Severance and still go to bed early. Lex Friedman: Apple Watch remains good. There isn’t much in the way of new features that I’m excited about on the Watch, but it remains good. I wish it were better at tracking steps on a Treadmill Desk, though. Apple Vision Pro remains a product that I am not at all interested in. Rich Mogull: The Apple Watch Ultra is getting close to being a true sports watch, but once you hit that category, Garmin still wins out (despite the latest Fenix updates being lackluster). The rest of the line is solid, but there still feels like room for growth. Eric Slivka: A thinner design for the Series 10 was a welcome change, but otherwise, we didn’t get much in this regard. The black Ultra 2 looks great, but no hardware updates was a disappointment, and we missed out on a rumored SE update as well that sounded like it could have brought some fun colors. I continue to be astonished that Apple hasn’t settled the blood oxygen patent dispute in the U.S. one way or another. Nearly a year in, Vision Pro continues to be a half-baked prototype. AirPods 4 look like a really nice upgrade that has helped modernize and streamline the lineup, but I’m an AirPods Pro user looking forward to a 2025 update on those. AirPods Max simply adopting USB-C and some new colors with no other changes is so sad that it’s hilarious. Stephen Hackett: Apple continues to kill it when it comes to AirPods. The AirPods 4 (especially with ANC) offers incredible value, while the AirPods Pro 2 continue to become more valuable to users through some remarkable software updates. Using AirPods as a way to take a hearing test or have your hearing augmented means millions of people who didn’t even know they had hearing loss will enjoy more moments with their loved ones in conversation. With the Apple Watch, it’s more of the same good vibes. Detecting falls, car crashes, and possible cardiac issues has saved an untold number of people, and with sleep apnea detection in the newest batch of Apple Watches, users can be notified if their Watches detect a problem. This is some of Apple’s most important work. I took the lack of an Apple Watch Ultra 3 personally, but the Series 10’s thinner and more powerful design almost makes up for it, as long as my bought-it-on-launch-day-like-a-maniac Apple Watch Ultra 1 holds on. 2024 saw the launch of the Vision Pro, and it’s unlike any Apple product launch I can remember. The Vision Pro is an incredible feat of engineering. Just holding the thing feels nice, and the years of work that went into it shows when the screens light up. It is the only AR or VR headset I have worn that hasn’t made me feel sick after a few minutes. The Vision Pro is priced like a computer because Mac-level hardware powers its array of cameras and sensors, screens, audio system, and more. visionOS springs to life on this hardware — after a lengthy boot process — and wraps the user in a world of their own content and apps. The floating windows feel real and stay in place as if they are made of actual frosted glass. The pass-through video feed of the outside world is by no means perfect, but it’s fast to respond to a turn of your head. A simple turn of the Digital Crown has the world fade away, dissolving into any number of landscapes that can help you focus on the task at hand. Sadly, there are just a handful of tasks best suited for spatial computing. Text input can be tedious without a keyboard, the lack of any window management tools mean there’s a lot of fussing about needed if you want to look at more than one application at once. (Stage Manager seems like it was built for this thing.) The App Store is quiet on the Vision Pro. The high price of the device has surely limited its adoption from both the user and developer perspectives. The new nature of the platform means users need to experience the Vision Pro before understanding it. Apple Stores have done a good job at this, but most consumers don’t know what they’d do with a device like this beyond playing games, which isn’t Apple’s strength. There’s no killer app for visionOS yet, and even if there was, you end up back at the price tag. Nick Heer: On the plus side, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, and Vision Pro. On the other hand, Apple Watch Ultra New Color, AirPods Max New Colors, and Vision Pro. Christina Warren: AirPod Pro 2 remains one of the best products Apple has ever released. The OTC hearing aid function is such a huge win for so many people. I don’t understand why the AirPods 4 with noise canceling exist, but that’s not my business. Just buy the AirPod Pro 2s on sale. I regret to inform the world that I bought the USB-C AirPods Max. No one else should do the same. An overpriced product that lost features over four years, got zero improvements, and is now priced even worse compared to the competition. As for Apple Watch, I upgraded this year (and to the Hermes edition at that — the Grand H band got me) after sitting out the Series 9 year and I noticed nothing different — though the screen is larger than my Series 8 and the new Hermes band is amazing. But the lack of the blood ox stuff doesn’t impact me, but it’s a regression I dislike. I hope Apple can return this feature in the future. I did not buy an Apple Vision Pro this year and I do not regret my decision. It was a rare example of restraint on my part. I think it is a terrific tech demo and incredibly well-engineered. This sort of technology at theme park rides or in certain scenarios is jaw-dropping. But I could never convince myself I’d use it enough to not feel bad when it inevitably sat unused on my shelf. I can afford to buy one. But I am sadly not rich enough to be able to buy one and not feel angry about its lack of use. The weight and face pressure are also concerns — I’m glad to see the Belkin strap seems to have improved the fit. The lack of apps, let alone a killer app, outside of watching movies alone, is an indictment of Apple’s developer relations problems as much as it is an indictment of the AVP itself. I can’t help but think Apple’s focus on AR/VR at the expense of things like AI was a mistake, and I’m not convinced we’ll ever see the promise of Apple Vision Pro. Again, incredible tech demo. But I can’t convince myself to buy one and I love to use girl math to make bad decisions. It is what it is. Myke Hurley: I feel like this was a miss year for the Apple Watch from a hardware perspective – thinner is great, but I want to see more design change! However, watchOS 11 is a really great advancement. I love the enhancements to widgets and the Smart Stack, as well as the inclusion of live activities. The new Photos face is amazing. I love the fact that I get these moments of joy every time I look down at my watch, as it picks a photo to show me from a vacation or a cute photo of my wife. I cannot wait to see photos of my baby on this. The Vision Pro is a real mixed bag. The launch was so exciting, the hardware is so futuristic, and visionOS is overall a good operating system with some good advancements through the year. But the lack of developer support, and the loss of buzz for the product over the year cannot be ignored. I really hope for more, as I believe in the platform. But I could not give it the mark I had hoped for. Benjamin Mayo: Before this year, I had always assumed noise cancellation would be the AirPod Pro’s differentiating feature. I have a dislike for the feel of the in-ear tips, so I had just accepted I would always be missing out on that. But 2024 brought the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and it’s amazing. The noise cancellation is incredibly effective given the open-earbud design. Even the non-ANC base model is way better value for money than what Apple previously sold at that price point. Peter Cohen: The Vision Pro will be a fantastic product when it’s ready to come out of beta in a couple of years. Federico Viticci: I love my new AirPods 4, and I find the combination of no in-ear tips and basic noise cancellation a fantastic balance of trade-offs and comfort. I didn’t rely on AirPods Pro’s advanced noise cancellation and other audio features that much, so switching to the “simpler” AirPods 4 when they were released was a no-brainer for me. As flawed as the Vision Pro can be (it is, after all, a fancy developer kit with an almost non-existent third-party app ecosystem), I also think it’s an impressive showcase of what Apple can do with hardware and miniaturization if money is not a concern and engineers are free to build whatever they want. I don’t use the Vision Pro on a regular basis, but whenever I do, I’m reminded that visionOS is an exciting long-term prospect for what I hope will eventually be shrunk down to glasses. That, in fact, is the reason why I’m not giving this category 5 stars. I really want to stop using my Meta Ray-Ban glasses, but Apple doesn’t have an alternative that I can purchase today – and worse, it sounds like their version may not be ready for quite some time still. It seems like Apple is, at this point, almost institutionally incapable of releasing a minimum viable product that doesn’t have to be a complete platform with an entire app ecosystem and a major marketing blitz. I just want Apple to make a pair of glasses that combine AirPods, Siri, and a basic camera. I don’t need Apple to make XR glasses that project a computer in front of my eyes today. And I wish the company would understand this – that they would see the interest in “simple” glasses that have speakers, a microphone, and a camera, and release that product this year. I hope they change their minds and can fast-track such a product rather than wait for visionOS to support that kind of form factor years from now. Brent Simmons: Got new AirPods in 2024 — they won’t stay in my ear. I tried Vision Pro and am not surprised it didn’t sell well, especially at that price. Kirk McElhearn: The Vision Pro developer kit looks like it is full of innovations, but just doesn’t seem like something I’d want to use. Who wants to wear a computer strapped to their face for a long time? And the price is out of reach for most users. As a proof of concept, it’s interesting, but the mere concept of that device, and the way Apple has promoted it, feels like an episode of Black Mirror. Michael Gartenberg: Watch seems to have stagnated with some odd choices. Watch 10 has a screen that can do things Watch Ultra can’t, even though Ultra remains the best choice for battery life (and replacing the Rolex Submariner as the watch for desk athletes). The new back titanium is pretty, along with the new titanium bands. AirPods also got a weird upgrade with the new models lacking the hearing aid features that live in the pro models. As someone who listened to his iPod too loud at the turn of the century, I found the hearing features to work pretty well, but they aren’t replacements for OTC hearing aids. The battery life is way too short, and it’s kind of socially awkward to talk to someone when you have earbuds in, needing to explain that you really are listening to them and not tuning them out. I do think there’s a great opportunity for Apple to build a true hearing-first, music-second device for users. It’s clear they have the technology, and this is an area where Apple can really shine with a product to fill a need and make all the other products in that category obsolete. The less said about Vision Pro, the better for Apple. It’s been a long time since Apple took a swing for the fences and struck out. AVP remains a device that should have been called a developer kit or “peek at the future” science experiment, not as an end-user product. It’s an odd case where Apple tried to leapfrog the market and be first but also flawed. AVP doesn’t compete with anything on the market. It’s a device all alone in that space at that price. Apparently it’s great for watching Ted Lasso on your ceiling, according to Tim, but not really useful for much else. Ironically, the sleeper wearable/AI came from Meta, with their collaboration with Ray-Ban. Meta chose a subset of features such as photos/music/messaging/AI that relies on your phone to do the heavy lifting, works reliably well and comes in a form factor that’s actually fashion friendly. It’s the type of device with feature set and partnership that Apple could have and should have done. All the features would tie wonderfully into Apple’s ecosystem. Meta didn’t even haggle over branding—the Ray-Bans just say Ray-Ban. It’s not too late for Apple to do something similar, but I doubt that they would do a product copy if for no other reason than out of pride. Quinn Nelson: The Vision Pro is expensive and uncomfortable. It’s too heavy, the straps are awful, the software feels primitive and limited, and it lacks the robust first- and third-party app support it desperately needs. Even Mac Virtual Display isn’t polished enough to replace a dedicated desktop monitor. In short, it feels unfinished. But despite all that, it has improved significantly since launch—and I still find myself looking for excuses to use it because every time I put it on, I can’t help but think, “holy crap, this is incredible.” Andy Ihnatko: The Vision Pro isn’t an embarrassment for Apple; it’s fine. It’s not the breakthrough, paradigm-destroying hit product for 2024 that Apple imagined when they started developing the Vision Pro in earnest in 2016. Unfortunately, the TVA pruned that timeline during the most boring episode of “Loki” ever. Here in Earth-616, the Vision Pro is just a high-end version of one of those VR headsets that nobody really needs. Jessica Dennis: The newer, thinner Apple Watch is legitimately pretty great (and I’m grateful that I could still use all my existing bands). I was kinda bummed that there was no stainless steel model this year; I had psyched myself up to finally upgrade from aluminum, but I didn’t particularly care for the titanium models, so went with the jet black aluminum after all. I do really love all the ultramarine accessories, though — my phone and phone case are also ultramarine. Brian Mattucci: I love the new Apple Watch, and have no complaints. I was all set to upgrade to USB-C AirPods Max, but they didn’t change anything else about them so I had to pass. As for Vision Pro, I held off on even trying it for many months, largely due to all of the negative things I heard about it. But then I did the store demo and ended up buying one. I’ve used it nearly every single day since, and I’m very happy with it. I don’t fault Apple for creating an expensive device for early adopters (like me), but I do fault them for not doing enough to allow for a thriving App Store. Rumors of PSVR2 controller support are welcome, but late. I know Vision Pro isn’t primarily for games and that’s not why anyone would buy one at this point, but it adds value to the device and helps people justify the purchase (especially of an eventual more reasonably priced version). While AVP is a weighty device, I don’t find it uncomfortable with the solo loop alone. Everyone’s skull is different, and there are many options out there, but I think it requires a lot of a person to understand how to wear AVP comfortably and people simply aren’t used to it. Other complaints I’ve found don’t really apply to me (FOV) or aren’t that big of a deal to me (glare). Ultimately I think AVP is their best first-gen device ever and I’m excited to see how the next several revisions improve on things. I hope it doesn’t take them years to add folder support though – my home screen is a mess. Rosemary Orchard: I need an Apple Watch Ultra that fits on my wrist. Allison Sheridan: The clear winner on wearables this year were the AirPods. Redesigning them to fit more ear shapes caught my eye originally. but noise cancellation in the non-Pros has made them a big draw. The OTC hearing aid features of the Pros is also compelling. Apple Watch was a very modest improvement. Dr. Drang: AirPods are such a good product that Apple is now adding features I have to turn off. Head gestures seemed like a good idea until I looked both ways before crossing the street when a question was pending. John Gruber: AirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update, and AirPods Pro 2, though years-old hardware, saw significant software improvements—most notably, widely acclaimed support for use as certified hearing aids. AirPods continue to exemplify Apple its best. Series 10 watches feature a new display that supports once-per-second updates while in energy-saving always-on mode. So the seconds hand on an analog face can “tick” once per second even when the display isn’t fully on. But Apple only enabled this ticking seconds indicator on two watch faces, both new to WatchOS 11: Flux and Reflections. Setting aside the fact that I personally don’t like either of those faces (Flux in particular seems deliberately obtuse), this is ridiculous. WatchOS 11 offers, by my quick count, at least 33 different watch faces that offer a non-digital seconds hand or indicator. And only two of them support the new 1Hz refresh rate? That’s bullshit. And it wasn’t just a launch thing, because here we are in January and no additional watch faces have been updated to support it. This is not how a serious watchmaker treats its watches. I will admit to caring far more about always-on second hands than most people, but what a waste of a technical breakthrough. Not just most, but every single watch face should have been updated to support ticking seconds. Apple Watch is turning more into a fitness tracker that happens to show the time, and away from serving as a proper watch. Also: no Ultra 3 this year. The year-old Ultra 2 did gain a very nice black titanium color option, but that’s it. Kind of weird for a watch that starts at $800 to skip a year of silicon improvements. Is Vision Pro a hit? No, far from it. But I remain unconvinced that Apple ever had much hope that this first Vision device would sell in much higher quantities than it has. The narrative that it’s a laughably overpriced bust reminds me of the original Macintosh in 1984, whose $2,500 price tag, adjusted for inflation, works out to over $7,500 in today’s dollars. After an initial wave of publicity on launch, the original Macintosh sold so poorly that it was arguably the impetus for John Sculley and Apple’s board to fire Steve Jobs and exile him from the company. Many pundits of the era confidently proclaimed that the entire concept of a GUI was a gimmick with no future. Am I predicting that the Vision platform will have as bright and essential a future ahead of it as the Macintosh did in 1984? No. But I suspect it has a bright and essential future ahead of it. The entire concept and paradigm is so new and different that, like the Macintosh 40 years prior, the product had to ship years before a version could be made at a price that appeals to the mass market, and years before there’s all that much to do using it. But, as it stands, Vision Pro today offers an incredible experience for watching traditional movies and shows, and a breakthrough experience for watching spatial content. If Bang & Olufsen sold this product in a form that only played movies — no “spatial computing” — it would cost $10,000 and some people would consider it well worth the price. Spatial computing feels fun to me, but not very productive. That could change, and I suspect “fun but not productive” is how I would have described trying to work on a Macintosh in 1984 vs. an Apple II. And Vision Pro’s remarkable (and with VisionOS 2, much improved) Mac Virtual Display feature is a highly-productive environment for work. I can’t give Vision Pro an A for 2024, but I foresee A’s in future years. John Siracusa: At best, the Vision Pro seems like a first step on a long journey. It will require many years of dedication, and perhaps some significant pivots, to turn this platform into a success. After spending a decade and several billion dollars on a car project that never shipped, I hope Apple can muster the resolve to keep plugging away at the Vision Pro. The new AirPods 4 are great for those of us who don’t want our headphones to be shoved into our ear canals. The noise canceling cannot compete with literal earplugs that are the AirPods Pro, but it’s still a nice improvement. The smaller size of both the earbuds and the case are also great. After a brief burst of excitement from the Apple Watch Ultra a few years ago, we appear to be in a holding pattern again as we wait for a more radical redesign of the mainstream Apple watch. The new watches this year were fine, though. Steven Aquino: Apple Watch, AirPods, and Vision Pro all are winners in general. The new Apple Watch’s bigger screen in a lightweight package is lovely, especially after wearing an Ultra for 2 years solely for its big screen. Vision Pro is the most accessible content consumption device I’ve ever used, but it is heavy, and the app story for streaming TV and movies feels thin other than TV+ and Disney+. Matt Birchler: The Apple Watch seems to be coasting along, which isn’t terrible, but it seems like that product is approaching its effective final form, while AirPods continue to get really good software updates that make them more valuable over time (except for AirPods Max, of course). The Vision Pro really drops this category down, as it does have some devotees, but they seem to be a huge minority of purchasers. There was chatter after the Vision Pro’s unveiling at WWDC 2023 that it sucked the energy out of the LLM “fad” that was just getting off the ground, but at the end of 2024 I think it’s clear that the Vision Pro is far more niche and unexciting than we thought it would be nearly one year into its time on the market. Aleen Simms: I’m glad they released the Vision Pro, but it still feels like a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist (for most people). I’m interested to see where Apple decides to take it over the next several iterations, assuming they continue product development. A convenient, glasses-like wearable could be a major accessibility boon for a lot of people. Michael Tsai: The AirPods 4 seem good. AirPods Max remains a product in Apple’s lineup. Apple no longer offers software updates for my watch, and I’m waiting for a new Apple Watch SE, which hasn’t been announced yet. Apple Vision Pro is technically impressive, but it increasingly seems like Apple built the wrong thing. Those engineering resources would have been much better spent improving Apple’s other platforms. Chance Miller: The AirPods Pro 2, despite being over two years old, are the standout wearable product of the year. The new hearing health features will go down as one of Apple’s most important releases of all time. Apple Vision Pro gets a lot more hate than it deserves. I’ve had very few if any, technological experiences as magical as interacting with it. Apple has work to do if it wants Apple Vision Pro (or whatever “Vision” product comes next) to truly become the future of computing. The good news is that I think Apple is taking the feedback in stride and will continue to perfect the spatial computing experience in years to come. The Apple Watch Series 11 is the first Apple Watch that feels like it sits flat on my wrist. It’s a subtle change, but one I notice every day. Andrew Laurence: Barely one year into the Vision Pro’s product life, I it feels like the early days of the Apple Watch — also introduced with a set of features that showed a puzzling lack of vision. Over time, the Watch found its market of utility, and apps sprung up around it. We’ll see if the same happens with Vision Pro. Meanwhile… is Vision Pro, like Apple Intelligence, a case of organizational FOMO leaking out to product? I, for one, have zero interest in “strap something to my face” computing. Might Apple Watch’s greatest impact be a generational change in product naming? Since the Watch, Apple’s wholly new products and services have followed its naming convention of “Apple Product”, with “Product” being a generic category word. Since then, Cisco retired “AnyConnect” for “Cisco Secure Client”; Dell retired years of brand equity for the same convention of “Dell Product.” Is “Ford Truck” next? AirPods Pro 2 continues to be my most consistently superlative purchase in some years. Carolina Milanesi: Apple Watch has become a cornerstone of the ecosystem for many users and a device that is keeping users in the ecosystem, as competition on the phone side is growing in Android both on form factor and AI. Paul Kafasis: AirPods updates have been great. Apple Watch, well, they really need to fix their patent situation. Vision Pro… God, so much hype, and it sure seems like a pretty big flop. From all I can see, even those people who were excited about it are finding themselves not using it. Alex Cox: Apple Vision Pro is the most influential hardware I’ve ever used, and I don’t have anyone to else to use it with, make things with it, or even demo it unless they’re willing to sit for forty minutes to make sure the guest mode calibration works. Apple is getting in the way of letting AVP grow, and not just because of the price. Until there’s developer access to more APIs and more accessibility to dev kits, I don’t think there will be anything interesting made for AVP that isn’t a big-budget immersive video partially funded by Apple. David Sparks: The Vision Pro deserves better than its current reputation as a pundit punching bag. While everyone’s busy dunking on Apple’s spatial computing experiment, I’m regularly strapping it on and using it for work and entertainment. It’s definitely first-generation, but there’s something genuinely compelling here. I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes. Adam Engst: The big story in 2024 for wearables is the AirPods Pro 2 and their hearing health and hearing aid capabilities. Those have the potential to be life-changing for many people. Otherwise, it’s hard to get excited about the changes to the Apple Watch Series 10. The Vision Pro is impressive technology that completely misses the mark in terms of being useful and affordable. Dan Moren: The AirPods Pro 2’s Hearing Aid feature is probably the biggest announcement in all of Apple’s wearables lines this year. It’s truly impressive, even if it’s not something that everybody’s going to use. But this is where Apple’s Health initiatives shine: solving actual problems people have and doing so in a way that’s accessible to the masses. I find the Vision Pro fascinating, but have spent so little time with one that I can’t offer more than that. I hope the next one’s cheaper. Dave Hamilton: The hearing features added to AirPods Pro 2 are a HUGE game-changer in my world. The active earplugs feature works so well that these have replaced my custom-fit musicians’ earplugs as my default earplugs for concerts. As for Vision Pro, I’m eager to see where Apple takes it, but it’s obviously just a public beta at this point of some very cool, extremely overpriced tech. James Thomson: The Vision Pro is a fantastically impressive technological achievement that no normal person should actually buy. The hearing aid functionality for the AirPods Pro could genuinely change lives. Craig Hockenberry: I have largely ignored the Vision Pro, and it appears I am not alone. I still don’t see a reason to put the thing on my head for hours each day. Michael E. Cohen: I have a Vision Pro and really like it, but mostly as the best widescreen and 3D video-watching experience I’ve ever experienced. The device needs more apps, especially the kind of apps only Apple can provide that demonstrate to other developers both the device’s unique (and sometimes less obvious) capabilities and the best ways to make those capabilities accessible to users. How would you rate Apple’s overall performance in Home technology in 2024? Consider HomeKit, the Home app, Matter, overall strategy and anything else you deem appropriate. Rosemary Orchard: I love the support of Matter. But feel more progress needs to be made. Lex Friedman: The Home app is ugly. Home app integrations in Control Center are useful but inflexible. Dave Hamilton: Attending CES the past two years, I saw a marked shift in how much Matter mattered to vendors. (I had to do it.) Last year, everyone was stoked to tell me they had added Matter support to their various widgets. This year, it was mentioned as an afterthought, “Oh, and yes, we’ll support Matter if and when that becomes important to our customers.” Myke Hurley: The new Control Center actions I can add have saved Apple’s Home efforts for me this year. Outside of that, I am not sure of anything else I could focus on. I hope for a 5/5 next year, though. Michael Gartenberg: The digital home is a mess, and Apple is doing its best to tame it in an Apple way. No one is doing a better job but no one is doing a great job either for consumers to implement. Steven Aquino: As an Apple user, I love the idea of HomeKit. The smart home makes tasks like turning lights on and off more accessible. What frustrates me, however, is its unreliability. I see “No Response” statuses way more often than I’d like, and it sullies the overall experience. Christina Warren: I don’t understand why Apple continues to pretend to invest in this area. Pro tip: use Home Assistant, the excellent open-source project that will let all your IoT stuff talk to one another using whatever you want — rather than trying to get HomeKit to do what it claims it is going to do. John Gruber: I can’t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements. Fingers crossed for 2025, though. I know there are talented people on that team, and they have to be up to something. Adam Engst: Did anything happen in 2024? Eric Slivka: 2025 sounds like it might be the year of the home for Apple, so 2024 didn’t see very much. The HomePod family managed only to replace the Space Gray mini with a Midnight one. HomeKit remains finicky at times, and I’m not sure Matter has helped much. David Sparks: This year, Apple made many nice quality-of-life improvements, including better Matter support, control center widgets, and (in my experience) more platform stability. There’s room for improvement, and I am interested in Apple possibly making its own accessories. But overall, I think Apple moved the needle in a positive direction. Casey Liss: The following is what I wrote for the 2024 report card. Word for word. Every word of it remains true, except now I’m using Home Assistant instead of Homebridge. I bumped my rating from 2 → 1 because, holy smokes, can we get some forward progress here, please? Same as it ever was. HomeKit is unreliable and doesn’t work with enough devices. It pains me that I have to run Homebridge. That’s not necessarily Apple’s fault, but it’s also not not Apple’s fault. Matter seems to be a total nothingburger. Same story: not their fault, but not not their fault. Though I’ve never owned a HomePod, I’ve heard continual grumbling of them failing. No thanks. Michael Tsai: My HomePod continues to not work well for Siri or music. This year, I dipped my toes into the Matter ecosystem. I was pleased to find that it all “just worked,” though the automation options are a bit limited, and I still don’t like the Home app. Paul Kafasis: Someday, the Home app and smart home controls will be better. They are still not this year, though! I have assorted Shortcuts to do things, and they seem to have gotten slower. Rich Mogull: As a 20-year home automation enthusiast with over 100 connected devices and a lot of automation code, I have historically rated this lower, but the combo of the Home app and Siri just gets the job done these days. I have no issues connecting what I need to and making it do what I want. A better Siri could easily bump this to a 5. Shelly Brisbin: Make the Home app better. It’s still awful. Matt Birchler: I scored this right down the middle because I don’t recall Apple doing much this year in the home category. However, I do have all of my smart home items in the Home app, and it works pretty well for me. In a post-Matter world, I have my choice of apps to use for this since my devices show up everywhere, but I still gravitate towards Apple’s app. Craig Hockenberry: If you had told me ten years ago that I’d have a phone app that controlled my 104-year-old home, I’d have laughed. Yet here we are: thanks to HomeKit, lights, heating, entertainment, and even a coffee pot are all seamlessly connected. Peter Cohen: Does Apple have a Home strategy? Does it really Matter? John Siracusa: Siri continues to be a boat anchor weighing down the HomePod and other HomeKit accessories. Apple Intelligence hasn’t even come to most home devices and probably won’t until they get hardware upgrades. Marco Arment: HomeKit continues to mostly work, but the promised world of Matter has still not materialized. The HomePod remains a buggy mess, and there are few signs of effort on either front. Benjamin Mayo: Apple kinda skipped this year as far as the smart home is concerned, so it’s hard to really pass judgment positively or negatively. I was disappointed by the lack of any Apple Intelligence strategy for the HomePod, though. Chance Miller: With the continued rollout of Matter, I expected a bigger upgrade to the Home app and HomeKit ecosystem in 2024. That didn’t happen. Apple has already lost so much of this market to other companies, but I’m hoping to see a renewed focus in 2025 with new hardware products and much-needed improvements to the Home app. Stephen Hackett: HomeKit continues to hum along, working better and better each year. The ecosystem continues to expand; if Matter ever really arrives, which ecosystem a particular product supports will become a moot question. Rumors are swirling about Apple entering new markets, with cameras, locks, and even smart screens a possibility for 2025 or later. We will have to judge those offerings if/when they arrive, but I’m fascinated to see what Apple would bring to the table. Federico Viticci: My entire apartment is wired to HomeKit, but I don’t love HomeKit because I’m tired of purchasing third-party hardware that doesn’t have the same degree of quality control that Apple typically brings to the table. I’m intrigued by the idea of Apple finally waking up and making a HomePod with a screen that could potentially serve as a flexible, interactive home hub. That’s a first step, and I hope it won’t disappoint. Seriously, though: I just would love for Apple to make routers again. Andrew Laurence: This technology enthusiast has yet to embrace Home or any of the “smart” home generations. All I hear about it is janky futzing and interoperability issues. These sound like problems, not solutions. Call me when it achieves the “Spouse acceptance factor” that TiVo had in 2000. Quinn Nelson: Another year, another bare-minimum effort from Apple to make any meaningful strides in the smart home space—beyond some obligatory Matter point updates. Apple Intelligence should play a key role in the home ecosystem, but the necessary software and hardware just aren’t there yet. Honestly, it feels like we’re still a few years away from Apple finally recommitting to the platform that needs it the most. Rob Griffiths: The Home app is a dreadful piece of software. Although I’m fairly technical, I still find it confusing, and the layout and home screen design are abysmal. Joe Rosensteel: I have experienced many bugs with Home. Even after I switched to the new home architecture, the tvOS 18.0 beta broke, and Apple TVs could not be used as a home hub for a few months. I replaced a bunch of WeMo smart plugs with Eve Energy smart plugs for no good reason other than WeMo just got flakey. There is no forward progress on the Home app, which remains a clunky pain in the butt. I still can’t add or remove seasonal devices (like smart plugs for my Christmas decorations) without it freaking out. I have Siri tell me it can’t turn on a scene from my Watch, but it can from my iPhone. It’s just a pervasive irritation that works often enough that I don’t rip it all out. Jeff Carlson: Still a mess, even though some of that is outside of Apple’s control. But come on, it’s been like this for years. Maybe 2025 will be the Year of Matter or whatever. I’ll save this comment for next year’s survey. James Thomson: How long have I been giving Apple the benefit of the doubt that this will be the year they turn around their Home strategy? Zac Hall: Home is a category that remains in the Six Colors Report Card lineup. Allison Sheridan: I continue to be disappointed in the Home app itself. The interface isn’t getting less baffling than it ever was, even for a seasoned user. Scenes vs. Automations continue to break my brain. “One of your devices didn’t respond” is a message that could use a slight improvement; WHICH ONE??? The only good news I see on this front is that at CES, Matter was all the rage, causing vendors to proudly display compatibility with HomeKit. Charles Arthur: Never improves. The commands haven’t changed: being able to put an IF statement in would make such a difference. (Yes, you can do it with Shortcuts if you have the patience, but who does? Why should you have to divert out of the Home app, which has Actions, to Shortcuts?) Dr. Drang: I like my new HomePods mini, but Siri still hampers their value. Carolina Milanesi: Does Apple even care anymore? Glenn Fleishman: I’m giving Home a low rating because, despite improvements to the Home app across platforms, including the important issue of granting guests access, it’s still a bloody mess of an interface. I’ve added several smart things to my network in recent months: a lock, outlet switches to control lights, a porch HomeKit bulb, more cameras, a doorbell cam, and a thermostat in a guest room—the management process is not wonderful. It’s inflexible, things break, and the connections among devices feel fragile. Apple hasn’t managed to convince many more manufacturers to buy into HomeKit, which means the set of supported options hasn’t grown much, particularly in the doorbell market. Automations remain limited and frustrating about what you can use as triggers and linking activities. For instance, I’d like to set my porchlight to go on for some time in the evening to early morning but also have it turn on when someone approaches the house other times, then turn off within minutes after that if it’s not within the period it should be continuously on. It cannot be done (to my knowledge, testing, and inquiry). I feel like some X10 systems of many years gone by had greater configuration options than I can achieve in some cases with Home. Even setting up a simple “away on vacation” setting requires lots of grouping and programming, and I am unable to see how I could set up random on/off times, which are usual to simulate people at home. (Some third-party apps for HomeKit-connected outlets and lamps offer these features.)The new sharing feature, too, doesn’t let me share lights—only locks, alarms, etc. So someone can’t housesit and be able to access the house’s lights and such without a full invitation. I’d like Apple to put in a lot of rethink about Home in general and come up with something dramatically better that fits the quantity and utility of what HomeKit is good for. How would you rate how the Apple TV hardware and tvOS software platform went in 2024? Consider anything you deem relevant to the platform. (Do not address the Apple TV+ streaming service.) Matt Birchler: After a few years of tvOS updates making the platform more annoying and more clearly an advertising platform for the shows Apple thinks I should watch more than what I am currently watching, it was nice for tvOS not to move further down this road in 2024. However, I recently used Google TV for a few weeks and was shocked to find numerous features that I greatly preferred on that platform. I really do hope Apple is looking at competitors and finding the good stuff they can adopt in their box. Rich Mogull: There is not a single other privacy-preserving device for the streaming age. Not one. And the Apple TV works well and looks and sounds better than nearly anything else. Joe Rosensteel: Apple really isn’t making any progress on tvOS. I use my Apple TV every day, and it is the only set-top box I would recommend to people, but that doesn’t mean Apple perfected the form. Things are more or less in the same state they were in at the end of 2023 when the Home app was updated with that sidebar that mostly can’t be customized. We still don’t have a unified Home and TV app experience. We don’t have anything for live entertainment short of sports notifications. We don’t have any kind of firm policy on pause screen ads (see the YouTube screensaver controversy from 2024). Apple hasn’t enticed anyone new to add support for the jog wheel they introduced on the remote in 2021. James Thomson: Hardware not updated since 2022, software feels like it barely changes each year, and yet still the best streaming device to buy. Allison Sheridan: Nothing went wrong but it’s been two years since they’ve changed the hardware. Steven Aquino: The Apple TV box is laughably over-engineered for what it mainly does: stream content. I appreciate the horsepower, to be sure, but the point stands. Software-wise, I’m still holding my breath for tvOS to have its iOS 7 moment. The grid of icons UI is good in some ways, but on a screen as large as a television’s, there is a lot of untapped potential. Widgets, etc. Chance Miller: The hardware feels as uninspired as ever, but the Apple TV is still the best streaming set-top box. Everything else is a poorly designed, ad-ridden mess. The Apple TV app could sure use some love, though. Quinn Nelson: Little was done, but little was needed. Benjamin Mayo: A minor year for the Apple TV box with no new hardware in sight. However, tvOS 18 did include a handful of niceties, like automatic subtitles and a much better Enhance Dialogue algorithm. Casey Liss: The Apple TV remains a product in Apple’s lineup. I am an Apple TV apologist and superfan. Other than a couple of Nintendo consoles, it’s the only thing that’s connected to my TV. We watch live TV using the wonderful Channels app. We watch movies and shows on Plex, the infuriating Apple TV app, and Disney+. My wife and I do our exercise using a couple of apps on the Apple TV. It’s is our TV, for all intents and purposes. However, our Apple TV HD is getting really long in the tooth, and though we only use it on rare occasions, it’s still getting pretty painful. It’s our third-tier Apple TV, and I’m anxiously awaiting the time when we can upgrade the main one, and thus trickle our 4K first-gen down and retire the HD. We haven’t really had any noteworthy changes to tvOS in… years? While on the one side, I’m not sure what I’m really seeking; on the other side, it feels like Apple has mostly forgotten that tvOS exists. John Siracusa: I continue to be frustrated with the poor quality of many of the streaming video apps I use on Apple TV, both in terms of bugs and interface design. Is that Apple’s fault? Maybe only to the extent that these apps are using standard Apple frameworks for things like video playback. But Apple also isn’t exactly leading by example when it comes to user-centric design. TV apps everywhere continue to prioritize the needs of the streaming service over my needs as a viewer. I want to continue watching my show. They want to shove a bunch of new content in my face while making the show I was just watching as difficult to find as possible. And they don’t seem to care if they lose my place or fail to track my progress. And heaven forbid I go back to refresh my memory by watching a scene from an earlier episode. Now my current place in the series is apparently impossible for modern technology to discern. Craig Hockenberry: The only thing I hate about Apple TV is how every damn service has its own weird user interface. Still, the Apple TV is the best general-purpose entertainment device for the post-cable world. Michael Gartenberg: It feels like Apple TV has not only gone back to being a hobby but a hobby that you started investing a lot of money in and got bored with. I’d give it a lower score, but the Snoopy screensaver is cute. Rosemary Orchard: Still using my Apple TV from last year?! Paul Kafasis: I’m a big fan of the Apple TV. I’m willing to pay a premium over other hardware to get an ad-free, upscale experience. That said, I’d like to see some new hardware here. Michael Tsai: Nothing much happened this year, though I like the new feature of automatically showing subtitles when you rewind a bit. I still don’t like the software or the remote. Lex Friedman: My cable company discontinued its support for Cable Cards, so I switched to its cable-over-streaming offer. However, this functionality works only on iOS, Fire Tablets, and Apple TV. So, I’m now reliant on Apple TV to watch cable TV, which I use almost exclusively to watch NFL games. It works just fine. Marco Arment: Apple TV continues to be a product in Apple’s lineup. Andrew Laurence: Nearly all our TV viewing goes through our Apple TV 4K. In the “streaming box” category, Apple competes at 5-10x the cost of its popular rivals. As a middle-aged technology nerd, I value its user experience and privacy stance. My college-aged kids are content with the built-in TV apps or a $25 stick from Roku or Amazon. Apple TV can play more roles than just a streaming box; is the whole, in fact, greater than the sum of its parts? Myke Hurley: Steady. Adam Engst: I appreciate that Apple has finally improved its photo screensavers, but why does the Portraits screensaver, which works like the iPhone Lock Screen/Apple Watch Photos face, ruin every photo by displaying the time over it? Eric Slivka: No new Apple TV hardware for the second year in a row, and only minor tvOS updates leave us wanting as we await the home revolution of 2025. I would still like to see a cheaper stick-style Apple TV option. John Gruber: I’m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what exactly improved or changed in 2024? Anything? It may well be fair to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we’re grading what happened in 2024. Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote control for this platform. Christina Warren: Apple obviously cares a lot about Apple TV+. It seems to care a lot less about tvOS and the Apple TV hardware. Another year, more lack of updates on hardware or significant updates on software and a price delta between other boxes that doesn’t improve. Especially since Apple has good TV+ apps on Roku, Fire TV and Google TV — not to mention stuff for TV makers like LG and Samsung. Jeff Carlson: Apple TV still doesn’t feel like it’s changed a whole lot, but I still swear by it because it’s not the crapware that every other vendor creates. Stephen Hackett: For the 2023 Report Card, I wrote, “The Apple TV hardware has been so overpriced and overpowered for so long that it feels like I’m wasting everyone’s time by mentioning it again.” I also said, “tvOS continues to feel trapped between Apple’s vision for the platform and what it can work out with streaming giants like Netflix.” Yup. Carolina Milanesi: Nothing to see here – no pun intended! Andy Ihnatko: Until Apple decides to give Apple TV a mission beyond “run streaming apps and generally be invisible,” it’s a solid 3 out of 5 by its nature. I’m giving it a 4 because of the new Snoopy screensavers. Glenn Fleishman: I still find tvOS’s UI primitive, but I use it for about 95% of my video watching across many apps, and it generally serves the purpose. Feels stale compared to other options and sometimes frustrating in terms of scrubs and basic rewind/fast forwarding. This may be a function of app implementation, such as how YouTube stinks and others don’t. How would you rate Apple’s performance in services in 2024? Consider the App Store (from a consumer perspective), Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple Pay, AppleCare, and anything else you deem appropriate. Brian Mattucci: I’m thrilled that Apple Music Classical finally got CarPlay support, but it’s still missing on Mac and AVP. Michael Tsai: iMessage and Siri still work poorly for me. Apple Pay and the rest of iCloud are OK. The other services don’t interest me except that their existence seems to be warping Apple’s product design decisions. Craig Hockenberry: I’m not a fan of how pitching services has become part of the modern Apple software experience. When I check my stock portfolio, I don’t need to be reminded of Apple News+. Carolina Milanesi: The Apple TV+ lineup remained strong, and the sports win is important for Apple, especially in light of Vision Pro. I have some concerns around Apple Card and savings as Apple looks for a new partner. Matt Deatherage: Barely noticed any improvements, didn’t notice any regressions. Chance Miller: The prices for all of Apple’s services remained the same in 2024 while the quality of each continued to improve. Apple Arcade continues to be underrated, and I’ve found myself opening Apple News on a surprisingly regular basis. In particular, the election coverage in the Apple News app was top-notch. Apple Music excels in a world where Spotify continues to combine music, podcasts, videos, and other junk into a single interface. Kirk McElhearn: Still only 5GB based storage for iCloud, which means a lot of people don’t back up their iPhones. This is unconscionable these days and borders on forced bundling, requiring users to pay for extra storage. Even if it’s only a dollar a month, the mere fact that users have to enter into a regular transaction with Apple seems monopolistic. There should be options to use other services to back up the device. I have the basic Apple One subscription, and it only comes with 50 GB of storage, so I have to pay another $3 a month to get enough. This all feels like Apple is nickel and diming people. Matt Birchler: Much like the home category, I am struggling to think of anything notable Apple did in services this year, and I guess I think they’re mostly fine. Steven Aquino: I wish Apple would revisit the Apple TV branding to make it clearer. There’s the box and the streaming service, but I’d bet most people associate “Apple TV” with TV+ instead of the box. The TV app adds more complexity and confusion in terms of naming. Brent Simmons: Most of the services I’ve tried work okay, but I’m annoyed by all the advertising for them. Paul Kafasis: I think Apple is spread too thin, and a whole lot of these items are distractions that aren’t worth their time. Lex Friedman: Apple TV+ and Apple Music remain very good. Apple Fitness and Apple News remain fine. Apple Pay is wonderful. iCloud storage is still an issue in 2025. C’mon, Apple. David Sparks: I understand how important services are to Apple and Wall Street. I simultaneously fear how much building services revenue now enters the equation for new products. Also, the free iCloud tear of 5GB was first announced in 2011. That was 14 years ago. As a point of reference, the human genome project took 13 years. Dan Moren: I use almost all of Apple’s services, and they are fine. But very few of them make me want to stand up and cheer. It’s eye-rolling that the company still hasn’t upgraded that 5GB base iCloud tier. Myke Hurley: The content! It continues to be great. There are always Apple TV+ shows in my favorites of the year, and this one was no different. Slow Horses, Bad Monkey. Great work. Benjamin Mayo: Apple didn’t make a big deal about the personalized ‘New’ tab in Apple Music, but it makes a big difference. The app feels a lot more vibrant and alive, with rolling recommendations and suggestions relevant to individual music tastes. It filled a big gap in the Apple Music offering. Philip Michaels: If Apple silicon was the smartest move Apple did in years, then setting up a bunch of services with recurring revenue that tapped into all those installed devices was the second smartest Jessica Dennis: I still love a fair amount of Apple TV+ content, and sometimes Apple News+ comes in handy. I’m an Apple One Premier subscriber, and luckily for Apple, I have not sat down to do the math and come to the conclusion that it’s probably not really worth it for me. Shelly Brisbin: Apple offers enough services now that it’s hard to craft an overall narrative. Some, like Apple Music and iCloud, are great. Apple News+, which I want to love because I believe in a news environment where multiple platforms and ways of staying informed can thrive, hasn’t taken hold or made a compelling case for its own unique value. Also, on the negative side of the ledger, a recent issue with a subscription purchased through TV+ left me stuck in a limbo of automated prompts, with no easy way to contact a human. This is an issue plenty of people face, but Apple tends to get more of a pass than other companies, it seems to me. There’s no Genius Bar for services issues. Rich Mogull: We are an Apple One family. The storage expansion solved my biggest gripe. News is my go-to news app, and across the family, we make heavy use of all of the services except Apple Arcade. The privacy features of iCloud, like Private Relay and Hide My Email, are underrated. Passwords and Keychain sync are borderline disruptive. Marco Arment: Apple TV+ is the flashy star of the services, reliably delivering great new shows and seasons. iCloud and the service infrastructure remain the quiet heroes, working reliably behind the scenes to make everything else work so we don’t notice. But a massive chunk of “services” revenue comes from inconvenient truths that Apple wishes we wouldn’t pay attention to. Look at these nice TV shows! Michael Gartenberg: Most services are somewhat stagnant, which is why we see all sorts of bundles that bring services into users’ hands they wouldn’t necessarily buy, like Apple News. I was particularly disappointed that there’s a song on Apple Music called “Let’s Go Bomb Tel-Aviv.” I expect more from Apple. Michael E. Cohen: The plethora of services offered can sometimes be overwhelming to navigate or even understand. That said, I have had little problem accessing and using many of them. Roman Loyola: I guess I should stop waiting for Apple to increase the free base storage amount. Stephen Hackett: All in all, Apple is doing a good job with its various Services. TV+ is home to some of the best storytelling, and Fitness+ is inspiring and fun. iCloud syncs data more reliably than ever. Apple Arcade has become home to many rebooted classic iOS games, while Apple Podcasts has made the industry more accessible than ever. There are still sore spots, but none of them are new. iCloud’s storage tiers are stingy and oddly spaced out, and the ads in News+ continue to spoil an otherwise solid experience. Charles Arthur: TV+ has been disappointing. Slow Horses is the standout series. Most else is indifferent and uninteresting. Glenn Fleishman: Everything worked for me this year! Christina Warren: My continued line about Apple Services is that they are not best in class in any area. But the ubiquity and the way they work with Apple products keeps me paying. But in my mind, there isn’t an Apple service that is best in class in any way, and what I ultimately pay for is the convenience. I will give the new Passwords app a shoutout because I think it can replace a 1Password or Bitwarden or LastPass subscription for many families. I still pay for 1Password, and I’ll continue to, but for most people in the Apple ecosystem, I think Passwords is good enough. So that’s a bright spot. Everything else. Meh. It’s fine. But I wouldn’t call any of them best in class. Andrew Laurence: In the name of all that is holy, Siri and Apple Music’s default for “play this song” to be the most recent release version in my library needs to be stopped. If I say, “Play the song Born to Run,” the original 1975 release is the only correct answer. John Siracusa: Apple really needs to give some attention to the client apps for its “lesser” services on its “lesser” platforms. The Music app on macOS is in desperate need of some love, and iCloud Drive in the Finder is still maddeningly inconsistent and buggy. Howard Oakley: Apple’s ‘curating’ of the App Store remains lamentably poor and isn’t improving. John Gruber: TV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I’d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content. Movies are still a weakness: “Wolfs” should have been great but was mediocre and forgettable. And that was TV+’s best movie of the year. But TV+ series continue to excel: Slow Horses had another crackerjack season, For All Mankind finished a good fourth season, and new shows like Dark Matter, Bad Monkey, and Presumed Innocent were all strong. TV+ is also a great streaming platform for small kids. iCloud, especially with iCloud Plus, remains secure, fast, and reliable. It enables so much seamless continuity (hence Apple’s “Continuity” umbrella brand for those features) across devices. But here we are again, with me repeating the same gripe from previous years: it’s miserly that Apple is still offering only a mere 5 GB of storage at the free tier and has left the paid-tier storage allotments unchanged forever. I wonder how many zillions of iPhone users out there don’t have device backups because they only have a free iCloud account with 5 GB? The Apple One bundle is a good deal, but the free iCloud tier should be genuinely useful for backing up a modern iPhone. And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do. Brett Terpstra: I really enjoy Apple TV+ shows, but I have moved away from Apple for news and music. There are just better services out there. I appreciate Apple Pay and my Apple Card, but the only changes in that area this year that I know of were APY decreases on Savings accounts. James Thomson: AppleTV+ programming continued to be a highlight in an otherwise lackluster—or, at best, stagnant—set of service offerings. Allison Sheridan: Apple TV+ is knocking it out of the park on show content. Developers can now confidently include iCloud syncing in their apps, making a seamless and delightful experience for users. Fitness+ continues to add new workouts, and the interface improvements make it easier to get to your saved workouts. Casey Liss: We. Still. Get. 5GB. Of. Storage. For. Free. On. iCloud. Apple services are mostly good on the surface. Fitness+ is great, although (like the Vision Pro) I wish more content got added more frequently. Apple TV+ continues to fire on all cylinders — as I write this, I just finished Shrinking season 2, and I am counting the days to Severance season 2. Apple Music is pretty good, but annoying issues with the app on all platforms wear me down. Any time music just doesn’t play — without any sort of error messaging, naturally — I get just a bit more frustrated. Thankfully, Spotify has worked hard to enshittify their app recently, so I am not feeling the longing I once did for a return to the land of the green and black. I know services are printing money for Apple, but the value for money for consumers is bad and getting worse. We should have had more iCloud storage years ago — especially at lower tiers. Every time I see a NEARLY FORTY DOLLAR bill for AppleOne, I die a little inside. Which means I’m dying a little inside twelve times a year. Nick Heer: As Apple’s services business grows, it begins to do things that feel uncharacteristic but are increasingly commonplace. Partnering with Taboola is one example. Flaky client software is another. Also, remember how lots of people were locked out of their Apple IDs in April, and we still have no idea why? Dr. Drang: I’ve been very pleased with Fitness+, which surprised me. I do wish it would get smarter about the kinds of workouts I tend to use and stop showing me stuff I don’t care about. I guess I should bite the bullet and build up a library so I don’t have to hunt. Rosemary Orchard: Puzzles, etc., are still not available outside of America!!! Quinn Nelson: Apple TV+ continues to stand out as the shining beacon of excellence in an otherwise neglected lineup of services. Federico Viticci: I switched from Apple Music to Spotify last year, so the only Apple services we use in our household now are iCloud storage with family sharing and Apple TV+. I love Apple TV+, but they should make a native app for Android so that I can watch their TV shows on my Lenovo media tablet. As for iCloud, I use it for Shortcuts, app integrations, and basic iCloud Drive storage, but I don’t trust it for work-related assets because it’s so damn slow. For whatever reason, with Dropbox, I can upload heavy video files in seconds, thanks to my fiber connection, but with iCloud, I have to wait a full day for those assets to sync across devices. iCloud Drive needs more controls and tools for people who work with files and share them with other people. How would you rate the overall reliability of Apple’s hardware in 2024? Were things better, worse, or pretty much the same in terms of the hardware working the way you expected? Were there issues? Consider anything you deem appropriate. Benjamin Mayo: Stellar year as far as reliability goes. I can’t recall any scandal at all, which is perhaps a first. Matt Birchler: It’s amazing how reliable and consistent Apple hardware is. The iPhone, especially, is made at a scale where basically no other product in the world matches, and it still releases on time and at very high quality without fail. Paul Kafasis: Apple hardware has been great for me. Marco Arment: We live in a golden era of Apple hardware reliability that’s so good that it’s easily taken for granted. No other consumer tech company executes at this level of hardware reliability. Chance Miller: Another year without any major complaints in this category is a victory for everyone. Rob Griffiths: Despite the foibles with software, I’ve only had one hardware problem in recent memory (a new Studio had a bad motherboard). Michael Tsai: My most recent hardware has been working well this year. My 2019 Intel MacBook Pro’s internal SSD partially failed. The Mac is out of AppleCare, and the SSD is non-replaceable, so now it can only be used with an external SSD, which is inconvenient for a portable computer and somewhat unreliable (with sleep, etc.). This would be worse with an Apple Silicon–based MacBook Pro because, for security reasons, they no longer support booting from external storage when the internal storage isn’t working. Without being able to replace the SSD, the whole Mac would be dead. Kirk McElhearn: I haven’t had any hardware issues on any of my Apple devices this year. Dan Moren: Hardware reliability has been solid for the last few years. I can’t remember the last time I had a hardware problem that was not caused by actual damage. (Sorry, MacBook Air screen.) Jessica Dennis: All my Apple hardware has been pretty much rock solid. Howard Oakley: Hardware problems remain surprisingly uncommon, as far as I’m aware. Christina Warren: I got my mom a 16GB M3 MacBook Air for Christmas, replacing a 2018 Retina MacBook Air — a laptop that, in 2018, had 8GB of RAM and that I paid extra to get it with 256GB SSD. Her new model fortunately got the Apple Intelligence-led RAM upgrade, even if 256GB of base storage is abhorrent in 2024. Anyway, the reason I mention this is that I was reminded of just how bad Apple’s laptops were 6 years ago. Butterfly keyboards. Chips that required loud fans to cool if they were in thin chassis. Performance that frankly peaked in 2015. I spent $1400 on that 2018 MacBook Air and it was never a good performer (we didn’t have any reliability issues except for a minor hiccup last year that made me learn the ridiculous requirements for rescuing a Mac that won’t boot post macOS 11) and I’ve felt angry about that basically the whole time she owned it. When the MBA got a RAM upgrade and Best Buy had a loss-leader price for Black Friday, I jumped at the chance to upgrade her and I feel like this is going to be an excellent laptop. It’s really a testament to the work Apple has done since 2020 or 2021 to re-earn their trust, at least as far as laptops go. My iPads, iPhones, AirPods, Apple Watches, and other devices have all had a good year as far as reliability goes. Federico Viticci: I have never had an Apple product fail on me, hardware-wise, in the 16 years I’ve been covering the company. If there’s one area where Apple is leagues ahead of its competition, I think it’s hardware manufacturing and overall experience. John Gruber: No news remains great news in this category. Stephen Hackett: Apple has long been a leader in hardware reliability. Now, with the company publishing repair guides and making parts available to end-users and small shops, users have more options than ever when something goes wrong. Carolina Milanesi: I have had some issues with the iPhone and AirPods, but nothing critical. Michael E. Cohen: None of my many Apple devices had reliability issues this year. Brian Mattucci: Touch ID is still mostly a miss for me on the Mac, even after upgrading to the USB-C keyboard. How would you rate the overall quality of Apple’s operating system software in 2024? Were things better, worse, or pretty much the same in terms of the operating systems working as expected? Where there issues? How would you rate the overall quality of Apple’s apps, including bundled apps and apps it sells separately, in 2024? Consider anything you deem appropriate. John Siracusa: Apple really needs to shift the balance between new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Today’s Apple vastly undervalues the process of “polishing” existing features. There needs to be way, way more of it, especially on macOS. Craig Hockenberry: I never tell my wife about upcoming changes in Apple software. I’ve found it’s a good way to get an unfiltered opinion about new things, both good and bad. Let’s just say there was a string of expletives regarding the changes to Photos on iOS. I’m seeing a trend towards complexity in Apple software. The recent changes in Mail categorization made no sense to me—and they were enabled by default! I had a similar reaction to Focus modes, but at least that wasn’t forced upon me. It feels like the designers and developers at Apple know their products too well. I’m sure a lot of these changes feel important to the folks working on them, but to someone who’s not following the products so closely, it’s just a series of confounding hurdles. Dave Hamilton: I wish Apple would focus more on reliability and less on changing features that have just been integrated into our workflows. I appreciate that they don’t want to stagnate, but wholesale changes to what might seem like minor features (I’m looking at you, Safari’s “Add to Dock” functionality) can be massively disruptive to one’s workflow. Brett Terpstra: I love Sequoia. It doesn’t have groundbreaking features, but it was a painless upgrade that broke very few apps, and the minor improvements have been really nice. It’s kind of the same story on iOS. It’s nothing to write home about, but it’s reliable and has appreciated touches. Dan Moren: Apple Intelligence: There’s a weird sort of reality distortion field operating here. Never has Apple spent more time on features that seem important strategically but actually feel mostly like things people don’t care about or won’t use. I’m not a generative AI naysayer, but Apple’s features here are uninspiring and lackluster. The biggest thing they rolled out on this front was Private Cloud Compute which is truly impressive technology with, so far, very little to merit its use. Chance Miller: Apple lowered the bar for software quality in its race to ship Apple Intelligence features. There are genuinely useful Apple Intelligence features, like in-line summaries in the Mail app, but botched features like notification summaries are a plague on the overall experience. The new icon tinting and Home Screen customization options in iOS 18 are great. It’s easy to dunk on some of the uglier creations on social media, but I’m glad Apple has removed the guardrails to let people do what they want with their phones. Joe Rosensteel: Apple has been slipping on software quality for a while, but with the focus on Apple Intelligence, the quality control has really suffered. We can’t even point to Apple Intelligence and say, “It was all worth it so we could have this” because all the Apple Intelligence software isn’t just buggy but poorly conceived from the outset. Casey Liss: Literally the same thing I wrote about software reliability in 2023: New shiny continues to trump reliability. It’s not awful, but it’s not great. Same as it ever was. New this year, Apple Intelligence and Image Playgrounds are mostly a dud. It was clearly a feature done while Apple was on its heels — a way to say, “We can do that too! Look!” I actually mostly like the notification summaries, but every time I try to have fun with Image Playground, it ends up being a frustrating failure. Myke Hurley: Apple Intelligence has been a thorn in the side this year. There are features that I do like, but the overall sentiment is not good for many valid reasons. I like Notification Summaries, but I know they are okay at best. For me, though, Image Playground was a mistake. They should have been able to see this, and it should not have shipped. It’s a bad version of something that isn’t great to begin with. Michael Tsai: The software quality slide continues. The same old bugs are still there. Finder views still don’t update or reveal properly, and external drives still don’t mount reliably. macOS Sequoia brought new problems, particularly related to storage. Now, it’s sometimes impossible to unmount drives cleanly. Time Machine deleted lots of my old backups unnecessarily and had trouble completing new backups. Third-party backup utilities are also having trouble, as Sequoia broke ASR’s ability to create bootable backups. Multiple of my Macs now have regular kernel panics, which never happened before. There are a variety of new networking issues. Safari often stops working under heavy load, so, though it’s still my default browser, I’m increasingly incorporating Chrome and Firefox. I wish that, instead of focusing on Apple Intelligence, Apple had focused on improving the quality of the OS and on improving the design of Music and the other media/services apps. Rob Griffiths: Both are just sort of “meh.” Nothing earth-shattering, long-standing bugs remain, and the Mac continues its horrendous slide toward the iOS UI. Howard Oakley: Although OS and apps have been generally good, there have been some moments, such as the serious bugs in macOS 15.0 that had to be corrected early and the failure to progress other apps. Perhaps most disappointing is Apple’s lack of insight into what’s important to users: for example, macOS virtualization on Apple silicon continues to omit any support for App Store apps. While I understand the internal conflicts behind that (over authorization), I find it hard to believe that Apple wasn’t aware of them before it even launched virtualization. Yet, after enabling iCloud access in Sequoia, it has still not done anything about enabling App Store apps, which greatly reduces the value of virtualization for many. Paul Kafasis: As I said, can Apple get off the annual OS update cycle yet? Given the new features in .x releases in the past couple of years, it’s clear that even they don’t believe in it at present. We don’t need new OSes every year, and Apple can’t actually provide them every 12 months. Slow it down—it’s really OK. David Sparks: I continue to be impressed by Apple’s Productivity suite with annual solid, updates. I’m reserving judgment on Apple Intelligence until we see more. Rich Mogull: I have a lot of devices, and they have all been quite stable. Andrew Laurence: The Apple Intelligence rollout has been a FOMO-fueled own goal. The incremental feature rollout belies the aggressive advertising, the hoisted petard of notification summaries, the doesn’t-pass-the-red-face “beta” excuse, and the unknown timeline of fulfilling the 2024 WWDC announcements. As I type this, the lying eyes of Apple Intelligence news summaries are reaching the mockery strata once held by Newton poetry. Brent Simmons: Hardware quality is far ahead of software quality. Rosemary Orchard: I wish Apple would not push beta features like Apple Intelligence on everyone. My parents had it without me setting it up and were asking me if they needed a ChatGPT subscription for better Siri! Christina Warren: Putting the Apple Intelligence of it all aside — I think this was a decent year for Apple’s main platforms. Are there some regressions and annoyances in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia? Absolutely. Nick Heer: Apple’s computers are lots of things, but, ultimately, they are tools. I would like them to feel more confidence-inspiring. Apple Intelligence flaws are surely going to show up several times here. Setting that aside, I find plenty of bugs in Apple’s operating system, even in core features like window management. There was a wild layout bug in iOS 18’s Now Playing widget that shipped in public versions for two subsequent versions. I feel like there was a time when that would be more embarrassing. Nearly everyone I know was, at some point this year, prompted to use Check In and share their location with their parents; none of us live with our parents. Bugs aside, the introduction of yet more nagging security alerts in MacOS Sequoia continues an unwanted trend. My problematic opinion of the year is that I really like the new Photos app on iOS 18. Also, the new Mail app on iOS. I continue to ask whomever at Apple is available to please fix the Music app on MacOS. Benjamin Mayo: This year’s Sports app is entirely new, and I think it takes a pretty novel approach to a sports scores interface. The Live Activities on iPhone and Watch highlight the best of Apple ecosystem integration. Adam Engst: Apple Intelligence is disappointing, particularly given how much Apple has promoted it. If anything, Siri seems to be getting worse instead of better. Kirk McElhearn: Please, Apple, take a year off from flooding us with new features and fix bugs across all the operating systems. I’m tired of spending time troubleshooting tiny problems. And AppleCare support for this sort of thing has gotten abysmal in recent years. While I didn’t have any such issues this year, over the past few years, I’ve had numerous cases with AppleCare which were escalated to senior advisors, who told me that they would “take ownership of my case” and from whom I never heard back, even after emailing several times. There seems to be little accountability with AppleCare anymore. Quinn Nelson: OS updates are typically accompanied by new features—not the promise of new features. Allison Sheridan: Purely from my perspective, macOS Sequoia seems quite a bit more fiddly than previous OSes. Apps crashing, annoying popups about apps wanting local network access, and, of course, the bug in ASR come to mind. That said, I continue to be delighted with the features of Continuity. Features like having all devices share a clipboard, using a phone to scan a document directly into Finder, or being used as a camera are things I haven’t yet begun to take for granted. Stephen Hackett: Even with the addition of visionOS, Apple was able to move the ball forward across most of its ecosystem in 2024. Apple continues to ship features simultaneously across the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. Bugs remain, of course, but it’s been a long time since I’ve spent an afternoon troubleshooting something. Starting with the relaunch of Notes in the iOS 9/OS X El Capitan days, Apple has worked consistently on growing its first-party productivity apps into tools that more and more people can rely on at work. Reminders has gone from some sort of digital Hipster PDA with its card-based UI to a full-blown task manager, complete with robust sharing, a Kanban view, and integration with Calendar. Freeform came out of nowhere to take on some serious contenders from third-party developers. Safari is the true favorite child, with features added every cycle. Photos has become robust and even more useful with the launch of family sharing a couple of years ago. My biggest complaint is the lack of consistency across Apple’s apps. Look no further than Apple’s tools for smart searching. Editing a smart list in Reminders is weirdly different than creating a new smart folder in Mail or Notes, and on iOS in particular, Apple teams seem to be working from different guidelines when it comes to design elements. The new Sports app and Journal use gradients and color in fun ways, while much of iOS is still starkly white and blue. Messages is a hodgepodge of ancient message effects and fun, new text effects that operate in different ways in different parts of the app. It’s time for some UI cleanup across the board, even if that makes the Mac user in me a little nervous that the disease that is System Settings would spread. Jessica Dennis: The Apple Intelligence stuff is just so underwhelming so far. I wanted Image Playground to be like Google’s Emoji Kitchen, and it’s really, really not. Image Playground does both more and less than what I want — I want a crying cactus, which is a mashup of the crying and cactus emojis, and instead, I get a standard boring AI-generated image that looks like all the rest of the AI “art” (let’s not even go there) these days. John Gruber: Unchanged comment and grade from a year ago: I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple’s software design is headed (or, in some ways, has been now for years), but their software reliability has been very good for me. Michael E. Cohen: Stuff mostly works. But nothing’s perfect. Matt Deatherage: Apple Intelligence to date not only doesn’t live up to its potential, it doesn’t live up to the commercials Apple has aired. Dr. Drang: Apple Intelligence has really hurt Apple’s reputation on both the oversell and underdeliver sides. They advertised features well before they were available, and then when the features arrived, they didn’t have all their parts—a complete inversion of the “old Apple.” Matt Birchler: I think Apple Intelligence is a mess right now, but the rest of Apple’s operating systems are in pretty good shape, in my view. More updates to iPadOS and tvOS would be great, and parts of Apple’s apps (mostly Shortcuts) can be buggy, but I still use Apple’s platforms and am confident they’re the best ones for me compared to the competition. Lex Friedman: Image Playground is stupid. How would you rate the overall relationship between Apple and its third-party developers this year? Consider anything you deem appropriate. Casey Liss: Lol. I would give this a -5 if I could. Apple’s monopolistic behavior continues unabated — despite the EU’s efforts to… uh… abate it. Apple completely thumbing its nose at the spirit of the new rules, knowing full well how wrong it is, is deplorable. Even though I don’t concur with many of the EU’s rulings, Apple basically saying, “screw you, I’ll do what I want,” is incredibly off-putting. On a happier, if more schadenfreude-y note, it’s been hilarious watching the Vision Pro App Store colossally fail. Developers have been treated like shit by Apple for the better part of a decade, and Apple is now reaping what it sows. Why would developers do Apple a solid and go on faith this [potentially DOA] platform is going to be worth our time and efforts when everywhere we turn, they’re giving us the middle finger? I did the bare minimum for Callsheet, and I almost regret doing that much. Developer documentation remains a perennial yet solvable problem. It has absolutely gotten better, but it’s still really bad. Andy Ihnatko: 2024 was just a typical year in which Apple expected developers to be grateful for the lavish bounty that the company has so generously provided them and not make trouble. If Apple treated all of its customers the same way they treated developers — who are also Apple customers — we’d all still be waiting for cut copy and paste on the iPhone. Chance Miller: I don’t think developers embraced Apple Vision Pro with open arms like Apple had anticipated they would. Whether that’s because it’s a niche product or strained developer relations, I’m not sure. Probably a little bit of both. If Apple wants Vision Pro to mature, this is something that needs to be addressed. Dan Moren: Apple’s pushback to the DMA is perhaps understandable from a business perspective, but it makes the company look petty and recalcitrant. There’s a decided sense that Apple doesn’t know which way the wind is blowing as regards people’s opinions of Big Tech companies. John Siracusa: Apple’s continued resistance to the avalanche of new regional regulations being forced upon it is not serving the company well. At a certain point, it behooves Apple to embrace the changes and enthusiastically forge a new, more open path across all markets rather than wasting time and energy fragmenting its products and making things as difficult as possible for everyone involved. Matt Birchler: Early 2024 was all about Apple fighting the U.S. and EU at every turn to not give up any of the restrictive rules they’ve set around monetizing every cent they can remotely justify. I think Apple’s developers and product people love third party devs, but the business people seem to only think those devs should be thankful Apple permits them at all to work on Apple platforms. Marco Arment: Developer relations remain needlessly strained. Antagonistic positions and greedy policies from Apple’s executives continue to burn developer goodwill, trust, and enthusiasm that the developer-relations team is trying their hardest to retain, but there’s only so much they can do. Christina Warren: I was going to give this a three but the more I think about it, I really do think this is an area Apple most desperately needs to have some internal “come to Jesus” discussions. The utter failure of the Vision Pro from a developer perspective, coupled with the drama around not just emulators but also the DMA and alt-app stores, shows that the tension between Apple and their platform devs is in as precarious of a place as I can recall seeing it. To be clear, devs are still building amazing apps for all Apple platforms, and I think Apple platforms have the best software in the world (games notwithstanding), but the ability for developers to make a living off that software gets more difficult all the time. And decisions around areas like In App Purchase and subscriptions for content that should never have a 30% fee associated with Apple (for things like Patreon) feel beyond capricious. I’m glad for apps like Delta and third-party app stores that finally allowed emulators in the proper App Store, but the continuous problems emulator devs have getting their apps and updates into the store continue to be frustrating. Jason said it best when he wrote, “the App Store era must end,” and I co-sign that entire essay. (I wish I had written it; amazing job, Jason.) I’m putting this under developer relations because I really do see this as a developer relations problem. Vision Pro, even more than Apple Watch, shows that developers aren’t just going to show up and build apps for Apple’s new platforms anymore. And I can’t blame them. Nick Heer: What made me score this lower is Apple’s attitude toward regulators generally. I empathize with the company’s reluctance to make changes demanded by what it surely sees as meddling bureaucrats. But it has been obstinate in ways I think are counterproductive for everyone. For example, despite requirements to change its anti-steering measures in one jurisdiction after another, it is holding onto those policies everywhere else. In the European Union, its compliance measures have turned Apple into its own worst enemy. Craig Hockenberry: Apple is blowing it with developers. Full stop. Look at the general ambivalence towards Vision Pro as a manifestation of this – a new platform needs developers who are excited and ready to explore a product’s capabilities. This did not happen with the headset. It’s a cumulative thing: a lot of folks went into iPad development with the same enthusiasm they had for the iPhone. Then, they realized that supporting the device was a lot of extra work without a lot of extra revenue. Then Apple Watch came along… same thing. You now have a situation where developers are leery of a new platform. Now, throw in some unsavory maneuvers to avoid regulations that let developers choose their path with customers. The new App Store structures are designed by lawyers and accountants, not folks who create software. It’s no surprise to me that all the developers I know have a growing distrust of Apple. Apple is doing a lot of taking these days and not giving back to the developer community that has helped make its products thrive. Carolina Milanesi: I feel the negativity of previous years has dissipated somewhat Alex Cox: I have nothing constructive—I just don’t like watching friends getting fucked over for making things people love. Benjamin Mayo: They might be doing it by kicking and screaming, but the regulatory pressure is improving the developer ecosystem. For example, retro game emulators like Delta are now available worldwide on the App Store! Michael Tsai: The same old issues with the App Store, documentation, and bug reporting. Nothing seems to be getting better. This was the second year in a row that Xcode shipped with a showstopper bug for Mac developers. Once again, it was reported during the beta period, but there was no urgency to fix it. The Swift toolchain is still crashy and unreliable. Apple continues to write SwiftUI and SwiftData checks that the frameworks can’t cash. James Thomson: Apple continued its numerous legal battles with countries around the world to extract its cut of developer sales. It was forced to allow third-party App Stores in the EU, but then used supposedly neutral tools like notarization as de facto App Review, the Core Technology Fee, and surrounding rules to deliberately make them as unappealing as possible to developers. Apple should compete on merit, not threats. Charles Arthur: Vision Pro. EU DMA and the wrangles over third-party app stores. Enough said. John Gruber: Fourth year in a row with basically the same comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. Apple’s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers look for excuses to create software exclusively for Apple’s platforms. The opposite is happening. The big change globally this year is the Digital Markets Act going into effect in the EU. I stand apart from many in the Cupertino punditry racket in applauding Apple for its compliance efforts. I think it has complied with a terrible law as best it can while protecting its own vision for how its platforms should be designed and work. (And, of course, protecting its own vision for how it should be able to monetize those platforms.) But even I — a guy who thinks Apple has done a remarkable job shipping an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the DMA — can’t and won’t argue that any of Apple’s efforts on the DMA front have repaired or improved its relationship with third-party developers. Despite the situation being largely unchanged, I’ve adjusted my grade on this subject from C to D this year because stagnation is catching up to Apple. More of the same is making matters worse. And I think we saw that with the relative dearth of native app support for Vision Pro. There’s a chicken-and-egg problem with a new platform like VisionOS. The best way to generate developer interest in a new platform is to sell a lot of units to a lot of users who are looking for apps to use and games to play. But the best way to sell a lot of hardware units to a lot of users is to have a deep exclusive-to-the-platform ecosystem of both first- and third-party apps and games. With previous new developer platforms, like iOS and Mac OS X, Apple powered through this initial conundrum by attracting developers who just wanted to create awesome new software for an awesome new platform. That enthusiasm was tempered greatly last year for VisionOS, and I think it was a lot more about how developers feel about Apple and the App Store than how they feel about Vision Pro itself. Howard Oakley: I’ve had no problems, but the App Store and its review process never fail to shock and disappoint. Rosemary Orchard: They have removed the limited number of requests for each developer (company) per year; however, there are still a large number of APIs without adequate documentation. (One line!!) Paul Kafasis: Sadly, Apple has been absolutely torching developer goodwill for several years now. App Store policies have not improved. Its malicious compliance with EU laws has been terribly disappointing to see. It knows what’s right, and refuses to do it, because it wants to protect every possible revenue source it has. It doesn’t have to be this way. How much is enough? At what point can a company say “We’ve won, we’re going to do what’s right, not what’s most profitable for the next quarter”? Sadly, probably never. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues in most of the world, and where it doesn’t, Apple is still an enormous prick. This shocking level of greed — combined with its obsequious behavior toward the incoming administration — is burning right through the remaining developer goodwill. Myke Hurley: Easily one of the worst years I have seen from them in a long, long time. And it’s all down to the DMA. Apple’s response to legislation is ridiculous. Using notarization as a way to stop apps from existing, the Core Technology Fee, and countless more dark spots. They should never have gotten to this step, and now they’re here I wish they would give a little more than they are. Apple executives claim that the company wants to leave the world a better place, and the company champions numerous causes. How well does Apple live up to its own standards in 2024? Consider anything you deem appropriate, including education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple’s work force, and other political and policy stances. John Siracusa: While Tim Cook’s donation to Trump may benefit Apple, its employees, and even its customers, it certainly won’t have a positive social impact. Joe Rosensteel: I’m of two minds when it comes to Apple’s green initiatives. I think they’re great, but they do design systems where the whole thing has to be recycled instead of upgraded or easily repaired. I believe political and policy stances are really where Apple fell short in 2024. Notably with the European Commission and the trials involving the justice department. Like when we all found out how many billion dollars Google pays Apple to be the default search engine. At present, I can’t say I’m optimistic about the direction things are heading in terms of other political and policy decisions. Jessica Dennis: For a company that pays so much lip service to being green, using so much energy on very underwhelming AI stuff is very hmmmmm. And then, of course, there’s the million bucks Tim Cook sent to the incoming president — I guess he probably had to For Business Reasons, but it’s still gross, and I hate it. John Gruber: Apple’s efforts on the environmental front continue to strike me as extraordinary. Their accessibility features are so far ahead of the rest of the industry that I don’t even know who’s in second place. On social issues, by staying true to its longstanding, humane, common sense values, Apple’s culture has seemingly remained utterly consistent through a series of tumultuous years in our society at large, during which other companies have ping-ponged first sharply left, and now sharply right. If I stopped there, that would make for an obvious A grade. But: politics. I understand (I think) Tim Cook’s thinking and approach. I wouldn’t want his job, and I genuinely wonder at times who would. Sing-song congratulatory tweets leave a bitter taste, but I’m amenable to the argument that CEOs must play the cards they’ve been dealt, not the cards they’d hoped for. If you have to serve shit sandwiches, serve shit sandwiches — but don’t tell us they taste like pumpkin pie. Tim Cook can’t donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration slush fund when Apple donated a mere $43,200 thousand to Biden’s and expect us to do anything but laugh at the supposed justification that Cook “believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity.” That’s Tim Cook’s hoagie-sized shit sandwich to eat, and it’s disrespectful to pitch us on taking a few bites ourselves to help him get through it. I genuinely believe Cook is doing what’s best for Apple, and that’s quite literally his job. But it was true during the first Trump administration, and already is again in the second, that what’s best for Apple politically is in conflict with what’s best for the country and for the world. Brent Simmons: Seeking favor with fascists not only helps the fascists — it harms the world. Steven Aquino: From an accessibility standpoint, the AirPods Pro hearing aid feature has to exemplify Apple’s ethos of making the world a better place. It isn’t perfect, but the salient point is it’s tremendously significant the functionality exists at all. And it doesn’t take into account the continued work Apple did in 2024 to make its devices more accessible to the disability community. As I always say, Apple deserves more laudation in this realm than “gee whiz.” James Thomson: The push to ship Apple Intelligence has sacrificed a lot of Apple’s engineering focus and moral high ground in the name of boosting the stock price. Aside from many of the features not being in a functional state that should have been shipped to billions of people, Apple had a chance to lead the industry in terms of ethical training data and chose not to, damaging its relationship with the creative professionals who have traditionally been their biggest supporters. And in the end most people do not care about the actual functionality. But hey, the stock price went up. Marco Arment: Apple’s environmental work is very strong and commendable, but their continued strong presence in and reliance on China remains damaging and strategically limiting, and their explicit support and significant funding of the incoming Trump administration is opportunistic, dangerous, appalling, and spineless. Howard Oakley: Apple continues to champion several important issues, including the environment and privacy. However, there have been a succession of less glorious moments regarding the latter and a continuing lack of transparency. Lex Friedman: I continue to be disappointed by Tim Cook’s kowtowing to Trump. Alex Cox: Apple does exceed the on-the-ground bar that is “better than Meta,” but every year, they seem a little closer to the floor. Aside from all the political antics that the biggest companies in America all but “have” to do, I was most disappointed that there was no mention of how Apple Intelligence will impact their environmental goals. Most data on AI efficiency is all over the place, and I thought they’d have at least some information based on their on-device strategies. I’m no EACC bro, but as someone relatively excited about most LLM developments, it was disappointing that not even Apple felt they could address their energy use. Allison Sheridan: I was incredibly dismayed that Apple forced all AI developers from San Diego to move to Texas. Imagine being a woman of child-bearing age working in California and having to choose between your career and your health. I was disturbed enough by this to write to Tim Cook to explain what a horrific choice he had made. Zac Hall: Sometimes Apple reminds you that it is a corporation. Andy Ihnatko: Normally a solid 4, I’m docking a point this year. Apple’s Intelligence isn’t going to inflict the same degree of damage on the planet as Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft’s AI efforts. However, Apple utilizes those same AI foundries to build and train its models, so they aren’t entirely free of responsibility. I hope Apple’s 2025 Environmental Progress Report is transparent about the impact Apple creates as an AI customer. Rich Mogull: A 5 for general privacy, especially Advanced Data Protection and their partnering with Citizens Lab. 5 for environmental impact. A 1 for Tim Cook bowing to Trump. A 2 for their soft gloves with China. Shelly Brisbin: I’ll say here, as I always do, that accessibility, in particular, should be evaluated in terms of technology, utility, and effectiveness at making platforms and software available to all. It’s not about virtue signaling or even being nice for its own sake. So here goes: Apple had a good year when it comes to accessibility. That’s especially noteworthy in the Vision Pro’s varied and clever ways of providing access to a platform whose typical operation relies heavily on the use of eyes and hands. The company continues to tweak deep accessibility features, like this year’s Braille Screen Input updates. And AirPods Pro’s embrace of its identity as an over-the-counter hearing aid should give both users and accessibility advocates within Apple a lot of encouragement to do more. Paul Kafasis: I think Apple used to be better when it comes to global impact. I think they are now too relentlessly focused on squeezing money out of everyone and everything they can, to the detriment of everyone. They’re still better than most companies. They’re still pushing for environmental improvements, diversity, and more. But overall, they just seem much more money-grubbing to me. Brent Simmons’s post on this is worth a link. I think of it often. Dr. Drang: Did Tim Cook give more money to the Trump inauguration than to victims of the L.A. fires? Matt Birchler: I think it’s an overall win, although I don’t like how they treat software developers. It will be interesting to see how they play with the new U.S. administration. Christina Warren: I’ll be the jerk that says it: I miss the stickers, and I don’t think it was worth the so-called environmental impact. I am glad that FineWoven was killed (and sorry, but you’ll never convince me that the plastic they used for FineWoven was any more environmentally sound than just using the mid-quality leather they used before), but I’m equally annoyed the only way to get an official Apple Watch band in leather that isn’t an older model is by going to Hermes. Call me a selfish jerk (or worse), but I don’t think moves like removing stickers, moving to objectively worse materials for cases and watch bands, and forgoing previously included accessories (like wall chargers) — while still selling and trying to bundle said chargers independently — is the best and most effective way to reduce environmental impact. Or, at the very least, these moves feel like ways to cheap out and raise margins but under the guise of doing it for “environmental impact.” I’m glad Apple cares about sustainability; I wish it could care in a way that didn’t feel like they were using it as an excuse to cut corners and niceties. Carolina Milanesi: Apple continues to lead in sustainability, privacy, and the latest stand on not ending DEI programs. Philip Michaels: Given the current state of affairs in our new kleptocracy, I imagine this score will be very different in a year. Glenn Fleishman: I’m not in love with Apple’s current direction. The mandate to return people to the office seems counter to its environmental aims and discriminatory against employees of varying abilities, some of whom relocated. Apple’s adoption of AI, particularly partnering with OpenAI, seems shortsighted without specific plans in mind, given the impact on power usage. Michael Gartenberg: Apple’s impact on the world has gotten the attention of the DOJ and the EU, which is not exactly the impact they might have been aiming for, which is probably why Cook sent a $1 million gift to the new administration’s inauguration, including himself in the pantheon of tech CEOs all under scrutiny and all in attendance in Washington hoping the new administration will let them continue to have the impact on the world as they see fit. Matt Deatherage: if A.I. fits in with Apple’s pledge to be carbon-neutral in five years, they’re not making that well known when a lot of AGI opposition is about how much energy it takes. Casey Liss: Tim Cook donated $1M to Trump’s inauguration. Apple still relies deeply on China. Apple continues to think it operates above the law. Gross. It’s hard to be enthusiastic about Apple when this is how it behaves. Its move toward carbon neutrality is the only thing that kept this from a 1. Peter Cohen: Apple lives up to its standards. Tim’s personal ones left me puzzled. Myke Hurley: Carbon-neutral products are great. I am really happy they are able to do this with more and more. But storm clouds are swirling around: AI, legislation, and more. Apple is too big and too complicated to be a pure good force in the world. Michael E. Cohen: I’d rank this higher, but Cook is attending Trump’s inauguration, so…. Dan Moren: Apple continues to improve its environmental impact, but as with many of the other big tech companies, it’s feeling an inherent tension between reducing its footprint and increasing its reliance on AI, a technology that seems to be extremely energy voracious. I’d like to hear a little more about that when the company announces its next Apple Intelligence features. Nick Heer: This could be an essay. Scratch that — this could be several essays. This year, Apple made a big deal about its repairability and environmental bonafides, but it also continued to fight right-to-repair legislation, and we learned data center emissions are likely many times higher than claimed. Apple made contact sharing more private, but enabled by default a feature to remotely analyze users’ photos. I put my complaints about Apple’s European-centric measures in the Developer section, but they could easily go here, too. Stephen Hackett: The M4 Mac mini is the first carbon-neutral Mac ever made. It comes six years after Apple began using recycled aluminum in its Mac cases. The company continues investing in processes to make our world cleaner. On the social front, things are more complex. Apple continues to support important causes and will continue its DEI efforts, even as other tech companies are rolling them back. However, Tim Cook runs a company with a bigger economic footprint than many countries, and that means that Apple will play ball with the new Trump administration in ways some of its users will find disagreeable. It’s naive to think that a company the size of Apple would do anything else, even if I hope it rubs Tim Cook the wrong way enough to bother him. If you’d like to leave a comment about anything else, leave it below! Alex Cox: I think, finally, people are breaking away from feeling like they need to be a super fan of everything Apple does and every policy it has in order to appreciate the things they still do remarkably well. Eric Linder: This may be a bit meta, but there is something special about Apple that brings about a positive community that is critical at times, but only because of the love of Apple’s platforms and devices. I continue to applaud Apple’s environmental objectives and hope that as they continue to succeed, they really do continue to underpromise and overdeliver, not only with regard to the impact of its products and services but on their positive impact on the world. Andy Ihnatko: FREE CHARLIE BROWN! Howard Oakley: In 2024, the high point has been the release of the Mac mini M4, just months before the mini’s 20th birthday. At a time when Apple looked as if it was becoming obsessed with high-end experiments like Vision Pro, and AI, the redesigned mini is convincing many who have stuck with old Macs running High Sierra and Mojave to take the plunge and upgrade. The spirit of 2005 isn’t dead yet. Chance Miller: Apple’s 2024 leaves us with a lot of unknowns. Will Apple Intelligence live up to the expectations? Will Apple remain committed to Vision Pro? There are looming changes to the App Store in the EU, the DOJ case in the United States, and various other regulatory battles around the world. There’s a lot of uncertainty as we head into the new year, which is rare for a company as established as Apple. Rosemary Orchard: Developer relations are critical, especially with the integration of AI such as ChatGPT as a focus. Extending this to native iOS integrations (Siri intents please!) would be greatly appreciated. Allison Sheridan: It’s such a fun time to be an Apple fangirl. The speed and low power consumption of its laptop lineup are unsurpassed in the industry. Andrew Laurence: Apple’s Enterprise Workflow teams continue to do the Lord’s work. They bridge the gap between a remarkably difficult customer base and internal development priorities in which “the enterprise” is likely an afterthought, if it exists at all. We have become accustomed to new features having little to no available controls, and those that appear seemingly hastily bolted together. Apple is a customer-forward company but has yet to embrace the notion that the end user may not be the customer; that the customer may have primacy over the user, and the user is a risk being managed. Robert Carter: As I blind Apple user, I am pretty happy with the features that Apple added to accessibility this past year. I hope they will continue to use Apple Intelligence to enhance accessibility. Craig Hockenberry: WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET BETTER KEY BOARDS Zac Hall: 2024… not the year that Apple caught up in AI. Marco Arment: Apple Intelligence summary: Hardware is great; developers enjoy TV; missing vertebrae. Charles Arthur: The question I’ve really been asking myself towards the end of the year, and the one I want to ask Tim Cook, is: How would we know if Apple was becoming sclerotic? By which I mean that if the organisation has become unwieldy, unwilling to allow change, incapable of letting good ideas percolate rapidly upwards, how could we tell? We keep hearing and seeing how slow change is: it took an age for accessories to all get USB-C. The AirPods Max and the Pro Display XDR have gone years without being touched. Again and again it feels like it takes forever for even the simplest product upgrades to get out of the door. New ideas like the Vision Pro are hopelessly over-engineered, instead of being designed with a buyer in mind, which reminds me badly of the G4 Cube, which people loved as long as they didn’t own it; if they if did, they discovered the limited memory and some, the manufacturing stress cracks. But at least that Apple saw the problem and moved rapidly: the G4 Cube didn’t survive a year. Now it feels like a bad idea gets polished endlessly until it’s good enough to put out, and then is essentially abandoned. I worry about this. Of course, I might be wrong. But my question remains: how could we tell? What distinguishes a sclerotic Apple from one which is functioning fine, but incredibly deliberately? Kirk McElhearn: I think that 2024 was the year that I finally realized that the Apple of Steve Jobs is truly gone. The Tim Cook bot in interviews and presentations feels like an AI programmed by the marketing department; I get no impression that he really cares about products. At least the pre-recorded product announcements include many more Apple employees, but they all tend to have that same tone. I miss Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller talking about new products with perceivable love for the technology and what it could accomplish. I think Apple is so big right now that they can’t take chances. We grew up with a company that was constantly pushing the envelope, but now, at a time where there aren’t many new hardware features to add to these devices, we have discovered a company that pretends that things are “magical” too often. And you didn’t ask about Apple Intelligence. A half-baked bunch of mainly useless features in an attempt to catch up to a trend that Apple didn’t see coming. None of Apple’s AI features are original, and some, like Image Playground, are just childish. Apple is increasingly out of touch with what people really want to do, it seems, and I don’t see this changing until Tim Cook retires. Federico Viticci: I’m genuinely curious about what Apple is going to do with Apple Intelligence this year. Their first wave of previously announced AI features still hasn’t fully rolled out, and it’s fairly clear that the company is more or less two years behind its competitors in this space. While OpenAI is launching Tasks and Google is impressing the industry with their latest Gemini models and promising AI agents living in the browser, Apple is…letting you create cute emoji and terrible images that are so 2022, it hurts. That being said, I believe that Apple is aware of the fact that they need to catch up – and fast – and I kind of enjoy the fact that we’re witnessing Apple being an underdog again and having to pull out all the stops to show the world that they can still be relevant in a post-AI society. The company, unlike many AI competitors, has a unique advantage: they make the computers we use and the operating systems they run on. I’m convinced that, long term, Apple’s main competitors won’t be OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta, but Google and Microsoft. The Apple Intelligence features we saw at WWDC last year made for a cute demo; I think 2025 is going to show us a glimpse of what Apple’s true vision for the future of computing and AI is.

Title: DeepSeek’s AI Shockwave Hits NVIDIA Hard, Wiping Out Billions

AI microprocessor on motherboard computer circuit, Artificial intelligence integrated inside Central ... [+] Processors Unit or CPU chip, 3d rendering futuristic digital data technology concept background The artificial intelligence revolution is moving at lightning speed, and one of the biggest stories from last week underscores just how critical the technology has become—not just for Silicon Valley, but for America’s national security and global competitiveness. Enter DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that’s sent shockwaves through the market with the release of a new, highly cost-efficient AI model. While DeepSeek may not yet be a household name, its impact has been swift. Nvidia — the dominant player in AI chip design and, as of this morning, the world’s third-largest company by market cap — saw its stock price tumble after DeepSeek’s latest model demonstrated a level of efficiency that many on Wall Street fear could challenge America’s AI supremacy. To understand why DeepSeek is making headlines, let’s look at Nvidia’s market swings. Last Monday, the tech giant lost an astonishing $590 billion in market value. Tuesday saw a rebound of $260 billion, only to drop again by $130 billion on Wednesday. The company plunged 15.8% for the week, its worst weekly showing since September 2022. Why the volatility? DeepSeek’s AI model, built at a fraction of the cost of leading U.S. models, signals the potential for a new price war in AI. Unlike OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s Llama models—trained on expensive high-end semiconductors—DeepSeek has developed an alternative that is allegedly 45 times more efficient than its competitors. Its final training run cost only $5.6 million, compared to the vastly higher sums required for U.S.-made models. Cost vs. performance of select AI models For many investors, this raises big questions: Will AI’s profit margins shrink as efficiency increases? Are Nvidia’s high-priced AI chips at risk of being undercut? Most importantly, what are the implications for aerospace and defense, where AI is becoming an essential tool in modern warfare and national security? DeepSeek’s breakthrough isn’t just a financial story — it’s a national security issue. President Donald Trump wasted no time responding, saying DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call” for Silicon Valley. Supporting AI development, including the data centers that power it, is no longer just about business—it’s a matter of strategic importance. That may be partly why, in his second week back in office, Trump announced the launch of Stargate, a $500 billion joint AI venture led by SoftBank and OpenAI. Backed by Oracle and MGX, Stargate intends to invest $100 billion immediately into AI infrastructure in the U.S. The goal? To cement America’s leadership in AI and keep its edge in technological warfare and cybersecurity. But, as some analysts and investors are pointing out, if the Chinese can match American AI’s performance at a fraction of the cost, is $500 billion too high? In any case, the Stargate development should catch the attention of investors looking at aerospace and defense. AI-driven military applications, from autonomous drones to advanced cyber defense, are not just science fiction anymore. They’re already reshaping global conflict. The ability to train AI models more efficiently could shift the balance of power in how wars are fought, how intelligence is gathered and how cybersecurity threats are handled. Meanwhile, American tech giants are doubling down on AI investments. Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook that 2025 will be a “defining year for AI,” with Meta planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in AI infrastructure alone. The company expects to double its GPU capacity to 1.3 million chips by the end of next year, significantly ramp up AI hiring and bring 1 gigawatt of computing power online. The AI boom is already creating massive economic ripples. According to Sensor Tower, revenues for AI chatbot and AI art generators have skyrocketed from $30 million in 2022 — the year ChatGPT was launched — to nearly $1.3 billion in 2024, representing an incredible 4,100% increase. Sensor Tower reports that the U.S. leads the world in AI monetization, accounting for 45% of global revenue, while China lags at just 2%. Global AI apps are now a billion-dollar industry While DeepSeek has proven technically impressive, it’s also raised serious red flags. For one, Microsoft and OpenAI are investigating whether DeepSeek acquired data from ChatGPT in an unauthorized manner. And two, cyber intelligence firm KELA has already exposed major security vulnerabilities in DeepSeek’s R1 model, showing that it can be easily manipulated to generate malicious content, including ransomware instructions, fake news fabrication and even details on explosives and toxins. For this reason, U.S. military service members have been warned not to use DeepSeek AI tools due to potential security risks. Despite legitimate concerns, I agree with UBS that DeepSeek’s emergence does not derail the overall AI growth story. As its editorial team notes, AI is not a zero-sum game. A more cost-efficient model could actually accelerate adoption across industries, further fueling productivity gains and market expansion. For investors, this means keeping an eye on how AI is reshaping aerospace and defense. The biggest beneficiaries may not be the AI application companies themselves, but rather the firms building the infrastructure: semiconductor manufacturers, data centers, cloud computing providers, cybersecurity firms and defense contractors integrating AI into next-generation applications. With the U.S. making AI a national priority, we’re seeing an unprecedented wave of investment into the sector. Whether it’s OpenAI’s partnership with Stargate, Meta’s multi-billion-dollar AI expansion or defense firms using AI for military innovation, the message is clear: AI isn’t just the future of tech — it’s the future of national security.

Title: From JPMorgan to BlackRock: The 15 financial firms that file the most H-1B immigrant work visas

Full Content:
As President Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promises to crack down on immigration, questions remain about what might happen to skilled workers who come to the US on H-1B visas. Trump targeted the H-1B visa program in his first term when he signed the "Buy American, Hire American" executive order to rein in potential abuses. Ahead of the second term, however, he told the New York Post that he "always liked the visas," which US companies use to hire foreign workers with specialized skills, often in science and technology. "I've been a believer in H-1B," he told the Post in December. "I have used it many times. It's a great program." Still, the program's future remains very much up in the air: Last week, two Republican senators introduced a joint resolution to strike down a Biden-era rule allowing such visas to be automatically extended for 540 days, instead of 180 days. As such, Business Insider has run the numbers to find out which US financial services companies stand to be affected the most if these visas are tamped down again. BI used data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration data to analyze which financial giants file the most H-1B requests. The data covered the 2024 government fiscal year (the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024) and was collected from applications submitted by businesses that wish to sponsor a skilled worker's visa. We found that some of the largest banks, credit card companies, and asset managers are among the most active sponsors of these visas, including JPMorgan and BlackRock. While many of the filings seek tech and software workers, some firms have used them to hire investment bankers or investment professionals. Of course, not all filings lead to a hire and some filings may actually be for the same hire, as firms will refile to reflect amendments or to extend an existing visa. Still, the publicly available data provides a good indication of the H-1B visa demand among major companies. The firms listed either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record. Check out which financial firms are sponsoring the most H-1B visas, including the types of roles they are looking to fill: Total certified H-1B filings: 1,990 Total employees worldwide: 317,233 as of the end of 2024 Types of filings: More than 1,500 filings are for workers with "software" in their title. The firm also hired for roles like a vice president of investment banking, an executive director of liquidity risk management, and a managing director of client fraud prevention.

The company has also hired some divisional COO and CFOs through the program, as well as managing directors in areas like banking and financial crime control. Total certified H-1B filings: 1,058 Total employees worldwide: 239,000 Types of filings: Many of the filings are for tech roles, such as software engineering, application development, and information technology roles.

Total certified H-1B filings: 642 Total employees worldwide: More than 80,000, per its corporate website Types of filings: Morgan Stanley does not include job title information in their filings, only the level of seniority. The filings range from the associate level up to managing director. Total certified H-1B filings: 609 Total employees worldwide: Approximately 85,000, per its corporate website Types of filings: Most of Barclay's filings are for tech roles, but the company has also hired for director roles in global markets, equity derivatives structuring, and a credit desk quant role. Total certified H-1B filings: 587 Total employees worldwide: 31,600, according to a December 4 report Types of filings: The vast majority of filings are for tech roles, including a senior machine learning engineer and a variety of software engineers. Other filings include a senior M&A manager and a senior finance manager. Total certified H-1B filings: 575 Total employees worldwide: 74,000, per a 2024 press release Types of filings: Nearly a third of AmEx's filings are for manager roles, and the vast majority of those are in the tech and data science sectors of the business. The company has also filed for director roles in investment management and marketing analytics. Total certified H-1B filings: 500 Total employees worldwide: 213,193, as of the end of 2024 Types of filings: Similar to others on the list, most of Bank of America's H-1B filings are for tech roles, but the company has also hired a credit senior officer in a director role, an associate general counsel, and a VP who works with financial derivatives. Total certified H-1B filings: 453 Total employees worldwide: 220,167, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 Types of filings: Nearly 300 of Wells Fargo's filings are for roles with software in the title, but the firm had also filed for roles including a construction management director and a lead securities trader. Total certified H-1B filings: 447 Total employees worldwide: 33,400 employees at the end of 2023, per an annual report Types of filings: Mastercard has made 220 H-1B filings for roles with software in the title, while another 64 include the word "product" in the name. Other filings include roles such as a vice president of marketing, strategy, and operations, and a commercial counsel role. Total certified H-1B filings: 429 Total employees worldwide: 32,100, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 Types of filing: More than 80% of roles have software in the name, though the company has also filed for director roles in business strategy, market risk management, and treasury capital markets. Total certified H-1B filings: 354 Total employees worldwide: More than 20,000 globally Types of filings: The vast majority of BlackRock's H-1B filings only note the role level. A few specific roles were mentioned, including an external relationship management associate and a sustainable investing associate. Total certified H-1B filings: 294 Total employees worldwide: 109,396, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 Types of filing: UBS has filed for a range of tech roles as well as direct business roles, such as an alternative investments strategy director and a director of investment banking.

The move reduces fees on 87 different funds, and 168 total share classes of those funds. The average fee cut is 20% per share class. Vanguard said this is its biggest fee cut ever and will save investors about $350 million this year, based on current asset levels. "We're proud to build on Vanguard's legacy of lowering the costs of investing—which we have done more than 2,000 times since our founding—by announcing our largest ever set of expense ratio reductions. Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time," Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji said in a press release. The list of cuts includes actively managed and index-based products, with many of the funds representing billions of dollars. Stocks, bonds and commodities products are all included in the reductions. Some of the funds on the Vanguard list include: Fund fees for mutual funds and ETFs are assessed as an annual percentage of total assets under management for the share class. The fee cuts to VEGBX and some other actively managed bond funds is notable because active fixed income is emerging as a growth area for the exchange-traded fund industry. The booming popularity of ETFs, which can be purchased more easily than many mutual funds, is often cited as a key factor in driving down management fees for stock funds in recent decades. Vanguard said its actively managed fixed income funds and ETFs have a weighted average expense ratio of 0.10% versus an industry average of 0.53%. Vanguard has long been a leader in lowering fees among asset managers, a tradition dating back to its founder, Jack Bogle. Monday's announcement is a sign that the trend could continue under Ramji, who took over as CEO in 2024 and previously worked at rival BlackRock. The fee cuts come less than a month after Vanguard agreed to pay more than $100 million to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to disclosures around some of its retirement products.

Title: Why more retirement-age Americans keep working
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/retirement-age-americans-keep-working-rcna190469
Time Published: 2025-02-03T17:31:15Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time When it came time for Diane Wetherington to consider retirement, reality quickly set in. The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers’ due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn’t be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. “It’s just getting very hard to make ends meet,” Wetherington said. “The way the world is right now, everything’s going up, up, up.” Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It’s also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the “Peak 65 zone.” The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. “It’s really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now,” said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group “can help build key capacity where it’s desperately needed.” While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America’s population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program’s “full retirement age” from 65 to 67. “People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits,” Quinby said. “That shift triggered a trend in people working longer.” Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it’s “a bit crazy” that the expectation of retiring at 65 “originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire.” Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School’s Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it “because they have to.” They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can’t sustain them. “I call it the tale of two retirements,” Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. “The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy,” said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra’s human resources chief. “They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience.” Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. “They’re like vintage cars to us,” said FedCap’s Malatras. “They’re built to last, they’re full of value, but they’re treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don’t really have an opportunity to serve anymore.” Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren’t any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP’s pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix’s argument for employers is the impending “tsunami” of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don’t tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they’ll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn’t all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there’s a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra’s sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. “People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams,” Tinsley-Fix said. “They really benefit from having those folks.” Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they’ve benefited physically and mentally. “It was the best thing that ever happened to me,” said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson’s role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That’s where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn’t for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a “shock” after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. “I don’t enjoy not having things I have to do,” Sallee said. “I never envisioned the ‘sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail’ kind of lifestyle.” Still, Sallee said she’s taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. “If that ever becomes a problem,” she said of her yearly stretch of time off, “the vacation will take priority.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Texas Stock Exchange Raises $161 Million, Sees 2026 Trading Start

TXSE Group Inc., parent company of the proposed Texas Stock Exchange, closed its initial fundraising round at $161 million and said the TXSE has filed for registration as a bourse with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. If the registration is granted, trading would start in early 2026, the company said in a statement Friday. It had previously said trading would begin by the end of this year. The exchange – whose backers include BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities – is still targeting its first listings for next year. The upstart TXSE is seeking to join a handful of smaller bourses that are trying to bite off market share from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which dominate US public-equity trading. The challengers are battling for a piece of a shrinking pie: Listings have declined precipitously since the 1990s as the rise of private equity has made it easier for companies to avoid the costs of going public for longer. Additionally, the majority of US stock trades is now consistently occurring outside of public exchanges. The proposed Texas bourse says it wants to lower the cost of going public while “revitalizing competition for listings and enhancing trading in the US capital markets,” TXSE Chief Executive Officer James Lee said in the statement. The company was able to boost its capital raise by about $40 million since it disclosed in June that it had brought in $120 million. Other investors include Charles Schwab Corp. and Michael Dell’s family investment office. In addition to equities, the Dallas-based bourse plans to host auctions and sell exchange-traded products and data. It’s still looking for a space to house its permanent headquarters, which will contain offices, a conference center and a television studio complete with an opening bell. Topics Texas

Plus: Uncertainty Is Stressing Executives Out, Even If They’re Expecting Success; Tariff Talk Brings A Tempest To The Markets; Retail Apocalypse Predicted To Continue; Unions Score Wins While The NLRB Sees A Loss A new study from insurance company Sentry underscores a point that is likely to become a theme this year: Executives are optimistic about how their businesses will fare in 2025, but they’re also a lot more stressed. While almost half of the 1,000 executives and business leaders said they think their business will thrive this year, two-thirds are more anxious than they were at this time in 2024. The stress comes from many places. A total of 47% are under duress because of economic uncertainty, while almost as many—44%—say supply chain challenges keep them up at night. Other major stressors are financial—41% are concerned about the cost of employee health care and 36% point to inflation. More than a third are worried about labor shortages. The stress and uncertainty are keeping some executives from doing anything except working harder. Nearly all—97%—said they’ve deferred needed upgrades to their equipment, technology, cybersecurity or facilities. And almost half are asking employees to work longer hours. Findings of AlixPartners’ annual disruption index echo these concerns. Following the 2024 presidential election, the number of U.S. leaders who said they were more anxious doubled, from 23% at the beginning of 2024 to 46%. In that survey, 27% were concerned about shifting their manufacturing and supplier footprints, and 23% felt they needed to modify growth plans in response to U.S.-China relations. About 15% more said they needed to change their business model faster, and 12% fewer expect revenue growth this year. The whiplash of 2025 may end as the year goes on, or businesses will get used to the economic climate. However, the stress could burn some executives out quickly. The current average tenure of a C-suite leader is about four years, according to an analysis published last year in SHRM’s Executive Network, but in times of tumult and stress on business, it has historically been shorter. One aspect of business that has seen significant change is support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In the last year, many companies have moved away from their policies, and in his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump outlawed them in government. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about how this sentiment is reflected in boards of directors and C-suites. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump talks to reporters about tariffs in the Oval Office. Considering the hours he devoted to talking about tariffs on the campaign trail and the massive changes made by executive orders so far, it’s almost surprising that Donald Trump waited two weeks to enact the trade taxes. The first targets were initially Canada and Mexico, which will see a 25% tariff on most imports starting on Tuesday, as well as China, which will get an additional 10% tariff. (Canadian oil tariffs will only be 10% to “minimize any disruptive effect” on U.S. gas prices.) Monday morning, Trump granted Mexico a one-month reprieve in exchange for 10,000 Mexican soldiers being deployed to the border to protect against drug trafficking. On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that tariffs may cause “some pain,” but said it “will all be worth the price.” Most economists say tariffs tend to get passed through to the consumer, increasing prices for all Americans. Meanwhile, Canadian leaders have proposed a list of U.S. goods that will see their own 25% tariffs—including some food items, plastics, rubber, lumber and glassware. The tariffs were immediately felt on the stock market. Trump’s announcement affirming the tariffs Friday afternoon quickly erased a positive day on Wall Street, with all three major indexes tumbling. On Monday morning, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were all down more than 1%, with alcohol companies, vehicle manufacturers, tech companies and cryptocurrency seeing the biggest losses. The reaction to the tariff announcement reinforces the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s decision last week to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December, and GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation.” A Big Lots in Carle Place, New York that was closing last year. It is not expected to be a good year for retail. A study from Coresight Research predicts that 2025 is on track to see twice as many stores close as 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Up to 15,000 stores may close this year, while only about 5,800 could open. The study found that inflation, easy online shopping deals and suboptimal in-store customer experience are contributing to the closures. The year has already seen quite a bit of M&A in the retail space, Danziger writes. The biggest to date is JCPenney merging with the SPARC Group into Catalyst Brands. Higher-end brands have also been making deals—like Vera Wang’s acquisition by WHP Global, Stella McCartney buying back LVMH’s stake, Christian Lacroix’s sale to Sociedad Textil Lonia and Laura Ashley’s acquisition by Marquee Brands. Other brands that have been bought so far include Kapital, True Religion and Urban Skin RX. A Whole Foods Market in Commack, New York. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court. In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Egon Zehnder Global Head of DEI Cynthia Soledad. As scrutiny of diversity, equity and inclusion programs increased in 2024, the number of diverse individuals newly appointed to corporate boards decreased, though boards are more diverse than they were 12 years ago, leadership firm Egon Zehnder found in their 2024 global board diversity tracking report. President Donald Trump has also focused a number of executive orders on the topic in his second term. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about what this report means for diversity on boards, C-suite and corporate offices. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. There’s been a lot of demonizing DEI, but when you look at companies, a recent LinkedIn study showed nearly no companies cutting back on DEI. From where you sit, how does it break down? What are the actual feelings about DEI, both for boards and for corporations? Soledad: Starting with the corporate practices, I would say that the headlines are exaggerated. What is being called in a headline a “pullback” on DEI practices is usually not that. DEI work has evolved over time, particularly as regulatory and legal changes happen. For example, the affirmative action ruling a few years ago, and the subsequent legal test cases around corporate practices that look similar to affirmative action. Those regulatory shifts and changes in test cases do require companies to evaluate their practices and ask, ‘Is there anything that we would want to adapt and change because the regulatory environment’s changing?’ That's most of what I am hearing from the clients we work with: an evaluation given regulatory changes in the environment, not at all a rollback in terms of the importance of inclusive culture, diverse representation and continued investment. There is also a concern that, because of these headlines and sound bites, DEI is under attack and it affects morale. Companies are concerned that their employees will read these headlines and feel that these investments in inclusive culture are at some risk. I also am hearing from CHROs and DEI officers and CEOs that they are very focused on keeping employee engagement high, and helping those employees understand their levels of investment in DEI. How do you see President Trump's DEI policies in the federal government impacting the private sector? How about C-suites and boards? There is a ripple effect in the private sector partly because so many companies serve the federal government in some capacity, and these policies impact suppliers. In addition, these actions are obviously intended to sway public opinion. Even those companies who do not have government contracts will take note of the rhetoric, and their behavior could be influenced by the fear it is intended to create. The most direct possible impact is on corporate policies that influence supplier diversity, talent, and culture; impact to board diversity efforts could be softer. Nonetheless, these efforts are at some risk. Where do you see things going with the conversation around diversity, both as a policy in corporations, as well as with boards, in 2025? We can expect the landscape to continue to be fraught for the next year on this topic, with potentially more legal challenges to come. Because of this, companies will have to keep evolving their approaches. The commitment that companies, corporate leaders and board leaders have made to diversity and inclusion in companies is real. There is a core belief that companies are serving diverse customer bases, companies already have more diverse workforces than they have historically, and that they want to hold onto the best talent that they can. The core practices will remain steady. Companies are continuing to invest in building diverse pipelines of talent all the way up to the top, all the way up to board representation. Leaders say they want to protect that work, and to try to move through all of the distracting headlines as quickly as possible and stay focused on the core work. Apple reported record quarterly profits last week, but in some areas it missed analysts’ expectations. $124.3 billion: Net sales in the most recent quarter, up 4% year-over-year 11%: Year-over-year decline in China sales ‘Where we launched Apple Intelligence, performance outpaced the markets where we did not’: CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call The board of directors is more than just a check on the CEO nowadays.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: A deep dive on DeepSeek and the future of AI

UPDATED 11:10 EST / FEBRUARY 03 2025 by Ryan Stevens The tech world was shaken this past week with the release of the DeepSeek chatbot, sparking intense discussions about its far-reaching implications. In the latest episode of the CUBE Podcast, theCUBE Research industry analysts John Furrier (pictured, left) and Dave Vellante (right) break down what this development means for the industry, cutting through the hype to uncover the real impact. DeepSeek dominated the internet this week, sparking major discussions on AI, geopolitics and innovation, with its impact reaching from Silicon Valley to global markets. It put everyone on notice around AI efficiency, according to Furrier. “Is it a psych ops thing from China?” Furrier said. “Is open source going to change the game? There’s so many storylines. Is it a breakthrough?” All that dominated the Pod discussion this week. It’s possible that the release of the DeepSeek chatbot will bring with it some positives. It may teach everyone how to do things more efficiently in AI, according to Vellante. “That’s going to be a rising tide that lifts all ships, finally, because AI hasn’t lifted all ships as we know. It’s been narrow and focused in terms of those that have really gotten benefit from it,” Vellante said. “I think to the extent that we can lower the denominator … the value goes through the roof.” The real breakthrough here lies in DeepSeek’s use of a smarter, leaner model, according to Furrier. It was no fluke, having achieved the DeepSeek chatbot through smart model design and a mixture of experts. “They also did the distilling of other models, so they didn’t have to do the brute force crunching,” Furrier said. “They slashed memory, energy, and the time it needs to get the answers and reason with good performance without compromising performance. They get all that stuff … a lot of matrix multiplication involved.” The DeepSeek chatbot made a significant impact by combining innovative techniques in a way that wasn’t obvious, according to Furrier. It involved very clever engineering. “I don’t think it’s a breakthrough in a major way, but it was something that they did with the constraints that they had,” Furrier said. It’s possible that the developments lower costs and drive adoption, according to Furrier. It’s similar to what happened to the internet. “I was talking to some entrepreneurs this week. The classic AI trajectory, people are like, ‘Oh, it reminds me of the web,’ these critical moments,” Furrier said. “One entrepreneur said it reminds them of the iPhone revolution because the user experience shifted and that drove a lot of change.” People are saying that it’s a Sputnik moment, which may not be the best analogy, according to Vellante. But it does underscore that the development serves as a wake-up call. “Do you remember when in the ’80s, Japan’s ascendancy was freaking everybody out? I think this is significantly more competitive because the market is so much bigger and AI is so much more important today,” Vellante said. “But to me, the winners of the market, the market overall just keeps getting bigger and bigger the lower the cost is.” The DeepSeek chatbot news has driven several conversations over the past week. The conversation shifted from stock price impact to deeper discussions in Silicon Valley and the AI community about the true future of AI and its competitive landscape, according to Furrier. “What you’re starting to see is some of the things we’ve been saying on theCUBE here all the time, which is, it’s a systems revolution,” he said. “I call it the chip grid emerging, which is clustered systems, where it’s not about throwing gear at problems or GPUs. It’s the combination of the hardware configuration.” The event calendar for theCUBE is filling up, with theCUBE teaming up again with the New York Stock Exchange for a Super Studio event, welcoming Silicon Valley’s top CMO leaders innovating in artificial intelligence initiative on Feb. 14. This year marks the busiest tech event season for some time, according to Furrier. “Leading up to around 2018, I think, would be the height of the event season in terms of tech companies. I think we’re back at that level, Dave. I think we’re on the road every week in May,” Furrier said. April, May and June have tons of activity planned. There will be no shortage of things to discuss at the events on the calendar, according to Furrier. “There’s multiple threads, efficiency, software innovation, psych ops, global geopolitical Cold War race. I mean, this is all very interesting,” Furrier added. “Very, very interesting. We’ll keep track of it.” Antonio Neri, president and CEO of HPE Lina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission Donald Trump, 47th president of the United States of America Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO and chairman of Apple Inc.

Title: Betrayed by Green Capitalism, Here’s How We Can Build a Livable Future

In one way of measuring it, the mainstream framework to address the climate crisis has been a huge success. Promoting green energy, electric vehicles, conservation zones, carbon credits, carbon capture, and other new technologies has made billions of dollars for companies like Tesla, Google, NextEra Energy, British Petroleum, Saudi Aramco, Tongwei Solar, McKinsey & Company, and BlackRock. Governments have gained power through increased interventions in economic planning, and authoritarian regimes from China and India to Canada and the U.S. now have a new justification to carry out land theft against Indigenous and rural populations. And millions more NGO directors, aid workers, diplomats, accountants, entrepreneurs, engineers, academics, and scientists get a hand-out in the form of high salary employment managing the crisis. Where the mainstream climate framework has been less successful: Doing anything to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions driving the climate crisis. Nor has the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledged the reasons for this failure or presented a plan based in reality. Here are some truths the mainstream climate framework downplays, ignores, or covers up: There are tremendous short-term benefits to legitimizing the failed climate framework: jobs, money, attention, power, the comforting belief that those in charge are going to keep us safe. Likewise, there are immense obstacles to developing realistic alternatives: Lack of rewards, marginalization and silencing, state and corporate repression. The result is a sort of self-reinforcing confirmation bias. People aren’t exposed to the gaping holes in the official framework or to examples of the kind of changes we actually need, alternatives remain easy to marginalize as ​“fringe,” and the failed framework maintains its fatal monopoly. Our survival depends on escaping the dead-end cataclysm of the official response. But, we can’t enact solutions we’re unable to imagine — so let’s start imagining a real solution. It won’t be an easy exercise: We’ll have to jettison the entire institutional complex that has caused and is managing the problem. We’ll also have to envision change occurring through a completely different paradigm than the one we’re brought up believing in. There isn’t really an alternative, since the official framework doesn’t constitute a viable plan. And everything we do toward an ecological revolution makes our own lives better, makes our own ecosystem more resilient, and increases everyone’s chances for collective survival. (Editor’s Note: For more discussion of the research and reasoning behind these arguments, read the companion piece here.) A paradigm and a practice that could successfully confront the ecological crisis is one based on what I would call rooted networks. Rooted networks are ecosystemic and interdependent. They allow for everyone to define their own needs, to build their own relationships with their specific habitat, and to share resources and feedback throughout their habitat and across the entire system. The basic operating principles of rooted networks are: This paradigm allows each of us to maximize our potential for action and our unique knowledge, and to amplify both through relationships of mutual aid. Rather than small groups of experts and owners imposing blueprints on a disempowered society and muted landscape, we would all increase our connectivity to our neighbors and the land, understand their needs and their history, and build from there. Can you already hear that voice in your head braying out that such an approach is naïve? It’s strange how that’s the orthodox position in our politics. In the fields of urban science and computer science, AI or machine learning, neuroscience, encyclopedias, comparative cognition, the study of mycelial networks and ecosystems and other complex systems, the social organization of insects with large population groups, the data is practically endless: Decentralized networks have a high capacity for communication, learning, and innovation; they often have a sophisticated capacity for self-organization; and they tend to be more resilient in adverse circumstances where centralized, hierarchical systems are likely to catastrophically collapse. There are also countless examples of decentralized, complex, resilient societies throughout human history, continuing into the present. These include the hundreds of interlaced peoples of Zomia—the southeast Asian highlands— who are surrounded but still unconquered by some of the strongest and longest lasting states in history; the Amazigh of northern Africa; the Mayan peoples of the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; the Mapuche of the Andes and the Pacific coast; the four hundred Indigenous peoples of the Amazon. These are societies who have defeated empires and colonizers, who have survived and adapted to earlier collapses, or who overthrew their own ruling classes. They are peoples who find abundance and safety in ecosystems where states only see desert, who have cultivated the richest rain forests on the planet, and who even in the 20th and 21st centuries have launched major rebellions against oppression. Their traditional social structures provide them with decentralized networks and federations that are a major source of their resilience. An important strategy of colonialism has been to erase these histories and destroy or marginalize these cultures so we have to depend on those in power, believing hierarchies to be natural, believing states to be inevitable. But the truth of the matter is that decentralized networks are practical, they’re intelligent, and they work. The first few years after an ecological revolution will be hard, despite the intelligence and resilience of rooted networks, though many benefits will appear immediately. And we’ll avoid the worst of the suffering that lies ahead should we stick with the mainstream climate framework. The top priorities are food, housing, and healthcare for everybody. Capitalist property laws, car- and airplane-based transportation systems, industrial mono-cropping, and borders are threats to our health, so we abolish, destroy, or transform them. Climate refugees and unhoused people seize mansions and vacation homes, and the rest of us support them because universal housing is more important than the property titles of the rich. With climate disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, everyone’s homes are at risk, so empathy comes easier to most of us. We distribute all the food we find in supermarkets and warehouses, then turn lawns, golf courses, parking lots, and highways into orchards, gardens, forests, meadows, and wetlands. As we transition away from industrial mono-cropping, we gain some breathing room by harvesting fields that are already planted, planting the next seasons’ seed stores, and eating the livestock bred to satisfy the machinery of capitalist meat production. Without money, wages are no longer an incentive. The acceptance and goodwill of one’s neighbors isn’t just a mental health benefit: It becomes the basis for our survival, motivating us to learn cooperative practices. Workers in high pollution industries — once the bosses have no more power and there’s no rent to pay — will decide to protect their own water supplies, their own neighbors and families. They’ll cap oil and gas wells and phase out nuclear power plants on the safest timeline. The communities that inhabit affected watersheds will decide whether and how to dismantle hydroelectric dams. Fossil fuel emissions will begin declining immediately, reaching zero within a few years. As energy supplies diminish, priority will be given to healthcare facilities, food production facilities, factories that produce necessary tools and resources, and for seasonal heating or cooling in regions with extreme temperatures. Medical research will continue around the world, with the material support of regional community networks rather than the pharmaceutical industry. Those historically abused or silenced by the medical industry will be able to assert their own experiences, knowledge, and needs. Together, we will generate an informed prediction of the most frequent health problems that are likely to affect us over the coming years despite improved diets, healthier lifestyles, and drastic reductions in environmental toxins. This will help determine which high-tech production facilities for drugs and equipment are still necessary, and what resources they need to continue operation. Global networks will carry out similar assessments in other vital sectors like housing, travel, transport, communication, and food. Communities across the world will scrap and recycle unnecessary machinery and capitalism’s abundant trash, shut down or repurpose the factories, and build towards the material autonomy of every regional network of communities. The general organizational principles are these: Especially in the first few years of the revolution, one of the key activities is to shift resources globally to undo the forced dependence and vulnerability caused by colonialism. No country should ever have been turned into a plantation or mining pit for global capitalism, and no revolution will be complete if it forgets about the legacies of colonialism. Using cargo ships, airplanes, and remaining fuel reserves, a global network of former shipping industry workers, revolutionaries, community organizers, and engineers transport whatever is required for historically colonized regions to attain regional self-sufficiency, producing the tools they need for whatever technological culture they choose, so long as it does not damage the health and freedom of others. After about twelve years of major upheavals, life has settled into a much more comforting pattern. Communities source the vast majority of their food locally. Coastal communities might travel farther for food, when fishing, but they’re using sustainable, ancestral techniques: no trawling, drift nets, purse-seine nets, or dynamite. Food self-sufficiency means that if anything impedes the movement of food across a continent, the situation is uncomfortable for a season or two, but no one’s survival is threatened. And, if some disaster wreaks havoc on a community’s fields, herds, or orchards, they can use the relationships and infrastructure linking them to other communities to get their food from elsewhere. Nearly all the fruit and nut trees we planted in the early years are providing us with abundant harvests for a small amount of labor every year. The trees provide habitat and nourishment for other species in our ecosystem. The yearly piles of pruned branches provide an additional carbon-neutral fuel source. Together with companion planting and ecological grazing, we’re regenerating the soil and nourishing ourselves with the healthiest diets possible. In the first years, every community identified the least polluted land in their area for planting orchards, gardens, and pastures. Moderately polluted lands are reforested and the trees harvested there are used as building material. The most polluted lands can be slowly recovered with bioremediation and other techniques. Every community tends to wetlands, estuaries, meadows, and forests along its margins. In these spaces, we hunt species like deer that rely on us for a healthy rate of predation. We practice regenerative grazing with goats, sheep, chickens, cows, and llamas, reducing the intensity of wildfires and re-fertilizing soil. We collect medicinal herbs and harvest building materials like clay or wood, always in a respectful way, attentive to our impact, focused on helping our ecosystems grow stronger. On abandoned urban blocks, people tend to the jungles sprouting from the empty structures. Fungal networks, trees, insects, and hardy grasses are breaking down the concrete or asphalt covering the earth, slowly remediating the toxins, and turning a wasteland into a vibrant habitat. Housing patterns shift considerably. Most people prefer to adapt and repurpose what is in front of them, though thousands of idealistic, innovative communes also spring up on depleted agricultural land or in abandoned strip malls. Cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants generally shrink by about half in the first dozen years, whereas rural populations double or triple. A huge amount of work has to go into scrapping or renovating the wretched housing stock left over from capitalism. The new standard is for structures to last a hundred years or more without major repairs, to use techniques like passive solar and good air circulation for self-heating and self-cooling, and to have efficient, small-scale energy production built into the very design of our towns and neighborhoods. In cities, the best housing blocks are taken over and improved, while other blocks are used for workshops, factories, storage, or knocked down and gradually converted into habitat and, if the soil allows, gardens and orchards. In the countryside, people reform existing large structures or build new ones to create multiple houses, workshops, barns, and storage places clustered together. These clusters share walls and heat. They facilitate communal cooking on a larger scale and simplify the logistics for things like clean water, water remediation, composting, methane harvesting from compost and livestock, and efficient electricity generation. Ultimately, the divide between urban and rural has eroded, as nearly a quarter of the world’s population moves seasonally between rural villages and city neighborhoods, according to weather or labor-intensive agricultural activities like a harvest. Most villages and urban neighborhoods exist in pairs, with a declared bond and a circulation of inhabitants between a specific city block and a village that might be 50-100 miles away. People moving between the sites a couple times a year gain perspective and experience, and their mixed loyalties facilitate mutual aid and prevent the historical domination of urban centers over agricultural zones. Nomadic peoples, from Travellers to Bedouin, have made a huge comeback, aided by the abolition of borders and nation-states. So too have some of the major biomes worst impacted by capitalism. The commercial ​“forests” that took up land, depleted soil, and fueled wildfires from Canada to Chile have been transformed into real forests again, complex ecosystems that give life to thousands of species and provide a range of renewable resources to human communities. Likewise, the Great Plains and similar ecosystems from Siberia to the Serengeti are freed from the depravities of a capitalist market, whether in the form of industrial-scale beef and dairy production, gas and oil extraction or colonial conservationism and eco-tourism. On the Great Plains, for example, once dominant cattle ranchers, with no more industrial market to sell to and few protections against poachers and fence cutters, have either turned to smaller scale, intensive grazing practices that helped restore the prairies, or they moved out. Indigenous peoples and trusted friends and accomplices they invited along recovered most of their lands and are helping restore them by dismantling dams and pipelines and adapting traditional technologies, food cultures, and spirituality. Desertification has slowed significantly, and by the end of the century it’s predicted there will be at least four million wild bison, roaming free again. The abolition of borders and the recovery of large biomes have made a critical difference in one adaptive response that everyone should have access to for survival: migration. Humans living in regions that mining companies have turned into wastelands or that militaries have filled with depleted uranium need support as they leave their homes behind. And whoever migrates needs a warm welcome, some place to put down roots again. Ecosystems also migrate, and some species and habitats have to migrate rapidly away from the tropics or to higher elevations. A revolutionary response to the ecological crisis does much to mitigate the harm and turbulence, but the climate is already changing thanks to the last two hundred years of capitalist greed. Borders, highways, and the biodiversity deserts of asphalted cities, the lawns and parking lots of suburbia, were all huge impediments to migration. Now, attentive, ecologically-minded human communities aid migration — the migration of fellow humans, of other species, and of entire ecosystems. With universal healthcare and housing, an immediate decrease of toxins in our air, water, and food, and the recovery of Indigenous or locally-adapted food cultures, our health and happiness improve dramatically. Social decentralization and the abolition of borders allow us much greater resilience to the disasters caused by capitalism. With the end of fossil fuel production, commercial forestry, cement production, and capitalist food production, greenhouse gas emissions flip from the catastrophic levels permitted by the mainstream climate framework and move into negative numbers. Within about a decade, hundreds of millions of new trees and soil recovery across all the billions of acres of agricultural land on the planet has absorbed significant quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere. Energy production has hit net zero, with the shift towards clean-burning biofuels, mostly passive wind and solar, and maintenance of about half of the pre-existing hydroelectric infrastructure. Catastrophic floods and wildfires which release huge amounts of methane and carbon — and are usually left off the emissions balance sheets — decline sharply or are eliminated. And without states, the frequency and intensity of warfare, and its massive and uncounted carbon emissions, diminishes drastically. Coming back to the depressing reality of 2025: the IPCC is pushing for the global economy to reach net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. They also have a perfect track record of failure and no realistic methodology for reaching their target. The approach I’m describing here can effectively do better than net zero. It even has the possibility to quickly remove enough CO2 and methane from the atmosphere to stop the cascade of tipping points that capitalism has already begun to trigger, a cascade that would lock in 3-5ºC of warming and cause death, extinction, and suffering on an unprecedented scale. This approach benefits from being complex and intersectional. It improves quality of life, universalizes access to quality healthcare and housing, and takes major steps to heal the enduring legacies of white supremacy and colonialism. The mainstream approach, on the contrary, exacerbates many preexisting inequalities and rewards the corporations and institutions responsible for the disaster. No matter when we adopt a realistic response to the ecological crisis, it will be better for our own lives, for future generations, and for all life on this planet. It removes the filters that prevent us from seeing the problem. It empowers us to take action for our shared survival. And it gives us greater resilience to adapt and overcome.

Title: Former Barstool Sports CEO Erika Ayers Badan Debuts ‘Work’ Weekly Podcast: ‘I Love to Work, and I Love to Think About Work’

Time Published: 2025-02-03T14:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Erika Ayers Badan will share lessons from her seven-plus-year tenure as CEO of Barstool Sports — which she’s affectionately called a “pirate ship” — and other insights gleaned from her career in a new podcast series. Titled simply “Work,” Ayers Badan’s podcast premieres Monday, Feb. 3, with new episodes releasing weekly on Mondays. It’s available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Amazon Music (via this link). Indie podcast network Lemonada Media is handling distribution and ad sales for the show. Fair warning: “I’m gonna use the word ‘work’ a thousand times in this thing, because I love to work, and I love to think about work, and be at work and help people at work, and talk about work,” Ayers Badan says in the show’s trailer (listen below). She will talk through topics like “what to do when your coworkers are idiots, what happens when you hate your boss and what do you do when you’re stuck in a rut.” Related Stories VIP+ Why Letterboxd Became the Go-To Platform for Online Film Buffs How to Watch the 2025 Oscar Nominations Live “Work” also will cover a variety of topics including current events — like major corporations ending DEI programs, companies ordering workers back to the office five days per week, and “revenge quitting” — plus real-world work challenges she has struggled with in the past as well as those she currently faces. Ayers Badan’s guests on the podcast will include Lindsey Metselaar, host of dating podcast “We Met at Acme,” and Benjamin Kraim, founder of cannabis media and lifestyle brand WeedFeed. Popular on Variety In addition, Ayers Badan will discuss the backstories of sundry corporate jargon, like “circle back,” “bandwidth” and “EBITDA” (which, for the record, stands for “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization”). “This is an unfiltered, vulnerable look at work and what it takes to make it at work,” Ayers Badan says. “Work isn’t perfect and neither are people but they both can be great. This show looks at what’s happening in and around the topic of work and offers perspective, advice and knowledge to those seeking to do more or be more at work.” It’s not her first podcast rodeo: At Barstool, she hosted “Token CEO,” a series that provided an “inside look on what’s going on at Barstool HQ.” Ayers Badan left Barstool, the bro-focused media company, in January 2024. That came after Barstool founder Dave Portnoy bought the site back from casino and gambling operator Penn Entertainment for $1 (following Penn’s $550 million acquisition). Running Barstool under Penn’s ownership, Ayers Badan wrote in a memo to staff, “was a balancing act and kind of an exercise in futility — trying to generate bets at the same time as protecting a pirate ship while also subtly contorting it to be something more predictable, pacifiable and projectable to match with a casino company.” In April 2024, Ayers Badan was named CEO of Food52, a food-centered media and commerce company, after serving as a board member and adviser since 2019. “I have a brand-spanking-new job and what I wanted to do was to create a podcast for people who want to be better at work and want to make work a way to change and make their life great,” she says in the “Work” podcast trailer. She currently serves on the boards of the Premier Lacrosse League and public safety technology company Axon Enterprise (the maker of Taser weapons). Ayers Badan is the author of “Nobody Cares About Your Career: Why Failure Is Good, the Great Ones Play Hurt, and Other Hard Truths,” published in June 2024. Prior to Barstool, Ayers Badan held several senior roles at media and tech companies, including president of Bkstg, chief marketing officer of AOL, VP of Branding at Yahoo and senior director of MSN branded experiences at Microsoft. Lemonada Media is an independent podcast network founded in 2019 by Jessica Cordova Kramer and Stephanie Wittels Wachs. The company’s original shows include “Wiser Than Me With Julia Louis-Dreyfus”; “Fail Better With David Duchovny”; “Choice Words With Samantha Bee”; and “The Sarah Silverman Podcast.” It also recently announced Lemonada Books, a new imprint and co-development partnership with Gallery Books, a division of Simon & Schuster.

Title: NVO INVESTOR DEADLINE: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Announces that Novo Nordisk A/S Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Class Action Lawsuit

February 03, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until March 25, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk as well as certain of Novo Nordisk’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

I believe the Anglo-American-Zionist Empire has lost the quarter-century-long World War III that began with 9/11, i.e., the Neocons’ “New Pearl Harbor.” The U.S is now beginning its own solitary “long retreat” to “Fortress America.” Future wars are likely to be peripheral skirmishes. The U.S. can’t even get along with Canada and Mexico, is under siege by criminal gangs, and China is buying up Latin America. Even the Monroe Doctrine is barely breathing any more. In Europe, Ukraine has lost the war which the Neocons started, NATO is “the night of the living dead,” and Russia will integrate economically with Germany. The people of Europe are too smart and too scared to go down with the ship. Britain is in the midst of full-scale collapse. 500-years of British occult empire is done—stick a fork in it. The Black Nobility that heads the globalist financial elite—The “City,” the WEF, Bilderberg, the WHO, the “Woke,” etc.—is also seeing its world collapse. The parasite has been killing the host, and the host is in full rebellion. No more genocidal “jabs” for us, thank you. In the U.S., Trump’s main economic goal is to keep the stock market soaring so his donors can continue to ride the IT wave, which is the only U.S. asset class remaining other than farmland saturated with chemicals. The poor and middle class will continue to drown in the waves. BRICS will win any trade wars the U.S. starts. The great U.S. trade market is built on debt and is going under. Gurgle, gurgle, BlackRock. Israel and the Israel lobby will continue to be the albatross around Trump’s neck, so the Palestinian two-state solution has to re-emerge. Trump knows, or should know, that with a big Middle East war all bets are off. He may do it anyway. No one can say one more really big smack in the face is not coming. My advice to individuals in the Western world: look to your own survival, along with those of family and friends. Believe me, in today’s world survival is enough.

February 03, 2025 08:24 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit.

Title: 2025 NFL Mock Draft: Shedeur Sanders, welcome to Cleveland

Full Content:
The Cleveland Browns need a quarterback. They have the second pick in the 2025 NFL Draft — a draft with two clear cut quarterback prospects that have risen above the fray. Seems clear cut, right? But the Browns have several problems to address after following up Joe Flacco’s 2023 playoff run with a three-win campaign and the league’s worst offense. Cleveland has to surround that quarterback with playmakers and boost a once-proud defense. But thanks in large part to Deshaun Watson’s immovable contract — owner Jimmy Haslam handed him an unprecedented $230 million fully guaranteed after trading three first round picks for a player accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct dating to his time as a Houston Texan — the franchise enters the offseason an estimated $30 million over the 2025 salary cap. Keeping the second overall pick means not trading back and amassing the inexpensive assets that can guide the Browns from this place in salary cap hell. It also means putting a blue chip quarterback in a portfolio loaded with penny stocks. And that’s before getting to the fact one of the most outspoken personalities in football — a guy who could easily take aim at Cleveland’s myriad flaws and management issues — happens to be one of those quarterback’s very involved father. Despite all this, Shedeur Sanders? YOU are a Cleveland Brown. In this still entirely too early mock 2025 NFL Draft. Let’s see how the first round shakes out. Since it’s barely February, no trades in this lineup just yet. Let’s see which rookies make sense and where. Rich Barnes-Imagn Images Needs: QB, EDGE, OT, S, LB The Will Levis experiment was a valiant effort that ended in failure. Ward will run into many of the same problems Levis did — an understaffed receiving corps, weak blocking and an average-at-best run game foremost among them. But he also brings a higher ceiling to Nashville than the young veteran who’ll slide down the depth chart. Ward threw an FBS high 39 touchdown passes in fewer than 13 full games and added four more on the ground (and one through the air) in what would have likely been Miami’s best season in two decades had he finished up the Pop-Tarts Bowl. He didn’t, but that hardly matters; he’s a composed quarterback who’ll be an immediate upgrade in Nashville. Mike Watters-Imagn Images Needs: QB, OL, WR, RB, DT The Browns cannot separate themselves from Deshaun Watson’s contract, but they have to separate him from the starting lineup. A setback while rehabbing his torn Achilles took care of that, leaving Jameis Winston and Dorian Thompson-Robinson as the two available quarterbacks under contract for 2025. Winston is a viable but inconsistent backup and DTR was 2024’s worst starter by a significant margin. Thus, a team with several needs rolls with a boom or bust prospect in Sanders. The Colorado star’s penchant for big gains is tempered by his willingness to eat big losses in order to see those chunk plays through. That could lead to plenty of growing pains in an offense not set up to nurture him. Or he could power through and be a light in the darkness for a franchise dedicated to its own burial. Christopher Creveling-USA TODAY Sports Needs: QB, OL, CB, TE, RB, LB This isn’t the quarterback New York needs, but it’s a massive influx of talent that can spur growth on both sides of the ball. Hunter is some sort of mythical creature cursed to roam earth and he’s decided to make the most of it. He can punch up a young secondary alongside Dru Phillips (a rising star if 2024 is an indication) and Deonte Banks (a 2023 first round pick who regressed badly last fall). He can team with Malik Nabers to make life easier for whomever is throwing passes next fall. Head coach Brian Daboll is on the hot seat despite being 2022’s AP coach of the year. Finding the right way to deploy Hunter would give him job security and, importantly, give a tortured Giants fanbase something to cheer for after enduring six years of the Daniel Jones experience. Ben Queen-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, WR, EDGE, CB, OG The Patriots have many needs at expensive positions — just not quarterback. That leaves them in position to trade back should a passer fall and a desperate team try to move up. Or, in this case, they can just take the player most likely to tilt the outcome of the game on any given Sunday. That’s Carter, the latest Penn State pass rusher to wear No. 11 and make life hell for Big Ten quarterbacks. His 22 tackles for loss and 11 sacks each led the conference thanks to a relentless motor, absurd athleticism and a general desire to hit fellas so hard they forget parts of elementary school. Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, CB, S, DL, WR Johnson was a true shutdown corner at Michigan. He’s a big (6-foot-2), athletic defensive back who can hold his spot in press coverage or off the line and breaking toward the ball. He allowed a 52.9 passer rating in coverage this fall, which is only a disappointment compared to his 30.9 rating in 2023. Though a foot injury has forced him off the field since mid-October, he should be capable of bolstering his stock with a big Combine showing. That would be rain in the Jaguars’ desert. Jacksonville’s 0.14 expected points added (EPA) per opponent pass play was worst in the NFL. While this may not be the kind of offensive toy new head coach Liam Coen may want, it fills a major need and gets the Jags one step closer to a future where they don’t need to score 30-plus points every week to win (unless they’re playing the Titans). Detroit Free Press Needs: QB, EDGE, CB, RB, S Do I trust a Mark Davis franchise to make a meat-and-potatoes pick at No. 6? Not really! But Graham is the best player available and, as a Michigan man, someone for whom Tom Brady can easily advocate. If that message gets through, it’ll be an unexciting pick that makes Las Vegas undeniably better. Graham would pair with Maxx Crosby and Christian Wilkins to bring screeching chaos each time opponents drop back to pass. At 320 pounds, he’s big enough to be immobile against the run. He’s also quick and explosive enough to blast through gaps as a 3-technique lineman between the guard and tackle. Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: WR, EDGE, TE, S, QB, OT The Jets need a quarterback, but reaching for someone like Jalen Milroe here when there are a few similar options who’ll be around when New York makes its second round selection (or potentially trades up into the back half of Day 1) would be a poor use of draft value. Instead, they can make life easier for whomever is taking snaps next fall and take 2025’s top offensive line prospect. With Morgan Moses and Tyron Smith both pending free agents, New York needs a young pillar across from 2024 first rounder Olu Fashanu. Campbell is a big bodied, 6-foot-6 specimen who can keep pockets, and his quarterback’s jersey, clean. We’ll see how the pre-draft process affects his stock. Aryanna Frank-Imagn Images Needs: OL, EDGE, LB, WR, ETC McMillan’s stock may depend significantly on his pre-draft workouts. While prolific at Arizona — 2,721 receiving yards the last two seasons alone! — it’s fair to wonder if his crisp routes will have the same kind of cornerback-snapping potentcy at the next level. Even if he’s not a burner, there’s so much to like about his game. He’s got a Drake London-style catch radius, using exceptional ball skills and his long frame (6-foot-5) to protect the ball from opposing players. He can work outside or baffle defenders from the slot. But if he can’t consistently create separation, could he be doomed to a Quentin Johnston or (long sigh) N’Keal Harry-type career? Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, WR, S, EDGE, TE Ryan Ramczyk appears destined for a medical retirement, which stinks. Taliese Fuaga wasn’t quite the answer New Orleans hoped as a rookie. With the franchise mired in salary cap hell, New Orleans needs to find young, inexpensive players at premium positions. That’s Simmons, who used Ohio State’s playoff run to gain a minor edge over similarly rated prospects like Kelvin Banks, Aireontae Ersery, Josh Conerly Jr. and Wyatt Milum. Simmons has the chops to fix things as a Day 1 starter both as a freshman at San Diego State and a transfer with the Buckeyes the last two seasons. He’s long armed and powerful with the low center of gravity that should help him recover from rookie mistakes. Brian Losness-Imagn Images Needs: OL, RB, OL, S, EDGE Sure, the Bears already have D’Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson. But the Detroit Lions already had David Montgomery in 2023. Look what former offensive coordinator and current Chicago head coach Ben Johnson did after they drafted Jahmyr GIbbs 12th overall. Jeanty is a monster, Sonic and Knuckles rolled into one (seriously: his 27 handoffs per game were only one fewer than Montgomery and Gibbs combined for in 2024). He averaged 7.0 yards per carry and has scored 30 touchdowns (29 rushing!) in his first 13 games for Boise State. Now he gets to ease the pressure on Caleb Williams’s shoulder and thrive for a team whose 4.0 yards per carry ranked 27th in the NFL last season. Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, CB, EDGE, DT, CB Is Banks a tackle or guard? That’s the question that will follow him through the pre-draft process and may depend on his arm length. Here’s the thing, though. No matter how long his arms, we know he’s a certified butt-kicker when it comes to pass blocking. He’s quick, powerful and perpetually aware of where his quarterback is, using that position to leverage edge rushers right out of the play. Banks has a low center of gravity, allowing him to pry up blitzers and dispatch them behind the pocket. He’s similarly stout against straight-on bull rushes, using his strength to absorb punches and redirect defenders. Oct 12, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; Penn State Nittany Lions offensive lineman Anthony Donkoh (68), tight end Tyler Warren (44) and defensive tackle Dvon J-Thomas (91) celebrate after defeating the USC Trojans at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, LB, S, OT, WR, RB Jerry Jones loves a flashy skill player. While Jeanty would have filled a need, Warren can do the same thanks to his ability to do just about anything across the offense. Warren has the ability to produce as both a receiver (79 yards per game) and runner (197 yards on 24 carries). In this case, he’d team with Jake Ferguson to give Dallas some juice in 12 personnel formations, flanking CeeDee Lamb with two tight ends and, at least in theory, making life a bit easier for Rico Dowdle next fall. This may not be the star for which the Cowboys hoped, he’d be a rising tide for an offense that desperately needs a lift. Matt Pendleton-Imagn Images Needs: QB, OG, CB, DT, S The bulk of Miami’s defensive line rotation will be free agents this spring. Calais Campbell is 38 years old. Someone needs to hold down the other end spot in the Dolphins 3-4 to help Zach Sieler continue to thrive (and Chop Robinson to reach his potential behind them). Scourton, at 6-foot-4 and 285 pounds, can be that guy (also considered: Arkansas’s Landon Jackson). He’s a big bodied defender who can hold his own against double teams in the run game or crash through gaps to flood the pocket on passing downs. He’s agile beyond his frame and as powerful as it suggests, making him a proper disruptor for a defense that badly needs it. Butch Dill-USA TODAY Sports Needs: IOL, CB, EDGE, S Ryan Kelly, Will Fries and Mark Glowinski are all free agents. 2024 fourth rounder Tanor Bortolini could ascend to a new role up front, but more help is needed — especially for a team that needs to establish the run to open up the easy mid-range passes that have been missing from Anthony Richardson’s game. That leads to Booker, who may not be as exciting as drafting Warren or Luther Burden but still fills a major need. He can play multiple positions up front and create pancakes from all of them. He can play hyperactive at times, but he’s a bulldozer who understands his assignments. USA Today Sports Needs: EDGE, OT, DT, LB, CB Trading for Matthew Judon didn’t fix Atlanta’s pass rush. The Falcons ranked 31st in both pressure rate (28.1 percent) and sacks (31) in what proved to be another lost season. Keeping Williams in-state gives Atlanta another powerfully built outside linebacker with a high ceiling in the pros. The former five-star recruit is far from a finished project, but he should be able to provide the kind of strength and bend on the edge to win with power or quickness. His ability to contribute on all three downs is a boon, but his biggest value to the Falcons will be a growing arsenal of pass-rushing moves. The Knoxville News-Sentinel Needs: EDGE, DT, CB, LB, S Arizona needs a pass rusher and Pearce may be the last top tier sack-master in the 2025 class. The Tennessee star is slightly undersized at 243 pounds, but his get-off speed is a true problem and gives him an easy pathway to chase down opposing quarterbacks. He may not be a three-down player immediately, but he fits a need for a defense whose 31.4 pressure rate ranked 27th in the NFL last fall. Baron Browning and Dennis Gardeck are both free agents and Zaven Collins has 10.5 sacks the last three seasons combined (thanks in part to Arizona’s inability to find him a lasting NFL position). Pearce is a lottery ticket, but the jackpot here is large. Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, RB, IOL, DB Williams or Pearce would have been a boon for a Cincinnati pass rush that boils down to: a) Trey Hendrickson and b) end of list. Luther Burden could address the loss should Tee Higgins leave in free agency, though the Bengals may look to a larger wideout to fill Higgins’s shoes. That leads us to Starks, who has top 10 talent and could fill multiple roles in a depleted Bengal secondary. He’d be able to thrive in the slot or as an over-the-top presence or slide closer to the line of scrimmage as a run-stopper with strong tackling skills. He can do a little bit of everything, which is exactly what Cincinnati needs. Brett Davis-Imagn Images Needs: TE, LB, S, IOL Part of me wants to add Bowling Green tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to this offense — especially if D.K. Metcalf winds up quietly on the trade market this spring. But Fannin will likely linger on draft boards. Walker will not and he fills a need for a defense-first head coach like Mike Macdonald. The Bulldog linebacker can do anything from the middle of the field, whether that’s chasing down tight ends, filling run lanes or blitzing the quarterback (6.5 sacks in 2024). He’s a fundamentally sound, high floor player who can make an immediate impact. He also has the awareness and athleticism to be an All-Pro. It’s not a glamourous or high-cost position, but it’s one Seattle needs to upgrade. Peter Casey-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, IOL, CB, LB… WR? Green is a risk. At 248 pounds he’s a bit undersized. Playing at Marshall gave him limited reps against elite competition. But he wrought havoc in Huntington, recording 17 sacks in 13 games last season — including two against Virginia Tech and another against Ohio State. Green and YaYa Diaby would be a very different kind of edge rushing duo, but each is a high motor pest capable of disrupting the passing game. His explosive first-step and closing speed makes him a menace, so even if he can’t win with a bull rush he’s capable of shedding blocks and cleaning up from wherever he’s lined up. Jay Biggerstaff-Imagn Images Needs: WR, EDGE, DL, OT In this simulation, the Bengals passed on Burden because they wanted a wideout with a little more size. The Broncos, on the other hand, already have a 6-foot-4 Courtland Sutton as Bo Nix’s huckleberry. Now they get the 5-foot-11 Burden to add new depth and explosiveness to the offense. Burden is a shape shifter who can thrive as a sideline threat or devastating chain-mover over the middle. He’s got great hands and vision to pair with explosive acceleration for big gains after the catch. He’s also powerfully built blocker who can help create space on off-tackle runs. Between him and Sutton’s big body and red zone skills, Nix suddenly has a dynamic do-it-all combination to unlock the next step of his NFL development. Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News Needs: QB, WR, RB, LB, CB, DL Three years after drafting Kenny Pickett in the second half of Day 1, the Steelers charge back into the breach. Pickett’s inability to process through his reads quickly ultimately put his NFL ceiling at “three good throws per game.” Milroe could fall into a similar bucket. There’s reason to believe he won’t. His mobility makes him a proper 2025 NFL quarterback. He’s run for 1,257 yards and 32 touchdowns the last two seasons, a number made all the more impressive when you consider NCAA stats count sacks as lost rushing yards. He can also deliver dynamic strikes downfield, which suggests he can slide into the offense designed for Justin Fields/Russell Wilson last fall and generate some success. Tim Heitman-Imagn Images Needs: WR, EDGE, OG, LB, S Jim Harbaugh needs an impact tight end and his former ward Colston Loveland remains on the board. But, TWIST!, here comes a star from Harbaugh’s old arch rival instead. Sawyer’s game-sealing strip sack in the national semifinal against Texas was the exact kind of high-effort, high-impact play the old school head coach cherishes. With Khalil Mack a free agent (and contemplating retirement), the Chargers get a player who had 15.5 sacks the last two seasons and who attacks running backs like he revels in contact. Reggie Hildred-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, DT, IOL, CB, OT Eric Stokes failed to live up to his first round draft status. Jaire Alexander played seven games in 2024 and looks like a pending salary cap casualty. While Carrington Valentine and Keisean Nixon can keep this unit afloat, it needs an infusion of new talent. Revel has All-Pro upside, but his draft stock is hampered by his place at a Group of 5 school and the torn ACL that ended his senior season after three games. The long-armed defender has elite top-line speed and can be an eraser on deep throws. He can thrive in zone or man coverage, using those arms to press effectively or accelerating to close distance (15 pass breakups and three interceptions in his last 15 games). Matt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports Needs: DT, CB, S, RB Morrison may be the last member of a thin second tier of cornerback prospects — not as good as Hunter or Johnson but maybe a notch above guys like Jahdae Barron or Trey Amos. Like Revel, he’s coming off a final college season cut short by injury after playing only six games for the Fighting Irish in 2024. But Morrison is an explosive corner who can snap off routes. His ability to close to the ball led to an FBS-high 10 passes defensed in 2023 and a directive to stay the hell away from him in 2024. He’s allowed a 58.4 passer rating in coverage this fall. If healthy, expect his stock to rise through the pre-draft process. Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports Needs: IOL, RB, DT, EDGE Membou has risen up draft boards as a tackle who handled his business in the SEC and can flex inside as a game-shaping guard. That’s exactly what Houston needs after a deficient line kept C.J. Stroud running for his life and stunting his growth after a dynamic rookie of the year campaign in 2023. The Missouri lineman is a lean 320 pounds, somehow, built atop a foundation of crazy athleticism. He’ll be a marvel as a pulling guard and a rampart in pass protection. While he’s still a bit raw, he’d bring All-Pro upside to a line that badly needs it. Matt Krohn-Imagn Images Needs: OT, CB, WR, LB, S Los Angeles managed to hold things together after injuries ravaged its offensive line. But Alaric Jackson is a pending free agent and Joe Noteboom has reached the void years of his contract. Factor in a 32-year-old Joe Havenstein and you’ve got a glaring need for high potential young players at an expensive position. Ersery has the chops to be a long term solution. He’s a massive (6-foot-6, 330 pounds) tackle who has improved throughout his college career. He’s got quick feet and sound technique along with experience playing both tackle positions. While his floor may be slightly lower than other blockers available, he could hang out as a swing tackle for a year before growing into his enormous ceiling as a pro. USA Today Sports Needs: OT, S, WR, EDGE Ronnie Stanley is a free agent. While he played 17 games this fall, he’d combined for just 31 the past four seasons. At nearly 31 years old, relying on him as a long term solution is an iffy proposition. Fortunately, Baltimore has the talent in place to make a bit of a luxury pick here. Conerly was the anchor for an offensive line that allowed just five total sacks in Oregon’s regular season. He’s a fast-twitch blocker who processes angles and reacts with the intelligence and foot speed to counter edge rushers inside and out. That gives him the chops to get out into running lanes and clear space for whomever is behind him — in this case, Lamar Jackson or Derrick Henry. Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: WR, LB, EDGE, DL, IOL Aidan Hutchinson will return from the broken leg that cost him the bulk of what was shaping up to be an All-Pro season in 2024. He needs help. Marcus Davenport was supposed to be Robin to his Batman, but was also hurt in 2024 and will be a free agent. Detroit could re-sign him, but additional bodies are needed. Jackson would be a massive addition, both physically and on the stat sheet. The 6-foot-7 specimen is long and angular but has a solid bend to keep his pad level low enough to keep his leverage. He’s quick and strong and can win inside and out. Now he’d get the chance to clean up the messes Hutchinson sends him — and create a few of his own. The Providence Journal Needs: DL, CB, EDGE, RB, S Washington may have bigger defensive holes to fill than at tackle, but Grant’s slide out of the top 20 presents tremendous value for a unit in dire need of upgrades. The Michigan standout is a 340-pound crime against physics to clog running lanes and shrink pockets from the inside-out. The Commanders need it. They ranked just 27th in run defense despite 2024’s breakthrough. Their 33 percent pressure rate was roughly the NFL average, but on par with their 32.9 percent blitz rate. Grant can help Washington get to the quarterback without sacrificing extra defenders in passing lanes. Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images Needs: CB, LB, WR, EDGE, S The Bills survived the loss of 2023’s starting safeties after moving on from Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Now Damar Hamlin heads to free agency and even if he stays creates room for an upgrade. Would Emmanwori be too similar to returning strong safety Taylor Rapp? Physically it would appear that way, but there are Kyle Hamilton traits to the 6-foot-3, 225-pound defensive back’s game. He’s got the top speed to be an over-the-top deterrent and the size and tackling to be a bull against the run. He’s also the kind of worker who’d immediately ingratiate himself to Bills Mafia, which is a bonus. Petre Thomas-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, S, CB OT, LB Nolan Smith is evolving into a speed rushing nightmare. But Josh Sweat is a free agent (so is Milton Williams) and the pass rush around him needs reinforcements. There’s nothing general manager Howie Roseman likes more than adding a blue chip SEC talent to his defensive front. Umanmielen’s transfer from Florida to Ole Miss resulted in career highs in both sacks (10.5) and tackles for loss (14). He’s a wide-bodied edge rusher with a blistering first step and the hustle to stick with every play. He’s got a handful of ways to win on the edge, though none may be more effective than his spin. Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News Needs: CB, LB, RB, WR Nick Bolton is headed to free agency. While solid wideout and tailback options remain on the board, Kansas City has the opportunity to punch up the middle of its defense with a player who might be 2025’s best off-ball linebacker. Campbell is a do-everything monster who recorded 117 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, five sacks, two forced fumbles and an interception in 13 games last fall. At 6-foot-3 and 245 pounds, he’s a bulky-but-fluid linebacker capable of filling multiple roles along the linebacker corps. In this case, he’d pair with Leo Chenal to give the Chiefs two fairy tale-strong ball-stoppers in the second level.

DeepSeek’s catastrophic impact on AI tech firms looks like it’s slowing down. After dropping heavily early last week, the S&P 500 has made a fantastic recovery and now sits very close to its all-time highs. The rebound was largely due to Big Tech stepping up, recording top earnings, and most importantly, reassuring investors that the US is still a leader in AI technology. All in all, DeepSeek might just be a much-needed boost for US AI firms to step up and do better. This also happens to be terrific news for AI projects in the crypto space, who will not only benefit from a dog fight between AI companies worldwide but also from the crypto economy’s overall bullish outlook. If you want to take full advantage of the upcoming AI-crypto rally, here are the 4 best AI agent cryptos you can consider investing into. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is already among the hottest presales of 2025 – and its popularity (and price) will only increase as the hype and demand for AI agent coins are set to skyrocket post DeepSeek’s launch and Altman’s promise of rolling out even better AI models. $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that interacts with folks on online platforms like X and gauges the broader market sentiment. It then uses cutting-edge AI technology to deliver exclusive trading insights to token holders. MIND of Pepe offers two major benefits to token holders: 1. It offers 100% objective analyses, removing all emotions and bias from ruining your crypto profitability 2. It’s able to identify potentially profitable bets when they’re still at their early stages Currently available for just $0.0032532 per token, investing in $MIND could lead to crazy gains in the upcoming bull run. The project has already raised close to $5M. What’s more, early adopters will also be able to make handsome passive income through the project’s 457% staking rewards. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, check out our detailed guide on how to buy $MIND. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ($FET) is the largest AI crypto project on the market right now – it has a market capitalization of over $1.80B. This reflects its popularity and the vote of confidence from investors. $FET is truly a unique project, seeing as it’s a business alliance between three innovative AI companies: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. For context, alliances like this are not common in the AI space, which is still fairly new, meaning every company wants to race past the competition. Not only will this result in more transparency and innovation within the AI economy, but it’ll also level the playing field for smaller, resource-strapped AI companies. Where $MIND aims to offer crypto investment advice to retail traders like you and me, ai16Z is meant to simplify investing for venture capital firms. It will properly vet a company – including studying its financials and mission – to assess whether it’s worth investing into. Not only will this reduce the amount of human labor that goes into studying each prospective investment, but it’ll also massively increase the rate at which investment decisions can be made. Put together, ai16Z can very well be a game changer for venture capitalists. The $AI16Z token is currently trading at $0.38, which is a sizable dip from its all-time highs of around $2.45. However, it’s nearing earlier demand zones (like $0.2), meaning an uptick in price is highly likely from here. Freysa AI offers a fun challenge – convince the AI chatbot to send you money and that money will be yours! The tricky part, of course, is that you’re up against an AI agent designed to protect the very prize pool you’re trying to tap into, which is a pot of crypto. Freysa is admittedly tough to crack, but that’s exactly what’s fueling its hype. After all, who doesn’t love a real (and rewarding) challenge! That GTA V mission you’re trying to complete won’t earn you any money, but this will. The platform offers several game variations, each with a different prize pool – ranging from $7K to $50K. Interestingly, a user actually managed to convince Freysa to send him $20,843 by making the AI agent fall in love with him. With a market cap of over $270M, $FAI is currently trading at $0.034, which makes it one of the cheapest cryptos with massive potential. The larger trend for both crypto and the S&P 500 is expected to be bullish in 2025. However, no amount of market hype should overshadow smart risk management and investment hygiene. This includes only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing and doing your own research before putting your hard-earned money in crypto.

Title: ‘A Tidal Wave Of Fear’—Trump Tariffs Fuel Price Crash Fears For Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP And Crypto

02/03 update below. This post was originally published on February 2 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stalled after soaring higher following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory—with fears suddenly emerging the $4 trillion crypto bubble could be about to pop. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin, helped by Elon Musk’s leaked plans for crypto in the White House. Now, as one legendary bitcoin trader warns of a looming “financial crisis,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has flung the door open for Wall Street to further adopt bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting cycle. Wall Street banks “have to be pretty sure” their bitcoin and crypto activities are “safe and sound," Powell added. 02/03 update: Crypto prices have taken a huge step lower, wiping around $300 billion from the combined market that has been hard hit by the rapidly escalating trade war sparked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s volley of tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from China, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs, due to come into effect Tuesday morning, have also hit global stock markets, with investors balking at the prospect of tighter trading conditions. “A tidal wave of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been unleashed across the cryptocurrency market after U.S. president Donald Trump’s Friday tariff announcement,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive crypto payment platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “The prospect of prolonged higher interest rates has rattled all global markets. While bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark the King of Crypto is once again proving itself to be in a class of its own in marked contrast to altcoins bleeding dark red across the board.” Bitcoin plummeted overnight to just over $91,000, down almost 10% at its lowest, before rebounding to around $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies have seen far steeper declines, with ethereum down around 20% before recovering slightly and Ripple's XRP and ethereum rival cardano trading around similar levels. Solana, ethereum's biggest rival, has fared better, off by just 6% and exacerbating fears among ethereum holders that it could seize the altcoin crown. However, crypto traders have cheered analysis from Bitwise's investment guru Jeff Park, posted to X, who has outlined his thesis on why the coming trade war could be good for bitcoin. “Tariffs might be just a temporary tool, but the permanent conclusion is that bitcoin is not only going higher—but faster,” Park wrote, adding: “While both sides of the trade imbalance equation will want bitcoin for two different reasons, the end result is the same: higher, violently faster—for we are at war.” Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have leaned into bitcoin and crypto over the last year with a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helping to normalize bitcoin and crypto among the financial establishment. Powell’s comments mark a major shift in sentiment under Trump from the previous Biden administration that was hostile toward crypto. Under Biden, bitcoin and crypto companies complained of an unofficial policy to “debank” them, cutting off basic financial services and making it impossible to operate—which became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to a previous U.S. government policy to cut off industries believed to be at high risk of fraud and money laundering. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious Trump’s adoption of bitcoin and crypto—starting with his non-fungible token (NFT) collections, growing to support for a U.S. bitcoin national stockpile and culminating with the launch of a controversial Trump-branded memecoin—has led to regulators and government agencies reversing their opposition to the technology. Meanwhile, Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to put steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, setting the stage for a trade war that could spread around the world. Trump’s executive order will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, and an additional 10% tariff on China, due to go into effect on Tuesday morning. “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash,” Robert Kiyosaki, investor and author of advice book Rich Dad Poor Dad, posted to X, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the catalyst. “Good. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is debt, which will only get worse. Crashes mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Bessent Takes the Helm on US Debt Sales After Blasting Yellen

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- After repeatedly blasting Janet Yellen last year over her department’s strategy for issuing federal debt, it’s now up to Scott Bessent to make the call on sales of Treasuries, with bond dealers conflicted over what he’ll do in a pivotal release due Wednesday. Most Read from Bloomberg New York’s First ‘Passive House’ School Is a Model of Downtown Density When French Communists Went on a Brutalist Building Boom Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push In the past four straight so-called quarterly refunding plans, the Treasury has advised that it didn’t expect to increase issuance of longer-dated securities “for at least the next several quarters,” after a final bump up at the start of last year. Many dealers see that changing, in part because of past comments from Bessent, potentially watering it down to “a few” or “a couple” of quarters. The former hedge fund manager, before he was picked by President Donald Trump as Yellen’s successor, was one of a number of Republicans who charged Yellen with having artificially held down sales of longer-maturity Treasuries — which affect things like mortgage rates — to boost the pre-election economy. He also in August criticized the advance notice in the refunding statement as “the first time ever” the Treasury had offered forward guidance. “This is going to be the key point of the statement on Wednesday,” said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Corp. “I can’t help but think it’s a new administration, they want to have their own guidance.” Should Bessent, who has yet to build out his team at the Treasury after being sworn in to the job just last Tuesday, remove the guidance entirely, dealers cautioned longer-term Treasuries may drop in anticipation of increased supply. Several still see the previous language being retained for now, although a number of them viewed it as a close call. One challenge is that longer-term Treasury yields have jumped the better part of a percentage point since September — in part due to concerns about fiscal deficits and inflation in light of Trump’s plans for more tax cuts and tariff hikes. With higher levies set to kick in across-the-board on Canada, Mexico and China starting Tuesday, the refunding this week takes place at a time of particular uncertainty about the rates outlook. As of late Friday, 10-year notes yielded well over 20 basis points more than bills, which mature in up to a year, making them more costly to the Treasury, and raising the stakes for any move to boost longer-dated sales. “It’s a very different world now than back in 2023, when Yellen decided to lean more on bills,” said Jason Williams, a strategist at Citigroup Inc. “Bill yields back then were higher than those on coupon-bearing debt, but that’s not the case now and the absolute level of yields is also higher. Even if Bessent does want to extend the weighted average maturity of US debt, he’d want to do it in a slow and orderly fashion.” After a string of increases beginning in August 2023, the Treasury has kept its quarterly refunding auctions, which span 3-, 10- and 30-year maturities, at $125 billion. Even relatively modest shifts in size can have a market impact. Yields climbed after the August 2023 boost, and they dropped in the wake of a November 2023 move to temper the ramping up of issuance of longer-dated debt. Given outsize US fiscal deficits, the amount of debt the Treasury has to sell over time continues to climb, and dealers say increased sales of longer maturities is inevitable at some point. The Treasury on Monday is set to release an update on broader borrowing needs and cash-balance estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Santander and Societe Generale are among firms that expect Bessent to leave his predecessor’s guidance intact for now. Still, the consensus among dealers is that long-term debt issuance doesn’t actually move higher until the November refunding, with some seeing potential for a bump as soon as August. Cabana at Bank of America thinks it’s possible the guidance will disappear completely — something that could lead some investors to see an increase in sales as soon as the May refunding. BofA’s Katie Craig, along with Cabana, wrote in a note to clients last week to expect Bessent to ask the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of bond market participants, to undertake a study of investor demand for a potential boost in long-term debt sales. The Fed The politics of the issue came to the fore in mid-2024, with a paper by economists Stephen Miran — whom Trump has nominated to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers — and Nouriel Roubini accusing Yellen’s Treasury of manipulating the issuance of Treasuries. Yellen firmly rejected that idea, and one of her top lieutenants delivered a detailed speech to counter “misconceptions.” Meantime, there are other considerations, including uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will halt its steady reduction in holdings of Treasuries — currently running at up to $25 billion a month. While Chair Jerome Powell last week offered no hint on when that might end, when it is phased out, that will reduce the amounts the Treasury needs to borrow from the public. The Treasury specifically asked dealers in a quarterly survey this month for their views on Fed balance-sheet policy changes ahead. Along with a high degree of uncertainty about the fiscal outlook, “these are the two main factors that make the decision-making process a little bit more complicated moving forward, which on its own argues for maybe being a little bit less committal” in Wednesday’s statement, said William Marshall, Goldman’s head of US rates strategy. “There’s a cost to giving guidance and then not following through.” Keeping the status quo for issuance sizes would put next week’s refunding auctions on course for the following: $58 billion of 3-year notes on Feb. 11 $42 billion of 10-year notes on Feb. 12 $25 billion of 30-year bonds on Feb. 13 The Treasury on Wednesday is also seen keeping issuance of floating-rate debt unchanged, while continuing to nudge sales of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, higher. Yet another complication for Bessent is managing the world’s biggest bond market under the constraints of the federal debt limit, which kicked back in at the start of January. Any drawn-out episode in Congress over raising or suspending the limit will force the Treasury to slash bill issuance and spend down its cash buffer. “Once Bessent is kind of settled and we are through the debt-limit issue, then maybe they start poking around at longer-term issuance,” said Blake Gwinn at RBC Capital Markets. “So this meeting could be kind of a wash.” Unless the Trump administration is able to rein in the deficit, now seen running at an historically high 6% or more of GDP for years to come, bigger auction sizes are looming — with consequences for yields, according to Marc Seidner, chief investment officer of non-traditional strategies at Pacific Investment Management Co. “That suggests to us that there should be a greater risk premium, a greater term premium in long-term debt and a steeper yield curve.” Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, sees 10-year yields headed back to 5% or above, from around 4.5% currently. While there’s high uncertainty around the administration’s specific plans, “tax cuts and other things will definitely continue the deficit’s trajectory.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America’s Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Is DeepSeek China’s Sputnik Moment?
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/is-deepseek-chinas-sputnik-moment
Time Published: 2025-02-03T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, shortly before the start of the Chinese New Year, when much of China shuts down for seven days, the state media saluted DeepSeek, a tech startup whose release of a new low-cost, high-performance artificial-intelligence model, known as R1, prompted a big sell-off in tech stocks on Wall Street. China Central Television showed footage of DeepSeek’s bespectacled founder, Liang Wenfeng, meeting with Premier Li Qiang, the second-highest-ranking official in the Chinese government. A few days earlier, China Daily, an English-language news site run by the Chinese Communist Party, had hailed DeepSeek’s success, which defied U.S. restrictions on the export of high-performance semiconductor chips used to train A.I. models, as “not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a reflection of the broader vibrancy of China’s AI ecosystem.” As if to reinforce the point, on Wednesday, the first day of the Year of the Snake, Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant, released its own new A.I. model, which the company claimed “outperforms” competing products from U.S. companies like OpenAI and Meta “almost across the board.” Alibaba’s claims haven’t been independently verified yet, but the DeepSeek-inspired stock sell-off provoked a great deal of commentary about how the company achieved its breakthrough, the durability of U.S. leadership in A.I., and the wisdom of trying to slow down China’s tech industry by restricting high-tech exports—a policy that both the first Trump Administration and the Biden Administration followed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described R1 as “super impressive,” adding, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Elsewhere, the reaction from Silicon Valley was less effusive. OpenAI said it was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.” The Chinese company claimed it spent just $5.6 million on computing power to train one of its new models, but Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, another prominent American A.I. firm, described this achievement as merely “an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve,” which U.S. firms would soon match. Amodei did acknowledge the novelty in a Chinese firm being “first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions,” and he argued that DeepSeek’s progress makes “export control policies even more existentially important than they were a week ago.” Such comments demonstrate that how you see the DeepSeek story depends partly on your vantage point. To get an unofficial view from the other side of the Pacific, I arranged a Zoom call with a longtime China watcher, Louis-Vincent Gave, a co-founder of Gavekal, a Hong Kong-based financial services company. Gave, who is fifty and originally from France, moved to Hong Kong in 1997, shortly before the United Kingdom restored control of the former British colony to China. He has lived there ever since, analyzing and writing about China’s remarkable transformation into the world’s second-largest economy and its biggest exporter of goods. On Monday, the day Nvidia, a U.S. semiconductor company that produces the high-end chips most American A.I. firms rely on, lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value, Gave circulated a commentary entitled “Another Sputnik Moment” to his firm’s clients, which include investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies around the world. (The term “Sputnik moment” had first been applied to DeepSeek by the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.) Given China’s formidable strength in computer engineering and basic scientific research, Gave’s piece said, “fighting a tech battle against (it) always seemed a short-sighted strategy.” In our conversation, he reiterated this argument and said imposing the export restriction on China had been a big mistake, because “it forced them to be very focused.” The battle that Gave referred to started in 2018, when the Trump Administration banned the export of some key components for semiconductors to a Chinese telecommunications company and chipmaker, citing national-security grounds. The Biden Administration strengthened these restrictions several times, particularly as they applied to the most powerful chips made by Nvidia. In announcing the latest set of rules, last month, just a week before Trump’s second Inauguration, then Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “The U.S. leads the world in A.I. now, both A.I. development and A.I. chip design, and it’s critical that we keep it that way.” By then, though, DeepSeek had already released its V3 large language model, and was on the verge of releasing its more specialized R1 model. The firm says it developed both models using lower-end Nvidia chips that didn’t violate the U.S. export bans. “Did DeepSeek happen in spite of the restrictions, or did it happen because of the restrictions?” Gave asked me. To answer his own question, he dived into the past, bringing up the Tiger 1, a German tank deployed during the Second World War which outperformed British and American models despite having a gasoline engine that was less powerful and fuel-efficient than the diesel engines used in British and American models. “I think you could find hundreds of examples through history of necessity being the mother of invention,” he said. “You build a ten-foot wall; I’ll build an eleven-foot ladder. China’s just done this, and everybody is acting surprised.” Some people in the U.S. tech industry have made similar comments. In a post on X, Pat Gelsinger, the former chief executive of Intel, wrote, “Engineering is about constraints. The Chinese engineers had limited resources, and they had to find creative solutions.” These workarounds seem to have included limiting the number of calculations that DeepSeek-R1 carries out relative to comparable models, and using the chips that were available to a Chinese company in ways that maximize their capabilities. In another post on X, Andrej Karpathy, a prominent computer scientist who was a co-founder of OpenAI and a former director of A.I. at Tesla, said that DeepSeek was “making it look easy” by training a “frontier-grade” large language model “on a joke of a budget.” Although the theory that imposing resource constraints spurs innovation isn’t universally accepted, it does have some support from other industries and academic studies. A 2014 study of Swiss manufacturers found evidence to support the hypothesis. More recently, in a study of U.S. software startups published in December, two researchers at Harvard Business School and the University of Texas at Austin found firms that didn’t receive any outside funding until later in their development tended to “engage in a greater amount of experimentation with technologies, and also were more likely to carry out more significant changes to their technology stacks.” The evidence is far from definitive; the intuitive counterargument is that having ample access to technical and financial resources facilitates more experimentation than conditions of scarcity. But, in any case, Gave insists that many Westerners have been greatly underestimating the ability of Chinese firms to innovate, rather than merely copy. He said that this tendency was now evident in many industries, including nuclear power, railways, solar panels, and electric vehicles, where the Shenzhen-based BYD has overtaken Tesla as the biggest E.V. producer in the world. In fact, Gave drew a direct comparison between A.I. and the auto industry. “I’ve heard all the criticisms that, if it wasn’t for OpenAI, DeepSeek couldn’t happen, but you could say exactly the same thing about car companies,” he said. “BYD wouldn’t be here without Tesla. Sure, of course. But the fact remains that BYD is here. And it’s a better car at a cheaper price.” Elon Musk might strenuously dispute that final assertion, but there can be no doubt that the sudden arrival of DeepSeek, following on the heels of the rise of BYD and other Chinese E.V. manufacturers, has raised some awkward questions. “It’s a wake-up call to the West that there is no industry that is one-hundred-per-cent safe,” Gave said. In the American A.I. industry, he went on, the belief had been that if you invested enough in A.I. hardware, you could create a big moat and a lasting monopoly. “That belief has been exploded as well,” Gave added. I asked him what policy guidance he would give to the new Administration in Washington. “My job isn’t to tell policymakers what to do,” he said. “My job is to say, Well, this is happening, how do we make money out of it?” Still, Gave did offer some indirect advice. “The first thing is to acknowledge the reality that China is now leapfrogging the West in industry after industry,” he said. In his opinion, this success reflects some fundamental features of the country, including the fact that it graduates twice as many students in mathematics, science, and engineering as the top five Western countries combined; that it has a large domestic market; and that its government provides extensive support for industrial companies, by, for example, leaning on the country’s banks to extend credit to them. “They said, ‘No more lending to real estate. We need to be an industrial superpower.’ ” Gave’s argument is that this strategy has already succeeded, and the emergence of DeepSeek is the latest and most dramatic evidence. His manner during our conversation was serious but also wry. He noted that, when he posts his arguments about China’s economic progress on YouTube, as he occasionally does, they attract comments that he is spouting C.C.P. propaganda. This seemed to intrigue him rather than worry him. “When it comes to China, there is an emotional response that makes it hard for people to accept simple facts,” he said. ♦

Title: What's Next For CAT Stock After A Bleak Outlook?

[+] Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) recently released its Q4 results, with revenue missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported revenue of $16.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.14 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $16.4 billion and $5.02, respectively. Lower dealer inventory levels weighed on the company’s top-line. Furthermore, the company expects sales and profitability to trend lower this year. Separately, after announcing good results, Buy, Sell, Or Hold ABBV Stock At $185? This didn’t sit well with the investors, and the stock saw a 5% dip on Thursday, January 30. CAT stock, with 29% returns since the beginning of 2024, has performed in-line with the S&P 500 index, up 27%. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Caterpillar’s revenue of $16.2 billion in Q4 was down 5% y-o-y. Looking at segments, the Construction Industries revenue was down 8%, Resource Industries sales were down 9%, while Energy & Transportation revenue were flat y-o-y. Caterpillar saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 60 bps to 18.3% in Q4. A decline in sales clubbed with margin contraction resulted in earnings of $5.14 per share, versus $5.23 in the prior-year quarter. Caterpillar’s sales were weighed down due to lower dealer inventory levels as overall demand remains soft. This can be attributed to elevated interest rates and a high inflationary-environment. Looking forward, Caterpillar expects dealer inventory levels in 2025 to remain similar to levels seen toward the end of 2024. Taking into account the soft demand, Caterpillar will find it difficult to push the pricing higher. In fact, the company expects a slight decline in revenues this year, after seeing a 3% y-o-y decline in 2024. Although Caterpillar posted better than anticipated earnings, a top-line miss and a bleak outlook resulted in its stock seeing a 5% fall post the results announcement. Notably, CAT is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last 4 years. But, that still wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the stock were 16% in 2021, 19% in 2022, 26% in 2023, and 25% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and geopolitical tensions, could CAT face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for CAT to reflect the latest results, we think its stock is appropriately priced despite its recent decline. At its current levels of $375, CAT stock is trading at 17x trailing earnings of $21.90 per share. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 19x over the last five years. However, a slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the underwhelming outlook for sales as well as profitability in the near term. While CAT stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Caterpillar’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Alphabet (GOOGL+2.38%) is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Tuesday. The Google parent’s stock was up by around 2.2% during mid-day trading on Friday. Alphabet shares are up by more than 8% so far this year. The company is expected to report revenues of $96.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.23%). Net income is expected at $26.2 billion, while analysts estimate earnings of $2.13 per share. In December, Google unveiled Gemini 2.0, which it called its most-capable artificial intelligence model to date for the “new agentic era.” AI agents can complete some complex tasks autonomously for a user. Gemini 2.0's multimodal features, such as native image and audio output, “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,” the company said. With the new AI model’s reasoning capabilities, Google said its AI Overviews feature, which reaches one billion people, will be able to solve advanced multi-step queries, such as mathematical equations and multimodal questions. On Thursday, Google announced the rollout of its Gemini 2.0 Flash model to the Gemini mobile app and website. Meanwhile, Demis Hassabis, founder of Alphabet’s drug discovery subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, said its AI-designed drugs are expected to head to trial by the end of the year. “AI applied to science is a lot richer than just the language models,” Hassabis, who also serves as chief executive of Google DeepMind, said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We’ll hopefully have some AI-designed drugs in the clinic by the end of the year. That’s the plan.” Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind, announced deals in July to work with Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY+2.06%) and Novartis (NVS-0.04%) on drug research using its AlphaFold AI model.

Title: How corporate America got DEI wrong

By Maria Aspan An American flag flies outside a Walmart store in Miami. In 2020, Walmart was one of many large U.S. companies that pledged to fight racism and increase internal diversity. But now it, Amazon, Facebook and many other companies are ending some of those programs. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption Five years ago, in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the sweeping reckoning on racism it sparked, corporate America rushed to join in. Big businesses started making big — and expensive — promises to fight racism and increase diversity. Walmart, the world's largest company, spent $100 million on a new center on racial equity — and that was just one of many such investments. All told, the country's largest companies pledged almost $50 billion toward addressing racial inequality in the year after Floyd's death, The Washington Post estimated in 2021. And their CEOs announced these promises with solemn rhetoric about their companies' roles in fixing societal problems. "We want to address systematic racism in society head-on and accelerate change," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in June 2020. But today, corporate America is rushing just as quickly in the other direction. Mounting political and legal attacks have turned DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — from a corporate rallying cry to a politically toxic football. Many big companies had been backing away from their diversity promises even before President Trump was reelected. After long criticizing DEI, Trump last month signed executive orders that will terminate what he calls "illegal" DEI programs and policies throughout the federal government. He called the programs "radical and wasteful" and discriminatory against nonminorities who, he says, are denied opportunities and recognition as a result. Trump continued these criticisms last week, suggesting — apparently without evidence — that DEI programs at the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame for a deadly airliner crash. It may seem that big companies are just adapting to political and legal pressure, but diversity experts also blame a more fundamental failure: Many businesses didn't think through their pledges — or their costs — from the start, they say. So corporate America may have never gotten DEI right in the first place. "What we're seeing in the moment is the few companies who took it to heart … and the many who just wanted to sprinkle some DEI on top, especially after George Floyd," says Portia Allen-Kyle, who runs the racial justice nonprofit Color of Change. "And that was never going to be a viable strategy." Allen-Kyle is pretty pessimistic these days about the future of DEI in corporate America, and the fallout for Black and other minority workers. But some diversity experts see a silver lining from the scrutiny: They hope that companies that care about building fairer, more inclusive workplaces are rethinking their strategies — and may now finally have a chance to get it right. Conservative critics have long claimed that DEI is itself discriminatory. But these attacks picked up momentum in 2023, when the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action at colleges and universities, ending the consideration of race in college admissions. President Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20. Jim Watson/Pool/AFP via Getty Images hide caption That ruling handed a powerful legal weapon to anti-DEI voices like Robby Starbuck, a social media influencer who has successfully pressured several big companies to end diversity-focused programs. Starbuck has said he is focused on ending "wokeness" in corporate America and has posted on X that his activism will give workers "a neutral workplace without feeling that divisive issues are being injected." Now President Trump's efforts to end DEI in the federal government are expected to ripple into the private sector. Walmart, Meta, Amazon and many others have already joined the retreat, ending many of their 2020-era pledges and programs. For example, Walmart in November said it won't renew the funding for its racial equity center and that it will end some other diversity-focused programs. "We remain committed to creating a culture where everyone can be successful, and ensuring we are a Walmart for everyone," a company spokesperson tells NPR. The other companies have said similar things. For example, in a note shared with NPR, Amazon executive Candi Castleberry told employees last year that "we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world." (Meta did not respond to a request for comment.) Under the political headlines, there's a more subtle undercurrent at work. When Floyd was murdered, many big companies were already promoting themselves as leaders in society, not just business. This widespread trend was known as "stakeholder capitalism": Companies argued that they could do more to help workers, society and the planet, while also making more money for investors. But many experts saw this rhetoric as fundamentally flawed — and, it soon turned out, largely ineffective. Paying workers more inevitably costs money and cuts into short-term profits; so does turning down business opportunities that could have a negative impact on the environment. Meanwhile, CEOs who take stands on social or environmental issues risk drawing the ire of politicians and customers who disagree. "It is always going to be difficult, if you are a for-profit publicly traded company, to have your leader talk about anything other than maximizing profits," says Sekou Bermiss, an associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "That is, in the U.S., the way we are wired." But when Floyd was murdered, big companies had raised the expectations of employees and customers that they would take a stand. And Bermiss argues that many rushed into promises without thinking through the costs — or what made the most sense for each individual business. Instead, some companies relied too much on the prospect of financial rewards for DEI programs, or what became known as "the business case for diversity." "It was being pitched as 'Diversity is always going to help the bottom line,' Bermiss says. "But no one [who studies this] would ever say that." Indeed, although some analysts have made the business case for diversity, Bermiss' research has found that when companies increase the diversity of their executive teams, they generally don't see a financial impact — good or bad. Still, Bermiss and others point out that DEI policies can have significant business impacts, even if they're not apparent in short-term financial results. Having a more diverse team can help create products that appeal to more consumers, or help employees feel more satisfied with their jobs. Costco, for example, recently told investors that its DEI efforts "help bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings" and "enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed," among other benefits. The massive retailer, which also calls DEI part of its "code of ethics," successfully brushed off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal last month. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the nation's largest bank, has called DEI "good for business; it's morally right; we're quite good at it; we're successful." Costco successfully brushed off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal last month. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption It probably helps that both JPMorgan Chase and Costco are financial powerhouses, whose profits and share prices keep their investors happy. But both companies are also framing their DEI policies as a matter of morality or ethics, rather than just profits. That's exactly how more companies should be thinking about DEI, according to Bermiss — if (and only if) they see it as valuable. Bermiss acknowledges that not all companies will want to continue pursuing greater diversity, equity and inclusion. But he argues that if business leaders decide that pursuing such workplace goals is morally right and aligned with a company's values, then they'll be better able to stand up to criticisms or attacks. And, as he adds, that's firmer ground than hoping that "if we get two more Latinos on the board, our stock price will go up." Despite the ongoing pressures, Costco and JPMorgan aren't the only employers still spending money on DEI. In fact, some companies are ramping up: Paradigm, a tech consultancy that advises employers on diversity and inclusion, says it saw a 12 percentage-point increase last year in how many of its customers had dedicated DEI budgets. Paradigm CEO Joelle Emerson says that even companies that are ending DEI programs may rebrand the work rather than abandoning it altogether. Corporate America's diversity results have been "a mixed bag," she adds, "in part because companies often spent too much time and energy on initiatives that didn't have a measurable impact." Now she's hoping that employers are taking the time to create more thoughtful — and effective — programs to increase fairness. "I see this less as a rollback of DEI and more as sort of an evolution to the next phase of this work," Emerson says. Many of the companies ending DEI programs are scrubbing the now-politically toxic acronym from their websites and corporate statements. But their public statements insist that they still want to make everyone feel included. That could be a tricky balance, especially as the Trump administration continues ramping up attacks on DEI — including efforts to uncover rebranded diversity efforts inside federal agencies. And it remains to be seen whether corporate America can really be more effective while softening its language — and goals — around diversity, equity and inclusion. But Emerson, at least, is bullish. "I'm actually pretty optimistic about the future of this work," she says. "I'm not optimistic about the acronym DEI — nor do I particularly care." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

The London-based startup, which helps businesses collect recurring payments such as subscriptions, reported a net loss of £35.1 million ($43.8 million) in the full year ending June 30, 2024. That was a 55% improvement from the £78 million GoCardless lost the year prior. The firm noted that "restructuring activity" at the end of the full year ending June 2023 contributed to a reduction in operating losses in 2024. In June 2023, GoCardless announced it was cutting 15% of its global workforce. That took GoCardless' salary expenses down 13% to £79.2 million in the company's 2024 fiscal year. Still, while this improved the company's financial picture, GoCardless' CEO Hiroki Takeuchi told CNBC that revenue growth also helped significantly. "We're much more focused on the cost side ... We want to be getting very efficient as we scale," Takeuchi said in an interview last week. "But we also need to continue growing. We need both of those things to get to where we want to be." GoCardless grew revenue by 41% to £132 million in full-year 2024. Of that total, £91.9 million came from customer revenue. Last year also saw GoCardless record its first-ever month in profit in March 2024. Takeuchi said its his aim for GoCardless to post its first full-year profit in 12 to 18 months' time, adding it's "well on track" to do so. Back in September, GoCardless acquired a firm called Nuapay, which helps businesses collect and send payments via bank transfer. Asked whether GoCardless is considering further mergers and acquisitions in future, Takeuchi said the firm is "actively looking," adding: "We're seeing lots of opportunities come up." Following its acquisition of Nuapay, Takeuchi said GoCardless is currently testing a new feature that allows clients to distribute funds to their own customers. "If you take something like energy, the vast majority of the payments are about collecting money," he told CNBC. "But then you might have some of your customers that have solar panels on their roof and they're sending energy back to the grid, and they need to get paid for that energy that they're generating." GoCardless, which is backed by Alphabet's venture arm GV, Accel and BlackRock, was last privately valued by investors at $2.1 billion in February 2022. Takeuchi said the firm had no need for external capital and that there are "no plans" for an initial public offering in the near term. Fintechs have been watching Swedish fintech Klarna's plan to go public closely — but many are waiting to see how it goes before deciding on their own plans. With technology IPOs at historic lows, several startups have instead opted to provide employees and early shareholders liquidity by selling shares in the secondary market. In November, Bloomberg reported that GoCardless had chosen investment bank Lazard to advise it on a $200 million secondary share sale. GoCardless declined to comment on the report.

Title: Blue zones, where people live to 100, are a lovely idea. It’s a shame they don’t exist

Blue zones are places where people reportedly live in good health to over 100 years of age. These locations seem to hold the secrets of exceptional longevity wrapped up in the warm glow of red wine with family. Blue zones are a lovely idea, but they likely don’t exist. In fact, the extreme age of people who live in these areas may be more due to poor record keeping than healthy lifestyle habits. Examples of blue zones include Okinawa in Japan, Loma Linda in California, Sardinia in Italy and Ikaria in Greece. These areas have been studied in detail to understand why their people live such long and healthy lives and, more importantly, what we can do to emulate their longevity successes. The common factors include daily activity, drinking red wine, prioritising family, eating vegetables, having faith in something, taking time off, and celebrating life. These are (mostly) all very sensible things most people could integrate into their lives. But while all the blue zones mentioned have these factors in spades, it doesn’t take long to realise that endless small towns around the world, particularly in the Mediterranean, share these traits, yet lack exceptional longevity. Why do these blue zones have populations that are routinely dying at over 100 years of age if it’s not down to the factors listed above? It’s worth looking more closely at these areas and the factors that unite them. Some other factors common to blue zones include poor birth and death registration, poverty, specifically old-age poverty, high crime rates, worse health metrics, and remote regions of birth. In some blue zones, rates of smoking are often as high as 50 per cent, and rates of illiteracy reach as high as 80 per cent. This is not exactly what you would expect from an area where people are supposed to have exceptionally long and healthy lives. As a centenarian or supercentenarian who has lived to over 110 years, you would have been born when the record-keeping of births and deaths was either not present or less robust. The number of supercentenarians plummeted after the rollout of mandatory birth registration and census keeping in the United States. This suggests that when formal record-keeping was mandated, self-estimations of age, which were common practice at the time, were no longer accepted. But the strange birth registration issues don’t end there. Supercentenarians born in the US are 1.5 times more likely to be born on the first day of the month. In Japan, that figure rises to 2.7 times. This, to put it mildly, seems a little odd. When countries attempt to count their true number of centenarians, they are frequently surprised to learn that many of them are already dead. A 2010 Japanese investigation discovered that almost a quarter of a million of their centenarian population was already deceased. A similar investigation in the US found that 35 per cent of all supercentenarians were already dead. Of all the supercentenarians in the US and France, not one has an authentic birth certificate. Record-keeping for those born in the early 1900s in areas of the world that have struggled with poverty has been subpar. In reality, blue zones may be more of an artefact of poor record keeping rather than lifestyle. But that doesn’t mean we should ignore the lifestyle patterns identified in blue zones. They probably won’t be the determining factor that gets you to 110 years of age; they are, however, a great place to start if you want to add ten years to your life and live to 90. Rather than focusing on blue zones, it is better to examine lifestyle factors in longer-term studies and see how they impact lifespan. When people get the basics right by age 50 – not smoking, maintaining a normal weight, being active daily, maintaining modest alcohol intake, and maintaining a good diet – they can extend their lives by over a decade. That is more than a 10 per cent life extension. This means that the average male who gets these factors in check by age 50 will die on average at 87, and the average female who gets them right will live on average to 93. Getting them right is unlikely to get you to 110, as the blue zones would suggest, but you’re likely to live significantly longer than those who don’t get them right. What is even more important is that getting these healthy factors right can delay the onset of many serious medical conditions, including heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes, by 10 years. An additional 10 years without a major illness means the life years gained will be much higher quality. Adhering to these healthy patterns does not guarantee longevity, but it seriously increases the odds. If following a “blue zone” diet or way of life seems attractive to you, the data shows that it will likely extend your life by over a decade – just don’t plan on it extending your life to over 110 years of age. For that, you might need to work on your birth certificate forgery skills.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘I Think CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) Is Going Up Big From Here’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer looked closely at. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the impact of President Donald Trump’s first few weeks in office on the financial markets. Cramer pointed out that while some investors had expected severe tariffs under Trump’s administration, many have begun to believe that these expectations may be exaggerated. According to Cramer, Wall Street initially became excited about a potentially more flexible approach under Trump. Investors were concerned that Trump might take a hard stance against Mexico and Canada, but as the situation developed, it became clear that his actions would not be as extreme as initially feared. He added: “Before taking the White House, he talked about putting 25% tariffs on our two longstanding trading partners immediately but then when the America First Trade policy memo came out, we saw that the administration wants to study the situation.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently Cramer remarked that although Trump had made bold statements about renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America," his actual policies have been more tempered. Cramer noted that if Trump can find someone in Canada willing to negotiate, he would pursue that, and he’s already receiving business-like responses from Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum. He added: “Again, the rhetoric was hot, but the reality was cool. Sure there are some real harsh words for a lot of the environmental rules and regulations and grants that President Biden jammed through the last four years. Trump has no time for these.” In addition to trade policies, Cramer also commented on Trump’s stance regarding environmental regulations. Trump has made it clear that he has no patience for many of the environmental rules and grants implemented during the previous administration. Cramer pointed out that Trump views oil and gas as essential to America’s economic strength, believing that increased drilling and production would lead to lower oil prices and enhance U.S. power abroad. However, Cramer acknowledged that it’s unclear how much influence Trump can exert over the oil and gas industry. He emphasized the need for more infrastructure, particularly pipelines, to facilitate both domestic and international distribution of natural gas. While oil executives are aware of the political pressure to increase production, they also know that any loss of discipline in response to presidential demands could lead to plummeting prices and financial losses. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on January 21. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Cramer mentioned that CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock will gain from here and recommended buying the stock. “I think CrowdStrike is going up big from here. I think that [the] cybersecurity business is terrific. I think that they are just now beginning to play offense after that glitch that occurred. I do think that this is the time to own CrowdStrike and to own what George Kurtz has built.” CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company known for its Falcon platform, which provides various endpoint security solutions. In November 2024, Cramer mentioned the company and remarked: “Hey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.” CrowdStrike’s (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock has gained more than 30% since its outage in July 2024. Overall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently looked at. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI-Briefing: DeepSeek’s emergence from nowhere shows open-source is eating the world

In case you have been hiding under a rock for the past week, DeepSeek’s emergence (seemingly out of nowhere) has underlined the geopolitical aspect of one of the most disruptive forces in economic history. A key question facing the $225 billion-plus U.S. digital media sector is, how will its key players respond? Developments last week hint at such players adopting an open-source approach in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. Meanwhile, Digiday’s ad tech sources noted that, while DeepSeek poses a credible alternative to Big Tech, clients are in a cautious mood, particularly around privacy. The market disruption wrought by the technical feats of China-based DeepSeek’s new R1 large language model developed at a fraction of the cost of U.S. rival and AI talisman OpenAI and ChatGPT was demonstrated in stock prices. Notably, Nvidia, a leading supplier of GPUs essential for AI development, experienced a record one-day market value loss of approximately $593 billion, marking the largest single-day loss for any company to date. Meanwhile, the resulting impact on the market capitalization drops of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft — collectively, these companies dominate the ad-funded internet — were declines ranging from 5% to 10% in a similar period. The key to DeepSeek’s emergence was its open-source approach to developing its R1 model. This contrasts with OpenAI’s more proprietary strategy, where models are typically closed-source and access is provided through APIs. Despite the political tenor of the development, as exemplified by the privacy concerns flagged by Digiday sources, some of the internet economy’s foundational names are making moves that hint at an open future. For example, DeepSeek’s R1 model is now available on AWS, a sign (for some) of how the Amazon machine views others’ margin as its opportunity and will do whatever it takes to push its infrastructure strategy. One ad tech founder said potential clients are asking them to make sure they don’t use tech owned by companies like Amazon and Google, which makes having an alternative even more appealing. However, ad tech companies are still wary of using DeepSeek’s API and instead are looking for other options like running R1 on-premise. Elsewhere, some have noted the timing of Google’s Meridian — the online advertising giant’s open-source marketing mix model (MMM) — last week as significant. As Digiday sources recently observed, measurement is at the core of Google’s indispensableness in any media plan. However, as discussed extensively at last week’s annual leadership meeting hosted by the IAB, the loss of traditional audience-targeting signals, primarily third-party cookies, means Google’s ability to calculate how ads drive purchases is waning. Some interpret this embrace of the open approach from traditional walled garden players as a significant shift in their approach. Given the disruptive impact of AI on Google’s search hegemony, observers speculate if similar significant shifts in outlook can be expected from the titans of Big Tech. And the potential for downstream impacts are manifold, with ad tech sources telling Dgiday in separate conversations last week that they believe open-source models give them a chance to “control our own destiny.” Buy-side and sell-side sources told Digiday that R1’s transparency creates an alternative to black boxes like OpenAI and also offers them the opportunity to rely less on storing data with competitors like Google and Amazon. That doesn’t mean the Big Four won’t have a moat, but it does mean the moat’s eroded — at least for now. Meanwhile, OpenAI-patron Microsoft reported its latest earnings report last week, with CEO Satya Nadella declaring its AI business was approaching a run rate of $13 billion per year, up 175% year over year. This lofty figure failed to impress markets, though, as a comparatively modest revenue outlook for the coming quarter, along with residual concerns over the impact of DeepSeek, proved a drag on Microsoft’s stock price after earnings. Elsewhere, Apple also issued its earnings last week, and while its subsequent stock price fluctuations may have fared more stably than others in its Big Tech cohort, some noted how it will have to accelerate its AI deployment, i.e. Apple Intelligence, if it is to gain momentum. Given Apple’s increasing interest in the “services” sector, which increased 14% year on year for the reporting period to surpass $26 billion, and advertising in particular, it will be interesting to see just how AI will play a role in its Madison Avenue aspirations. Chris Vanderhook, COO and co-founder of publicly-listed ad tech company Viant, noted how the recent developments have been significant. “Because AI adoption is so early, they [Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.] didn’t get their hooks and claws into everyone yet,” he told Digiday. The Condé Nast-owned publication has recorded a four-times increase in revenue for its “Open Door” series and is planning a relaunch of its AD Shopping property, Astley said on the Digiday Podcast. Why publishers are finally facing programmatic’s hard truths. LinkedIn has been making a concerted effort to woo video creators since March 2024, when the company began testing a dedicated vertical video feed on its mobile app. Since then, video consumption on LinkedIn has grown consistently, with the company reporting 34 percent year-over-year growth in video uploads in Q4 2024 and 36 percent year-over-year growth in total video viewership in Q1 2025.

Title: Here’s the few foreign markets set to win on Trump’s return

Not every country’s financial market is suffering fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House — and money managers say relations with the United States are playing a growing role in deciding where to invest. As the likes of Colombia and Mexico are rattled by tariff fears, assets of nations seen as benefiting from close ties with the US leader, like Argentina and Ecuador, are getting an extra lift. While that’s particularly true in Latin America, where most countries count the world’s largest economy as a key trade partner, the Trump “friend-or-foe” factor is impacting emerging-markets across the globe, from India to Vietnam. “Winners here are not the traditional ones that we’d think about — there’s a new set of countries that will emerge as winners,” Amer Bisat, a managing director and head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock Inc, said at a recent industry panel. In today’s world, a country that “aligns itself politically to the US ends up being the winner — and that becomes much more of a transactional relationship.” Gramercy Fund Management, which was set up by veteran investor Robert Koenigsberger in 1998, echoed the view in its quarterly strategy outlook, saying the beginning of the new US administration should be characterised by a stronger emphasis on bilateral relations at the expense of multilateral ones. Bonds from countries including Argentina and El Salvador could enjoy “some market premium” at the start of the year thanks to their leaders having a good relationship with Trump, according to Gramercy. Turkey, India and Hungary could also benefit. Since Trump secured his return to the White House, dollar bonds of Argentina, Ecuador and El Salvador have handed investors gains of at least 11%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a 2.3% return for a benchmark index of developing-nation credits. Fears that Trump’s economic measures might boost the dollar and fan inflation in the world’s largest economy, cutting the room the Federal Reserve has to lower interest rates, have muddied the waters for developing economies. A lack of clarity around Trump’s tariff plans, which could have devastating impacts in emerging nations, have also dimmed the outlook for the asset class, which has been grappling with back-to-back annual outflows. Asian economies fare worse than emerging peers, with high trade surpluses against the US and secondary effects from measures on Chinese trade that risk stifling the region’s growth. Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand are some of the most at-risk nations should Trump enact across the board tariffs, with exports to the US as a percent of GDP in the double digits, according to US government data compiled by Bloomberg. “Identifying Trump’s friends and enemies is very important. The obvious challenge with the US is for China and everything that follows on from that,” said Arnab Das, a global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management Ltd. in London. “The tariffs are going to be levelled at different countries for all kinds of transgressions and bad behavior.” As part of a larger strategy to avoid any confrontation with Trump, India is already considering options to narrow its trade surplus with the US, possibly through a trade deal, cutting tariffs or importing more goods from the US. The country is also prepared to work with the Trump administration to identify and take back all of its residents residing illegally in the US. Investors in Europe have the additional complication of disentangling Trump’s views on individual countries and their leaders from his general approach to the European Union. Hungary, whose leader Viktor Orban is frequently praised by Trump and other US conservatives for a governance style Orban has called “illiberal democracy,” is a prime example for traders. ‘Winning’ In Latin America, El Salvador, Argentina and Ecuador are expected to receive strong US support during Trump’s term, according to Ricardo Penfold, a managing director at Seaport Global. Argentina’s dollar bonds have been on a tear due to Milei’s harsh austerity plan, and his affinity with Trump — he was one of the few foreign leaders to attend the US President’s swearing in — may help the country skirt tariffs, avoiding additional pressure for its beleaguered currency, said Jeff Grills, head of US cross-asset and emerging-markets debt at Aegon Asset Management. El Salvador has already started taking in US military planes filled with deported migrants and is working with Trump to develop an asylum agreement. Daniel Noboa’s tough policies against transnational gangs and his support for foreign military bases in Ecuador — should he win the upcoming election — will also appeal to Trump, said Nathalie Marshik, a managing director at HSBC in New York. Whiplash Meantime, countries that Trump had gone after so far have seen their asset prices getting whiplashed. Traders soured on Colombia earlier this week after a migration dispute resulted in a brief, but unexpected tariff spat, sending the currency down as much as 2% in one day. Panama, whose leader rebuked Trump’s threat to reassert control of the Panama Canal, saw JPMorgan Chase & Co downgrade its recommendation on the country’s bonds. Markets should take the risk more seriously and there’s “little clarity on the endgame,” strategists including Gorka Lalaguna wrote in a note last week. In Mexico, investors are waiting to see if Trump will enact the planned 25% tariffs on the country’s goods on Saturday. The White House said on Friday that Trump intends to move ahead with the idea, denying a report that he planned on delaying the implementation by a month. Unlike Mexico, Turkey has a balanced relationship with the US as the $29 billion trade volume is almost equally split between exports and imports, according to the US government data for 2024. However, this did not spare the country in 2018, when Trump sanctioned senior Turkish officials and raised tariffs on some imports in response to the extended detention of an American citizen, sending local markets into turmoil. While a good relationship with the US might help, it’s no guarantee of outperformance. Local factors — from elections in Ecuador to an IMF deal in Argentina — are still key to sustain gains. “The lesson learned is that Trump is willing to push very aggressively to use sanctions and tariff threats to achieve his policy objectives,” said Eurasia Group analyst Risa Grais-Targow. “There are a number of countries in the region that will end up capitulating.”

Title: Musk rips 'fraudulent' Treasury handouts as reports mount DOGE has access to federal payment system

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/02/2025 5:12:37 PM PST by Libloather Tech billionaire Elon Musk ripped alleged "fraudulent" Treasury payments on Saturday as reports circulated that the Department of Government Efficiency has gained acces to the federal government's payment system as the second Trump administration continues cutting what they say is government fat and overspending. "The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once," Musk, the chair of DOGE, posted early Saturday morning to X. Musk's post came just ahead of the New York Times reporting Saturday afternoon that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE personnel access to the payment system. The Treasury spends roughly $6 trillion per year on payments for federal agencies. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

The Treasury spends roughly $6 trillion per year on payments for federal agencies. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

There need to be some public hangings or breaking on the wheel or drawing and quartering or impalements; after a fair and impartial trial, of course. They thought no one would ever know. This means the order from that leftist judge enjoining the stop payment order doesn’t matter now. Now, that judge will need to order a cabinet level officer to make a payment. That will get interesting when the defense is fraudulent payments. I WONDER IF PEOPLE WILL REALLY GRASP WHAT THIS HAS COST THE USA??? “...They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once,” IOW, the US Treasury was the Democrats’ Personal Piggy Bank.......... What the heck is going on here? I’m dense so I need it spelled out for me. Otherwise it kind of looks like a weird Elon Musk takeover of the federal government. Didn’t question it : Well they had to get 10% for themselves and family. Elon Musk ripped alleged “fraudulent” Treasury payments, the mishandling of some $6 trillion tax dollars. “The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, <><>payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, <><>tax dollars went to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. <><>The Treasury officials literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once. There is so much corruption and greed that has been going on for such a long time gotta clean house Tariffs now, abolish the IRS now, establish a new treasury and lock up the old treasury, lock the thieves in it.... Biden nominee who says he's a Nigerian prince. An audit of all recipients of federal taxpayers dollars. Then it’s all published by Doge. USAID is under current audit. Lots of old krusty krabs with made up organizations receiving millions. Before being appointed by Biden to manage $6 trillion tax dollars, Nigerian immigrant Adewale Adeyemo was an Obama insider. <><>He was Director of the National Economic Council under Obama <><>he was also a Sr Advisor, the Former Chief of Staff, for Blackrock. <><>he oversaw Treasury payment approval in the amt of $6 trillion <><>He directed that no US Treasury payments be disapproved, even to international terrorists <><>he abruptly quit, and refused to turn in official documents <><>he had No apparent congressional oversight <><>he was previously the president of the Obama foundation. <><>did Treasury monies get illegally transferred to the Obama foundation? <><>is this the reason why Obama will not disclose his foundation finances? Thanks to Musk, we’re going to find out how MUCH the Treasury Department stole from the American taxpayers. People are going to prison. Biden really tried hard to destroy our country and he got away with it....makes you wonder why he wasn’t impeached? Bureaucratic Tyranny. If the agencies don’t spend the money (and then go cap-in-hand, begging for more), the spigots get turned off (or, at least, the flow restricted). Cloward Piven on steroids. Thank you. Yes the USAID “standoff” got my attention and made me start wondering wtf. I’m sure DOGE has access to this - it’s a fed web site.... https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_84096001_6800/ “I’m dense so I need it spelled out for me.” __________ Truth. Bless you.

I am an uber one member, but there is no mention of it being an uber one offer. Have attached a screenshot of what the banner looks like in post description Banner link from my second account If you have the deal it will show list of restaurants with red text "save on select items" Worked for me. $1.99 whopper with cheese after following your link dont see this on any of my two uber one accounts Not seeing it on my one account either. I found one item from a burger joint in my area, 81% off (Mofo Burgers carlton) Not currently Uber one member edit. Includes a bunch of fast food including red rooster, Betty's etc. It has worked for me and I don’t have uber one. $4.50 for a big boss burger at burger point Marsden Park. No Uber One here and yeah, hard to find places that have it but looks like Betty's Burgers and Red Rooster at least. Thank you OP Not much available except drab burgers. Hopefully some better offers around dinnertime. Thank you for sharing. Yeah got it too. It looks to be associated with Ubers current Cher promotions. All I have in my area is HJ’s and Red Rooster. Actually, every time you close it and reopen it, it changes the places. Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Strange when I refresh the Cher page the options do keep shuffling. The places don't change for me, just some disappear and reappear upon refresh Got a whopper cheese delivered for $5, thanks :) Not a uber one member and got the offer looks like pick up too nice edit: went with Barnacle Bills Chicken Burger, Chips and Coke for $3.97. Bargain. Appears to work with more than one order if you add two or more orders to cart before proceeding to pay for each seperately. I paid for two separate orders and the promotion applied to both. confirm this works Got one as a non-One member. Filter by "Offers" and every store with "Save on select items" will have something that's 80% off Scheduled a Beef Bacon Cheeseburger and Chips (RRP $21.50) from my local pub for $7 delivered. First time I've used UE in months. Thanks OP. Note not all stores with "save on select items". There are stores with that badge that won't have 80% off. Ah sorry - I checked 5 stores and they all had a discount in them. I think maybe they were pizza/burger type places so just got lucky (or unlucky) I guess. Got two separate orders burgers only? Works for burgers and pizza. Managed to get 4 orders before it stopped working. Chargrill Charlie, Betty’s work too Wanna know why these types of offers keep being restricted so much? Because of (inflammatory) like above abusing it and then bragging about it. and yet they still keep getting the deal? This is something for uber to fix on their end. think I got it but just 1 store after few browses. Got Fat Jak Johnny cheeseburger for $3.42 ex delivery/services thanks OP!! best ubereats deal in years! 2 pizzas for $10 👍 Pizza for $1.39 delivered 😂 I didn't get the Cher banner (and I'm not an Uber One member), but was able to find that some stores near me (Red Rooster, Chicken Treat, HJs) had the offer available. $1.99 Whopper with cheese for me… Thank you for making me feel better about ordering uber eats tonight (I was going to do it anyway) Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Whooper is the only option at the time of writing. No sub and no use for long. Only offer in mine is 1.99 whopper. Has a $14.99 delivery fee attached, apparently due to current high demand. It’s 6.30am on a Tuesday. I’m an uber one member. No option for pickup. how do i get to it ?? Seems like its per day? Ordered yesterday - and the banner is back up again Scummy of them to offer this only on the app which scrapes your data to sell to the highest bidder. I can access it on desktop too Where on desktop? I can't see anything with 80% off. from this link @CodeXD: Will give it a shot. Thanks. Edit: doesn't seem to come up on any of my accounts. Ordered yesterday, offer still shows today but much smaller selection (HJ’s Red Rooster and Betty’s) All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/02/2025 3:33:00 PM PST by governsleastgovernsbest On Sunday's edition of The Weekend on MSNBC, weeknight host Chris Hayes questioned Trump's machismo for imposing higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico than on China. He's tougher on allies than on adversaries, because that's easier, less risky. He even claimed Trump has been "extremely generous to adversaries" like Russia and China. HAYES: He likes the conflict, he likes to project strength, but he's sort of a coward fundamentally. And the stakes of actual conflict and fights with adversaries is much higher. And so this is a way of kind of, a little bit of bullying, and cake and eat it too, where he can, like, play tough against Justin Trudeau, which is a very different thing than playing tough against Xi. Co-host Symone Sanders analogized it to Trump's treatment of Gavin Newsom. While blasting Newsom in public, Trump, according to Sanders, is very polite to him in person. Sanders put on a soft voice, supposedly imitating Trump: "Hey, how are you doing? Good to see you." That's when Steele stepped in: "And he says it like that [puts on effeminate voice]: "Hey, how are you doing? [laughs]. It's kind of a little Mike Tyson voice."Get the rest of the story and view the video here. (Excerpt) Read more at newsbusters.org ...

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Krisztian Sandor Vlad Tenev joined BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in calling for clear regulations for tokenized securities in the U.S. Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind,” Tenev wrote. “It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to “rapidly approve” tokenization of stocks and bonds.

BlackRock spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF saw massive inflows following the broader market rebound. Bitcoin ETFs have continued to dominate institutional demand for crypto assets since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the funds. Inflows spiked the total digital assets market cap above $3.3 trillion, gaining over 4% in the US trading hours. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) recorded 5,250 Bitcoins in the last 24 hours. This shows growing institutional demand for BTC and other crypto assets, swinging the price past the $100K mark. BlackRock’s inflow outpaced the total daily production, signaling high institutional demand as bulls resume accumulation. Data from Farside shows that the total inflows on Jan 16 stood at $626 million, with IBIT and ArkInvests ARKB controlling the charts. IBIT captured 85% of demand, while the latter saw a huge $155 million in the same time frame. IBIT volumes outpaced both institutional investors and BTC production. The fund recorded 12 times more than the daily 450 Bitcoin production. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC notched $4.4 million,n while Bitwise’s fund attracted $2.7 million. BlackRock has remained a popular option for most institutional investors since its launch. The fund has over $55.6 billion in assets under management (AUM), exposing traditional investors to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s bid for an ETF in 2023 spiked interest from other traditional firms that filed similar applications. After the approval, the surge in applications and demand ignited the bull cycle, taking the asset price to an all-time high above $73K in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiast Solana Legend tipped a higher target for the wider market due to surging ETF demand and other factors. “We have the richest man in the world joining forces with the president to kick off a golden age for emergent technology BTC ETF is the most successful ETF launch of all time Strategic Crypto Reserve being floated. Adjust your targets higher.” The success of Bitcoin products increased investor appetite, leading to a demand for altcoin products. After the launch of spot Ethereum ETF, several firms have filed for Solana and XRP products. Skyrocketing optimism has also led to huge inflows in these assets ahead of anticipated pro-crypto legislation. While the present administration was hostile to the market, Donald Trump has pledged a pro-market approach, giving investors confidence. Demand for spot XRP products in the United States is a major factor for the sharp increase in price.

Watch CBS News Updated on: February 2, 2025 / 6:24 PM EST / CBS News On this "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan." MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump picks a tariff fight with America's top trade partners, federal workers brace for another tumultuous week, and the fallout continues from Mr. Trump blaming diversity policies for the midair collision of an Army Black Hawk and a passenger jet. Washington and the rest of the world are waking up to what feels like a new reality show, as President Trump continues to make good on his campaign promises, despite the confusion and controversy surrounding some of them. We will talk with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Brian Mast. On the good news front, American Keith Siegel has a happy family reunion following his release from Hamas captivity. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. One of the president's biggest campaign promises was to enact steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Saturday night, he did just that. And the move has already sparked international backlash and sent chills through the financial world. We begin with senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama – Ed. ED O'KEEFE: Margaret, good morning. These are sweeping tariffs, the present using a 1977 law to suggest there is now an extraordinary threat from fentanyl and illegal immigration and that all three countries are failing to address those challenges. So, starting Tuesday, there will be 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican exports, 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian exports, 10 percent tariffs on Canadian energy exports and 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China. This morning, the president acknowledged this could lead to higher prices, writing: "Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not," he wrote on his social media platform, "but we will make America great again and it will all be worth the price that must be paid." MARGARET BRENNAN: This has triggered a trade war. Canada's prime minister announced tariffs on American beer, bourbon, wine, lumber, fruits, clothing, appliances. So, Ed, what else should we expect is coming that could hurt American consumers? ED O'KEEFE: Well, we should anticipate there could be a tit for tat here, because the orders that the president signed Saturday night give him the authority to keep raising tariffs on the three countries if they respond in kind. And that could contribute to an uptick in inflation, which we have seen in recent weeks. Now, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke directly to Americans last night, warning the tariffs – quote – "will put your jobs at risk," potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. And he said Canada's planned dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs will raise American grocery and gas prices. And while President Trump accused Mexico of having an alliance with drug cartels, President Claudia Sheinbaum said: "If such alliances exist anywhere, they exist in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to criminal groups." And China says it firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests. It is planning to protest these tariffs to the World Trade Organization. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, what's on Secretary Rubio's agenda in Panama? ED O'KEEFE: Yes, well, you know, Rubio, of course, the first Latino secretary of state, so he is taking his first overseas mission here to Central America and the Caribbean to reiterate President Trump's concern that China now has too much influence over the Panama Canal. The Panamanians insist they have full control – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Ed. We go now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. He is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and joins us from Palm Beach, Florida. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes. Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax with the big game coming next week, if – avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, prices going to go up. The question around cars, I have read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to $10,000 on trucks, because we have actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico. I think as well about the fact that for years we have been encouraging businesses to leave China and nearshore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours, like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well. So this is a – remember, Donald Trump got hired trying to lower – saying he was going to lower grocery prices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Two weeks in, he's doing something that's going to do the absolute opposite. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will track the impact of this trade war. Senator, I want to switch topics. You are, as we said, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard. She had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. Lankford said it was a softball, but listen to what happened. (Begin VT) SENATOR TED BUDD (R-North Carolina): Did he betray a duty, did he betray the trust of the American people? Which is – according to Merriam-Webster, that's the definition of a traitor. FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD (D-Hawaii): Edward Snowden broke the law and he released this information in a way that he should not have. He also acknowledged and exposed information that was unconstitutional. SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R-Oklahoma): Was he a traitor at the time when he took America's secrets, released them in public, and then ran to China and became a Russian citizen? FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD: Senator, I'm focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You have worked closely with these senators. I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that, her refusal to call him a traitor, and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information, probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history. And the fact that Ms. Gabbard, who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden – she called him a brave whistle-blower – couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think, is disqualifying just on plain judgment. What would that – what signal, if she got in, would that send to the I.C. workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law, if she called Snowden a brave whistle-blower? And MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is, our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law. That's based on trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traitors in recent American history as such, as a traitor? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate? SENATOR MARK WARNER: I know there are a number – our committee is historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door. There is enormous MAGA pressure that – as we have seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We will know this coming week. But – and it's not just Snowden. It was America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called – or something we call Section 702. She left us totally confused on her views on that. And as well her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups, or echoing Putin's comments that somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: … that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities – agencies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch to see those Republican senators. I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump, he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations. Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger? And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation – that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were – almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country. If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations? This would be devastating. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's – well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret – Margaret, it – we have seen – but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like – it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for. But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air – the crash. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate. And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them? SENATOR MARK WARNER: … without legal authority. Pardon me. Say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to – is it being offered to air traffic controllers? SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is – I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on. And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs. What happens if they all quit? MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you – and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents. I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment. I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away? SENATOR MARK WARNER: No. I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this. SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo. Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example – down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution. And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs. He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term. The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was – President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking. And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well. That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid. These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing… MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador. Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority? MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars. And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad… MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … when it should be the American worker's dollar. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: … which is a – separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell – yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going. Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents… MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently. And let's make another point on this as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress – Congress authorizes and earmarks funding. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars – most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: So – I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure. I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say – this is a little bit hyperbole – but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad. That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea. I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done. It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about – you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change. MARGARET BRENNAN: … efficiencies in aids versus restructuring. So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course. But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID. As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's… MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground. The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened. So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what? MARGARET BRENNAN: But… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place? MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement. So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it. That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker. That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put – that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China. That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations. But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee. The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility – disability. Excuse me. The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it. Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal – a personal aircraft. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft. To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont. Good morning to you, Senator. Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe. But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well. And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: … not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator – Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it. Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break. I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week. Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time. One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many. But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines. Take a listen. (BEGIN VC) SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine? (END VC) MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy. But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism - MARGARET BRENNAN: But - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you - MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that - MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower. And, by the way, it's not just health care. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address. MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up. Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week. We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane. And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out? FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of "The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump. SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out. Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists? SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide. What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity. Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions. Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do. Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, "line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do." Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here. But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation? SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements. Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Macfarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom lining it. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still holding and three more hostages were released yesterday, including American Israeli dual national Keith Siegel. His niece, Hanna Siegel, is here with us this morning. Good morning. You've been waiting for this for over 400 days. How is your uncle doing? HANNA SIEGEL (Niece of Freed U.S. Israeli Hostage Keith Siegel): I'm - first, thank you for having me. I've been dreaming about being here today. He's - he's doing OK. He's - he's lost some weight. He's pale. But he's strong. And he's doing OK. Somehow. We're incredibly grateful. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean we've seen the video and the images of him being reunited with family members. Will your father, his brother, see him soon? HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. He's on his way. We've been staggering the family visits so as not to overwhelm him. But, yes, we are all - we are all going to see him. And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure? HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team. And I don't know what other issue you can say that about with these administrations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: The Trump team really did push it over the finish line. And we're incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful to - to all of them for the work that they did. I also just want to say the Qatari negotiators, mediators, who were part of the November 2023 deal were also instrumental. And then what I've learned in this completely bizarre experience is that there is a whole industry of people, NGOs, who work on hostage negotiations on behalf of families. We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them. So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, "it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal" And you were worried he was going to sink it. He has announced phase two of the hostage framework begins getting negotiated tomorrow, Monday. Do you think he's incentivized now to actually see this deal through? HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu. This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through. I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the remains of some of those Americans wouldn't come through until phase three. HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And phase two, we know, Edan Alexander, a uniformed IDF soldier, who is a U.S. citizen - HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The deal would have to continue to work to actually bring him home. Sagui Chen, we're waiting on him to be released as well. HANNA SIEGEL: Exactly. Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I - I emphasize that because when we talk about deals and diplomacy, these are lives at risk. And if the deal doesn't continue to stay in place, they may be at risk. HANNA SIEGEL: And - and these - and these are Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: These are Americans who need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hanna, thank you. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you so much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And congratulations. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's great news. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we go, "CBS Evening News" co-anchor and presidential historian John Dickerson has some thoughts on the tone of those Oval Office moments following tragedy. (BEGIN VT) JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): After the deadliest air crash in 20 years in America, President Trump responded, as presidents have before. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Differences fade because we are all reminded of the basic truth, that we are all human and life is fragile. In such rare moments, a president can transform private grief into public meaning. These presidential moments live in our collective memory. Ronald Reagan addressing the nation after the Challenger disaster. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): George W. Bush at Ground Zero. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The nation sends its love and compassion. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Barack Obama singing at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (singing): Amazing grace. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): In speech, by bull horn, in song, and now, by executive memorandum. That's how Donald Trump used the Oval Office where Reagan had eulogized the Challenger astronauts. Though the president had earlier declared an hour of anguish for our nation, for him, the hour only lasted a few minutes. He spent much of the remainder of this unique moment distributing blame. TRUMP: I put safety first. Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. And they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The starkest claim, the one behind the Oval Office signing ceremony, that diversity programs had caused the crash that killed 67. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a presidential memorandum titled Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety. In light of the damage done to aviation safety by the Biden administration's DEI and woke policies. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): When asked what proof he had that diversity was the culprit, and the president said he had no proof but didn't need any. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash. TRUMP: Because I have common sense, OK. And, unfortunately, a lot of people don't. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The president's certainty about the crash, despite the lack of proof, suggested for many Americans that the common sense he was referring to was that diversity means things automatically go wrong when people of color are in charge. In one press conference he traveled the entire length of the emotional register, from asserting that the differences between Americans fade to returning the focus to those differences. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Dub: the copy trading app that has teens talking

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Social media changed everything, from news consumption to shopping. Now, Dub thinks it can do the same for investing through an influencer-driven marketplace where users can follow the trades of top investors with a few taps. Think of it as TikTok meets Wall Street. Founded by 23-year-old Steven Wang — a Harvard dropout who began investing in second grade with his parents’ blessing — Dub is betting the future of investing isn’t about picking stocks but picking people. The app allows users to follow the strategies of traders, hedge funds, and even those mimicking high-profile politicians. Instead of making individual trade decisions, Dub users can copy entire portfolios. The concept has struck a chord. Dub has already surpassed 800,000 downloads and raised $17 million in seed funding — with a new round seemingly in the works. Less clear is whether Dub can avoid the pitfalls of previous fintech startups. Retail investing has evolved dramatically over the past two decades. The days of $7 trading commissions and clunky brokerage interfaces were blown apart roughly a decade ago by mobile-first platforms like Robinhood that invited people to trade for free. At the same time, social media is reshaping how people, and particularly members of Gen Z, make financial decisions. As a Harvard student during the pandemic — one who was trading from his dorm room “because you couldn’t really do anything at school” — Wang came to believe these two trends, retail investing and influencer-driven decision-making, were on a collision course. Between the GameStop saga, Elon Musk’s ability to “move the Dogecoin and Bitcoin markets with every tweet,” and people’s willingness to “really follow ideas and individuals to a whole new level,” Wang decided to drop out in 2021 and start building Dub. Right now, the platform’s average user is between the ages of 30 and 35, says Wang, though New York-based Dub is clearly finding its way in front of an even younger audience. In recent weeks, this editor’s 15-year-old has asked more than once about “investing like Nancy Pelosi” after marinating in Dub ads on Instagram. Pelosi isn’t personally trading on Dub; it’s just a trader on the platform mirroring her disclosed moves. Still, the idea has caught fire. “Nancy Pelosi is up 123% on Dub with real capital,” says Wang, “and we’ve made our customers millions of dollars since that portfolio was launched on the platform.” Dub isn’t free. Wang was determined to generate revenue from the outset, and Dub does that today through a $10-per-month subscription model. Wang says further that some “top” portfolios on the platform charge management fees and Dub takes a 25% cut of those fees. In the meantime, Dub has scaled in part through organic growth. “Creators who are good traders on the app are incentivized to bring their audience,” says Wang, whose parents immigrated from China and who grew up in Detroit. Dub is also investing aggressively in advertising, leaning heavily into Meta ads in particular to acquire users, including on Instagram. “We’ve been really lucky where I think the broader American population really believes there are other people out there that have an edge over them when it comes to the investing world,” says Wang. The question now is whether Dub will follow a similar path as other fast-growing fintech startups, many of which have found themselves in the crosshairs of regulators. Robinhood disrupted finance by making trading free, but it also faced regulatory scrutiny ahead of its 2021 IPO, ultimately ditching a feature that showered users with digital confetti every time they made a trade. Dub says it’s keen to avoid the same mistakes. The company spent more than two years working with FINRA and the SEC before launching, ensuring its model complied with financial regulations. “We didn’t just navigate regulation at Dub — we embraced it,” Wang says. (Like Robinhood, Dub is a fully licensed broker-dealer.) A big distinction, argues Wang, is that Dub is designed to educate users, not just encourage blind speculation. The platform displays risk scores, risk-adjusted returns, and portfolio stability metrics to help investors make informed decisions, he says. He suggests it’s safer for investors than Robinhood. Says Wang: “I have a lot of respect for what [CEO] Vlad [Tenev] has done in making trading free. But at the end of the day, making it super easy to trade without expert guidance, without education, is really just gambling for the broader population.” To underscore his point, Wang points to the decision of Robinhood — along with Coinbase and other exchanges — to make the meme coin TRUMP available for customers ahead of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. While it initially surged in price, its price has plummeted since. Says Wang, “I think fundamentally the incentives are just misaligned between these big platforms that are public companies now that need to make money” and that “generally” their customers have “probably lost money.” (Worth noting: In a separate, recent conversation with Robinhood’s Tenev about Dub, Tenev proposed to TechCrunch that copy trading could become of greater interest to regulators and that Dub may not yet be under the “magnifying glass” because of its comparatively smaller size.) Either way, not everyone is sold on Dub’s vision. The biggest knock against such platforms, says critics, is that stock picking underperforms passive investing over the long run, with studies showing that most actively managed funds fail to beat the S&P 500. It’s a criticism with which Wang is familiar — and on which he’s quick to push back. For one thing, he argues that many such studies are “cherry-picked.” (“I bet a lot of those are sponsored by the passive investing index companies,” he says.) Further, says Wang, there’s a reason that actively managed hedge funds like Citadel are thriving. “If you look at what the ultra wealthy can do, they’re giving their money to Ken Griffin of Citadel, [because] they’re consistently putting up non-correlated returns year after year after year,” he says. If one more broadly “looks at the growth of the hedge fund space and the asset management space,” continues Wang, “there’s a reason why it’s growing. It’s because they are making money for their customers.” Topics Editor in Chief & General Manager Loizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

Title: 3 Growth Stocks For The Next 5 Years
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-stocks-for-next-5-years/
Time Published: 2025-02-02T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries. It is interesting to note that Embraer allows customers to design their own executive jets using a new aircraft configurator. The company continues to see double-digit growth for aircraft deliveries, revenue and EBIT in 2025 and beyond, even as it navigates its supply chain constraints. 3. Attractive economics of E2 jets position it well for replacement opportunities Embraer’s E195-E2 jets are gaining traction in the Commercial Aviation sector, due to their superior economics and passenger-friendly design, including no middle seats and 40% larger overhead bins. The E195-E2 will feature automatic takeoff, an industry-first, before the end of this year, and can operate from shorter runways. Embraer’s E2 family offers 16% lower fuel consumption compared to its first-generation E-Jets, and 25.4% better fuel efficiency per seat. In 2024, Embraer sold 47 E195/E190-E2 jets and 26 E175 jets, up from 39 and 25, respectively, in 2023. The growing need to replace 3,000+ small narrow-body aircraft worldwide presents a significant opportunity for the E2 family over the next few years. The efficient E195-E2 is profitable at a ~80% load factor, a dynamic that highlights its potential as a preferred choice for both mainline and low-cost carriers, looking to expand connectivity to secondary cities. The number of cities without service or served less than once daily has increased from 49 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 85 in 2023, highlighting a significant opportunity for the E2 family’s capabilities. U.S. airlines are unable to operate the higher-capacity E195-E2 that has a maximum of 146 seats, due to the scope clause in contracts between airlines and pilots’ unions that limits the number of passengers a regional aircraft can carry to 76. If the scope clause is ratified, it may open the floodgates of the U.S. commercial aviation market for the E2 jets. 4. Solid spot in defense Embraer’s Defense & Security segment continues to perform well, delivering three new generation military multi-mission transport aircraft, the C-390 Millennium, in 2024, up from two in 2023. Embraer’s light attack aircraft A-29 Super Tucano is also seeing strong demand, with over 290 orders. Growing geopolitical complexity across the globe may boost defence budgets, and Embraer may be in the right spot to benefit. 5. Reclaiming investment-grade rating Embraer has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past three years, lowering its net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.3x in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.9x in 2021 (and 20.7x in 2020). It has no relevant debt to be paid back during the next 2.5 years. The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable. DeepSeek’s opacity raises doubts about its commitment to openness and responsible AI practices. 4. Nvidia: an established AI ecosystem DeepSeek is an AI startup, but Nvidia is an AI leader. Nvidia’s strength lies not just in its GPUs, but in its deep and integrated AI ecosystem, including its strategic partnerships and the CUDA platform – the gold standard for GPU acceleration in AI development. Shifting away from CUDA would pose an immense challenge for competitors, giving Nvidia a significant competitive edge. Nvidia itself expressed no existential angst, calling DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning model R1 "an excellent AI advancement.” Nvidia’s AI leadership, strong economic moat and proactive product innovation position it for continued growth. 1. Nvidia’s primary economic moat is its innovation Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. The company transformed its graphics processors into powerful AI chips, sparking unprecedented growth. By targeting the right end markets for its Omniverse platform, Nvidia succeeded where Meta struggled with its Metaverse ventures. The impenetrable CUDA armor is a further testimony to its Midas Touch. 2. Blackwell GPU demand outpacing expectations Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell GPUs are already in high demand, outstripping supply by a factor of 15. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Nvidia can supply only one chip for every 15 chips customers are looking to buy. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley sees Blackwell GPUs adding $15 billion to Nvidia's sales in the current quarter, with the potential to double in the next quarter. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri now sees Blackwell revenues of $9 billion for the January quarter vs. prior expectations of $5 billion, with sales rising in the next few years. 3. NVIDIA’s sovereign AI initiatives gathering momentum as India, Japan sign up NVIDIA’s Sovereign AI initiatives are gaining significant traction as India and Japan embrace the company’s accelerated computing for a new era of AI-driven industrial transformation. India’s Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including Tata Communications, are constructing AI factories, with Nvidia GPU deployments in the country expected to increase nearly 10x by year-end. Japan is building its most powerful AI supercomputer using Nvidia’s DGX Blackwell. 4. Immense growth potential in autonomous vehicles and robotics Nvidia’s Automotive and Robotics segment posted third-quarter revenues of $449 million, a small fraction vs. its record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. However, with its Cosmos foundation models, Nvidia is poised for massive growth in the autonomous vehicles and robotics sectors. Cosmos foundation models generate photo-realistic video to facilitate the training of robots and self-driving vehicles at a significantly reduced cost vs. using traditional data. Huang notes “We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama 3 has done for enterprise AI. Analyst Ives sees Nvidia reaching a market cap of $5 trillion as it unlocks this underappreciated growth opportunity in Robotics and AVs. TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1. Pole positioning as a critical AI enabler TSMC enjoys unparalleled leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors powering AI and data centers because of its superior process technology, strong foundry design ecosystem and reputation as a consistent and reliable chip maker. This unique positioning gives it pricing power and the confidence to set a target for long-term gross margins of 53% and higher. TSMC is reportedly looking at a 5% hike in wafer prices for 2025. The company affirmed that it sells its U.S.-made wafers at a slight premium to Taiwan-made ones, because of the higher cost structure in the U.S. 2. AI accelerators to drive 5-year growth Revenue from AI accelerators, including AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of TSMC’s total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, revenue from AI accelerators is expected to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. TSMC forecasts revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period from 2024. AI accelerators are seen as the strongest driver of TSMC’s High Performance Computing (HPC) platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 3. Long-term revenue growth at a 20% CAGR For the five-year period starting from 2024, TSMC expects long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms, fueled by all of its growth platforms – smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 4. Strong U.S. relationships For the skeptics worried about the U.S. export curbs on chips, it would be good to know that TSMC emphasizes its long-standing, good relationship with the U.S., and is building fabs in Arizona. Its first fab in Arizona has already entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of 2024, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to its fabs in Taiwan. TSMC’s plans for two more fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs will use advanced technologies such as N3, N2, and A16. 5. Upcoming 2-nm node presents strong potential TSMC’s Industry-leading 2-nanometer and A16 technologies meet the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. Other future offerings like N2P and A16 that are scheduled for volume production in the second half of 2026, feature further performance and power benefits over N2. Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market demand, positioning them for significant future growth. However, these companies don’t simply rest on their laurels; they continue to innovate ensuring their growth drivers remain relevant and impactful over the long term. With AI driving the growth narrative forward, Nvidia and TSMC are key beneficiaries. Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries.

The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable. DeepSeek’s opacity raises doubts about its commitment to openness and responsible AI practices. 4. Nvidia: an established AI ecosystem DeepSeek is an AI startup, but Nvidia is an AI leader. Nvidia’s strength lies not just in its GPUs, but in its deep and integrated AI ecosystem, including its strategic partnerships and the CUDA platform – the gold standard for GPU acceleration in AI development. Shifting away from CUDA would pose an immense challenge for competitors, giving Nvidia a significant competitive edge. Nvidia itself expressed no existential angst, calling DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning model R1 "an excellent AI advancement.” Nvidia’s AI leadership, strong economic moat and proactive product innovation position it for continued growth. 1. Nvidia’s primary economic moat is its innovation Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. The company transformed its graphics processors into powerful AI chips, sparking unprecedented growth. By targeting the right end markets for its Omniverse platform, Nvidia succeeded where Meta struggled with its Metaverse ventures. The impenetrable CUDA armor is a further testimony to its Midas Touch. 2. Blackwell GPU demand outpacing expectations Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell GPUs are already in high demand, outstripping supply by a factor of 15. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Nvidia can supply only one chip for every 15 chips customers are looking to buy. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley sees Blackwell GPUs adding $15 billion to Nvidia's sales in the current quarter, with the potential to double in the next quarter. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri now sees Blackwell revenues of $9 billion for the January quarter vs. prior expectations of $5 billion, with sales rising in the next few years. 3. NVIDIA’s sovereign AI initiatives gathering momentum as India, Japan sign up NVIDIA’s Sovereign AI initiatives are gaining significant traction as India and Japan embrace the company’s accelerated computing for a new era of AI-driven industrial transformation. India’s Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including Tata Communications, are constructing AI factories, with Nvidia GPU deployments in the country expected to increase nearly 10x by year-end. Japan is building its most powerful AI supercomputer using Nvidia’s DGX Blackwell. 4. Immense growth potential in autonomous vehicles and robotics Nvidia’s Automotive and Robotics segment posted third-quarter revenues of $449 million, a small fraction vs. its record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. However, with its Cosmos foundation models, Nvidia is poised for massive growth in the autonomous vehicles and robotics sectors. Cosmos foundation models generate photo-realistic video to facilitate the training of robots and self-driving vehicles at a significantly reduced cost vs. using traditional data. Huang notes “We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama 3 has done for enterprise AI. Analyst Ives sees Nvidia reaching a market cap of $5 trillion as it unlocks this underappreciated growth opportunity in Robotics and AVs. TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1. Pole positioning as a critical AI enabler TSMC enjoys unparalleled leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors powering AI and data centers because of its superior process technology, strong foundry design ecosystem and reputation as a consistent and reliable chip maker. This unique positioning gives it pricing power and the confidence to set a target for long-term gross margins of 53% and higher. TSMC is reportedly looking at a 5% hike in wafer prices for 2025. The company affirmed that it sells its U.S.-made wafers at a slight premium to Taiwan-made ones, because of the higher cost structure in the U.S. 2. AI accelerators to drive 5-year growth Revenue from AI accelerators, including AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of TSMC’s total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, revenue from AI accelerators is expected to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. TSMC forecasts revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period from 2024. AI accelerators are seen as the strongest driver of TSMC’s High Performance Computing (HPC) platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 3. Long-term revenue growth at a 20% CAGR For the five-year period starting from 2024, TSMC expects long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms, fueled by all of its growth platforms – smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 4. Strong U.S. relationships For the skeptics worried about the U.S. export curbs on chips, it would be good to know that TSMC emphasizes its long-standing, good relationship with the U.S., and is building fabs in Arizona. Its first fab in Arizona has already entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of 2024, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to its fabs in Taiwan. TSMC’s plans for two more fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs will use advanced technologies such as N3, N2, and A16. 5. Upcoming 2-nm node presents strong potential TSMC’s Industry-leading 2-nanometer and A16 technologies meet the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. Other future offerings like N2P and A16 that are scheduled for volume production in the second half of 2026, feature further performance and power benefits over N2. Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market demand, positioning them for significant future growth. However, these companies don’t simply rest on their laurels; they continue to innovate ensuring their growth drivers remain relevant and impactful over the long term. With AI driving the growth narrative forward, Nvidia and TSMC are key beneficiaries. Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: What's in store for remote work and RTO in 2025: 'Hybrid will be dominant,' says expert
URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/02/whats-in-store-for-remote-work-and-rto-in-2025.html
Time Published: 2025-02-02T14:30:01Z

Related Stories With the new year comes new goals, and for some CEOs that includes issuing fresh return-to-office mandates for their workers. In recent months, companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell and Walmart have called select staffers into the office five days a week. RTO marching orders reached the White House after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing all department and agency heads in the executive branch to "terminate remote work arrangements" and require workers report to offices full-time "as soon as practicable." Shortly after, the Trump administration offered buyouts to nearly all civilian federal workers to quit by Feb. 6. The trend could trigger waves of quitting and disengagement at work, though, experts warn, especially among high performers. Nearly half, 46%, of hybrid and remote workers said they would be unlikely to stay in their job if their employer called them back to offices full-time, according to a Pew Research Center survey of more than 5,200 people in October. Some companies may hope that work-from-home holdouts will quit rather than comply. Companies that plan to cut hiring significantly are more likely to impose RTO mandates than expand remote-work opportunities, according to research from ZipRecruiter; they also report higher turnover rates. In the past, the workers most likely to quit after the institution of an RTO mandate tended to be highly skilled and tenured star employees, according to research from the University of Pittsburgh. The study, which analyzed companies in the S&P 500, found firms that cut workplace flexibility experienced "abnormally high turnover," especially among women, senior and skilled employees. These companies took "significantly longer" to fill vacancies and saw their hire rates "significantly decrease," researchers noted. Thanks to a tougher job market for workers than a few years ago, those who want to quit but don't have anywhere to go are likely to stay and be a drain on worker engagement, says Mark Ma, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. "I might try to do the minimum so I won't be fired, then start looking for the next job. And once I find a better position, I will leave," Ma says. "So it's not an ideal situation for the employer." A better approach to reducing headcount is to conduct targeted layoffs of lower performers, Ma says. As of October 2024, a majority of workers, 53%, said finding a new job they want would be difficult, up from 37% of people who felt that way in 2022, according to Pew data. That's unlikely to entirely deter the nearly half of workers who would try to quit given stricter RTO mandates from their company. "It shows how much they really do value the flexibility that comes with hybrid work," says Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew Research Center. Generally, Ma expects "some form of hybrid will be dominant, rather than a five-day return-to-office." Of the S&P 500 firms he and his co-researchers studied in 2024, just 10 announced full-time returns for some of its staff throughout the year, he says. "Based on the data we are observing, I do not think the majority of companies will do that," he says. "Most firms have already figured out their hybrid policy by now. Unless something goes wrong, I don't think they will try to change that position." While 31% of businesses reduced remote-work options in 2024, 33% expanded them, according to ZipRecruiter data compiled from more than 2,000 hiring managers. Bigger companies may have more leverage to issue RTO requirements because they can offer more money and still attract a larger candidate pool, Ma says. However, smaller companies that can't offer as competitive pay might instead offer more flexibility as a non-salary benefit to attract hires. "Not many small firms are following," Ma says.

Title: Why Are Analysts Bullish on MGM Resorts International (MGM) Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. 2024 was a memorable year for the broad market index, which posted a gain of 23.31%, building on the 24.2% return in 2023. The two-year surge of over 53% is the best performance for the index since the 66% rally between 1997 and 1998. READ ALSO: 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025. The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power. The broader market rose 0.5% on January 23, going past its peak in December to a new record high. The gain added to the week-long winning momentum after data showed inflation slowing in the country more than economists had anticipated. With this rise, the index is up 4% since the start of the year. Investor sentiment has also been bolstered with President Trump reiterating his commitment to lowering oil prices and further cutting interest rates. The 78-year-old is also taking his time over tariffs by holding them off until February. Analysts believe a less aggressive approach than some had expected has helped the market move higher. Here is what Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at the Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, had to say: "He really can’t control interest rates, but the market likes to hear that kind of stuff. So far, the market does seem to like what Trump’s policies are going to be, so we’ll just have to see if there’s some follow-through." A string of strong corporate earnings reports has also supported the gains in January. According to data from FactSet, earnings for companies listed on the index are on track to grow by over 12% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. If that happens, this would mark the best quarter for company profits since 2021. While the overall outlook for the stock market looks encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the rally having gone too far, and a correction is in the offing this year. The threat of fierce trade wars sparked by tariffs, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, and broader inflationary pressures could also hurt the market. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro for Fidelity Management & Research Company wrote the following in a note on December 18. "Personally, I am bullish on stocks for 2025, though with valuations high and the bull market maturing, I don’t think investors should expect quite such spectacular returns next year as we have seen this past year. And I think there are important risks from inflation, and the market’s concentration, to be aware of." For this article, we went through the list of large cap stocks on the broader market index and picked the top 12 with the highest average share price upside potential. All data is as of the close of the day on Friday, January 31, 2025. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their share price upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial shot of an entertainment resort, its buildings and gaming amenities sprawling along the seafront. Average Share Price Upside Potential as of January 31: 51.60% Market Cap: $10.27 billion MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is an American hospitality, sports, and entertainment company with a significant presence in domestic and international locations. Its segments include Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China. The company’s properties offer hotels, casinos, meetings and conference spaces, dining, gaming, nightlife and other facilities. Currently, MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is pursuing targeted expansion in Asia, particularly in Japan, where the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism in 2023 approved the company’s plans for a $10 billion casino resort project in Osaka, which is expected to transform the city into a premier gaming and entertainment destination. It is also exploring opportunities in other markets in the region, including the United Arab Emirates and Thailand. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is also capitalizing on the online sports betting and iGaming markets through BetMGM, its 50% joint venture with Entain. BetMGM had an impressive third quarter of fiscal 2024, during which it achieved profitability, record iGaming results, and a 70% increase in first-time depositors. Moreover, MGM boasts a healthy return on equity in the high teens and generates substantial free cash flow, which allows the company to reinvest in its business, execute share repurchase programs, and enhance shareholder value. This has resulted in a general bullish sentiment around the stock. Wall Street analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating for MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) with an average share price upside potential of nearly 52%, making it one of the best large-cap stocks to invest in according to analysts. Investor sentiment is seeing an improvement as well. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 46 hedge funds held a stake in the company, up from 44 at the end of the second quarter. Overall MGM ranks 7th on our list of the best S&P 500 stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MGM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Trump tariffs, more Big Tech earnings, and a jobs report: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks swiftly recovered from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off early in the week but came under pressure on Monday amid concerns over President Trump's tariff plans. Trump followed through with his plans on Saturday, placing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4. There will be 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China, over issues of fentanyl and illegal migration. Markets are digesting the tariff announcements after a strong start to the year. In January, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 2.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced more than 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 4.7%. In the week ahead, investors will parse the latest developments in Trump's tariff strategy, the January jobs report, and an onslaught of corporate reports. Updates on job openings, as well as activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also be on the schedule. Meanwhile, quarterly results from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Chipotle (CMG), and Eli Lilly (LLY) headline a week that will feature earnings reports from 131 S&P 500 companies. Tariff reaction will be at the forefront of the market narrative in the week ahead. The duties on all three countries will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4, according to the order signed by Trump on Saturday afternoon in Florida. Many economists have argued that tariffs could stoke inflation. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Canada and Mexico were quick to announce retaliatory measures across a range of US goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will place 25% counter-tariffs on CAD $155 billion (USD $107 billion) worth of American-made products, starting Tuesday. Stocks are on track for steep losses to start the week, after their rally cooled off on Friday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the plans for imposing tariffs. Trump following through with the extent of tariffs he had initially threatened "may be further" than market participants had been expecting, Evercore ISI chief strategist for international affairs and public policy Sarah Bianci told Yahoo Finance. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as it waits for further clarity on inflation's path toward its 2% target and how potential tariffs could impact that process. The week ahead will bring several key updates for the Fed on the employment side of its mandate. The January jobs report, due out Friday morning, is expected to show the US labor market added 150,000 jobs in the month, down from the 256,000 seen in December. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The report will also include revisions to labor data from the past year. "We suspect the January jobs report will continue to indicate the labor market has softened over the past year, but not to an alarming degree," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients Friday. While the labor market has held up for now, with inflation moving slowly toward the Fed's target, some on Wall Street believe signs of significant slowing would be the most likely catalyst to prompt the central bank to resume its rate-cutting cycle. "We think the unemployment rate is probably the single most important macro data point you're going to get every month," Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance. "If you see a significant uptick in the unemployment rate, that potentially puts the Fed under pressure and puts the market under pressure as well." Less than halfway through the reporting period, the S&P 500 is currently pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, which would mark the fastest rate of growth in three years for the benchmark index. This is higher than the 11.8% growth consensus had expected on Dec. 31, per FactSet data. And FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters points out this reporting season has been a particularly strong one for companies that are surprising Wall Street to the upside with their earnings per share numbers. Analyzing the two days leading into and following a report, companies that beat Wall Street's earnings expectations have seen their stocks rise 1.5% on average. This is above the five-year average of a 1% rise for companies that top earnings estimates. And it's not just this quarter's earnings surprising, either. Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha pointed out in a note to clients that at this point in the quarter, earnings estimates would usually have been cut 1.3%. Instead, they've only been trimmed by 0.6%. In other words, while noise about tariffs, inflation, and the overall path of monetary policy continues to dominate the discussion, the strong trend in earnings continues to be what's keeping Wall Street strategists bullish about the market outlook. "The most steady part of this bull market has been ... those earnings trends. Those forward earnings estimates every week are making new highs," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. "All in all, we think the bull market trend is intact, supported by these earnings that are somewhat still underappreciated." Another bullish sign for earnings may soon be flashing green too. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its ISM Manufacturing PMI. The reading has shown the sector in contraction for more than two years. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave believes the tide may be turning for manufacturing, though. "The manufacturing recession might be over, and we think the ISM manufacturing index is likely to break above 50 in January," Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This could be bullish for stocks, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee recently said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook. "To me, the most important chart to watch is the ISM manufacturing turning up in 2025," Lee said. "This series has been below 50 for 26 months now, the longest stretch since 1989-1991, and we think [it] signals an acceleration of cyclical [earnings] growth in 2025." As Lee's chart shows, when ISM's manufacturing PMI picks up, earnings usually follow. Monday Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, January final (50.1 expected, 50.1 previously); Construction spending, month-over-month, December (0.2% expected, 0% prior); ISM manufacturing, January (49.3 expected, 49.3 prior) Earnings: The Clorox Company (CLX), Palantir (PLTR), Tyson (TSN) Tuesday Economic data: Job openings, December (8.01 million previously); Factory orders, December (+0.5% expected, -0.4% previously); Durable goods orders, December final (-2.2% previously), Capital Goods orders nondefense, excluding air, December final (+0.3% previously) Earnings: Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), AMD (AMD), Amgen (AMGN), Apollo (APO), Chipotle (CMG), Electronic Arts (EA), Enphase (ENPH), Estée Lauder (EL), Ferrari (RACE), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Merck (MRK), PayPal (PYPL), PepsiCo (PEP), Pfizer (PFE), Snap (SNAP), Spotify (SPOT) Wednesday Economic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ending Jan. 31 (-2% prior); ADP Private Payrolls, December (+153,000 expected, +111,000 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, January final (52.8 prior); S&P Global US composite PMI, January final (52.4 prior); ISM services index, January final (54.5 expected, 54.1 prior) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Thursday Economic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, January (+11.4% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 1 (207,000 previously) Earnings: Amazon (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Affirm (AFRM), e.lf.

Title: Trump tariffs, more Big Tech earnings, and a jobs report: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks swiftly recovered from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off early in the week but came under pressure on Monday amid concerns over President Trump's tariff plans. Trump followed through with his plans on Saturday, placing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4. There will be 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China, over issues of fentanyl and illegal migration. Markets are digesting the tariff announcements after a strong start to the year. In January, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 2.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced more than 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 4.7%. In the week ahead, investors will parse the latest developments in Trump's tariff strategy, the January jobs report, and an onslaught of corporate reports. Updates on job openings, as well as activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also be on the schedule. Meanwhile, quarterly results from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Chipotle (CMG), and Eli Lilly (LLY) headline a week that will feature earnings reports from 131 S&P 500 companies. Tariff reaction will be at the forefront of the market narrative in the week ahead. The duties on all three countries will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4, according to the order signed by Trump on Saturday afternoon in Florida. Many economists have argued that tariffs could stoke inflation. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Canada and Mexico were quick to announce retaliatory measures across a range of US goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will place 25% counter-tariffs on CAD $155 billion (USD $107 billion) worth of American-made products, starting Tuesday. Stocks are on track for steep losses to start the week, after their rally cooled off on Friday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the plans for imposing tariffs. Trump following through with the extent of tariffs he had initially threatened "may be further" than market participants had been expecting, Evercore ISI chief strategist for international affairs and public policy Sarah Bianci told Yahoo Finance. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as it waits for further clarity on inflation's path toward its 2% target and how potential tariffs could impact that process. The week ahead will bring several key updates for the Fed on the employment side of its mandate. The January jobs report, due out Friday morning, is expected to show the US labor market added 150,000 jobs in the month, down from the 256,000 seen in December. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The report will also include revisions to labor data from the past year. "We suspect the January jobs report will continue to indicate the labor market has softened over the past year, but not to an alarming degree," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients Friday. While the labor market has held up for now, with inflation moving slowly toward the Fed's target, some on Wall Street believe signs of significant slowing would be the most likely catalyst to prompt the central bank to resume its rate-cutting cycle. "We think the unemployment rate is probably the single most important macro data point you're going to get every month," Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance. "If you see a significant uptick in the unemployment rate, that potentially puts the Fed under pressure and puts the market under pressure as well." Less than halfway through the reporting period, the S&P 500 is currently pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, which would mark the fastest rate of growth in three years for the benchmark index.

Given these dynamics and the volatility in the stock market, it could be difficult for investors to pick the right stocks for their portfolios. Tracking the recommendations of top analysts could be helpful in this regard, as they look beyond short-term noise and focus on companies' long-term growth potential. With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start with streaming giant Netflix (NFLX). The company recently impressed investors with better-than-anticipated results for the fourth quarter of 2024, reporting about 19 million subscriber additions. Reacting to the stellar Q4 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on NFLX stock and boosted the price target to $1,150 from $1,000, saying "NFLX enters the new year firing on all cylinders." Anmuth added that Netflix is gaining from a very solid content slate. While the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight, the Christmas Day NFL games and the second season of "Squid Game" were major content releases in Q4, the analyst noted the company's commentary that these three together accounted for only a small percentage of the overall subscriber additions and that the robust additions were driven by broad content strength. The analyst also highlighted that Netflix is witnessing enhanced engagement per member household and encouraging retention. Reacting to the company's decision to raise prices, Anmuth expects only a little pushback in the U.S. and a few other markets, given the strong content. Looking ahead, the analyst believes that the story this year will shift more towards advertising, with the company gearing up to pursue several initiatives. Overall, Anmuth is bullish on Netflix based on double-digit revenue growth estimates for 2025 and 2026, operating margin expansion, its dominant position in streaming, and expectations of a multi-year rise in free cash flow. He now expects 30 million net additions in 2025 compared to the previous estimate of 21 million. The analyst also increased his revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 4% and raised his operating profit estimate for both years by 13%. Anmuth ranks No. 80 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See Netflix Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. This week's second stock pick is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a pioneer in robotic-assisted surgery and the maker of the popular da Vinci surgical systems. The company ended 2024 on a strong note, with market-beating earnings. However, ISRG's gross margin guidance for 2025 fell short of expectations and indicated contraction compared to 2024. In reaction to the results, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus reaffirmed a buy rating on ISRG stock and increased the price target to $675 from $575. The analyst noted the company's upbeat profitability metrics and explained that the revenue beat was driven by solid gross system placements and procedure growth. In particular, Marcus noted the placement of 174 da Vinci 5 systems in Q4 2024, way ahead of JPMorgan's estimate of 125. "With strong momentum from dv5 heading into 2025 and a setup for another year of beat-and-raise quarters, we remain bullish on Intuitive and reiterate our Top Large Cap Pick," he said. Commenting on the 2025 outlook, Marcus stated that Intuitive Surgical's gross margin guidance of 67% to 68% slightly lagged JPMorgan's and the Street's estimate of about 68.5%. However, the analyst contended that while the gross margin guidance miss triggered some concerns, he sees the outlook as conservative, with a possible upside just as seen in 2024. He highlighted that ISRG's 2024 initial gross margin outlook was 67% to 68%, but it then ended the year favorably with a gross margin of nearly 69%. Overall, Marcus thinks that Intuitive Surgical is well positioned in the rapidly growing, underpenetrated soft-tissue robotics space. He expects the introduction of new systems and approval of the use of ISRG's systems in new procedures to drive future expansion. Marcus ranks No. 683 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.2%. See Intuitive Surgical Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at the cloud communications platform Twilio (TWLO). Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan upgraded TWLO stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $185 from $77 following the company's analyst day event and ahead of the fourth-quarter results in February. "Following multiple years of growth compression and several strategic actions, we believe Twilio is now hitting an inflection point both in terms of narrative and fundamentals," said Rangan, explaining the reason behind his rating upgrade. Further, Rangan expects solid free cash flow generation, supported by Twilio's aggressive cost reduction and efficiency measures. Rangan added that TWLO's analyst day reinforced his optimistic view, thanks to accelerated product velocity and an improved go-to-market strategy. The analyst thinks that enhancements to the company's Communications portfolio can help Twilio expand its already dominant position in the core CPaaS (communications platform as a Service) market. He thinks that following robust Q3 results, there is still notable upside in TWLO stock, driven by the company's strategic actions over the past two years. Also, Rangan sees a possible upside to the calendar year 2025 revenue growth estimates, given inflecting usage trends in communications and new product cross-sell opportunities, backed by core platform enhancements and generative AI innovations. Rangan ranks No. 345 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%. See Twilio Stock Charts on TipRanks.

Title: The Fed Just Confirmed A Huge Crypto Game-Changer As Trump Sparks Bitcoin Price Crash Fears

02/03 update below. This post was originally published on February 2 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stalled after soaring higher following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory—with fears suddenly emerging the $4 trillion crypto bubble could be about to pop. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin, helped by Elon Musk’s leaked plans for crypto in the White House. Now, as one legendary bitcoin trader warns of a looming “financial crisis,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has flung the door open for Wall Street to further adopt bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told banks they are permitted to offer bitcoin and ... [+] crypto to clients as fears emerge the bitcoin price could be on the verge of a crash. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting cycle. Wall Street banks “have to be pretty sure” their bitcoin and crypto activities are “safe and sound," Powell added. 02/03 update: Crypto prices have taken a huge step lower, wiping around $300 billion from the combined market that has been hard hit by the rapidly escalating trade war sparked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s volley of tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from China, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs, due to come into effect Tuesday morning, have also hit global stock markets, with investors balking at the prospect of tighter trading conditions. “A tidal wave of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been unleashed across the cryptocurrency market after U.S. president Donald Trump’s Friday tariff announcement,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive crypto payment platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “The prospect of prolonged higher interest rates has rattled all global markets. While bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark the King of Crypto is once again proving itself to be in a class of its own in marked contrast to altcoins bleeding dark red across the board.” Bitcoin plummeted overnight to just over $91,000, down almost 10% at its lowest, before rebounding to around $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies have seen far steeper declines, with ethereum down around 20% before recovering slightly and Ripple's XRP and ethereum rival cardano trading around similar levels. Solana, ethereum's biggest rival, has fared better, off by just 6% and exacerbating fears among ethereum holders that it could seize the altcoin crown. However, crypto traders have cheered analysis from Bitwise's investment guru Jeff Park, posted to X, who has outlined his thesis on why the coming trade war could be good for bitcoin. “Tariffs might be just a temporary tool, but the permanent conclusion is that bitcoin is not only going higher—but faster,” Park wrote, adding: “While both sides of the trade imbalance equation will want bitcoin for two different reasons, the end result is the same: higher, violently faster—for we are at war.” Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have leaned into bitcoin and crypto over the last year with a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helping to normalize bitcoin and crypto among the financial establishment. Powell’s comments mark a major shift in sentiment under Trump from the previous Biden administration that was hostile toward crypto. Under Biden, bitcoin and crypto companies complained of an unofficial policy to “debank” them, cutting off basic financial services and making it impossible to operate—which became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to a previous U.S. government policy to cut off industries believed to be at high risk of fraud and money laundering. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, topping $100,000 per bitcoin and driving ... [+] the crypto market to around $4 trillion as Donald Trump bets on bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s adoption of bitcoin and crypto—starting with his non-fungible token (NFT) collections, growing to support for a U.S. bitcoin national stockpile and culminating with the launch of a controversial Trump-branded memecoin—has led to regulators and government agencies reversing their opposition to the technology. Meanwhile, Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to put steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, setting the stage for a trade war that could spread around the world. Trump’s executive order will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, and an additional 10% tariff on China, due to go into effect on Tuesday morning. “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash,” Robert Kiyosaki, investor and author of advice book Rich Dad Poor Dad, posted to X, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the catalyst. “Good. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is debt, which will only get worse. Crashes mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” One Community. Many Voices.

The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers' due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn't be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. "It's just getting very hard to make ends meet," Wetherington said. "The way the world is right now, everything's going up, up, up." Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It's also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the "Peak 65 zone." The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. "It's really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now," said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group "can help build key capacity where it's desperately needed." While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America's population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program's "full retirement age" from 65 to 67. "People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits," Quinby said. "That shift triggered a trend in people working longer." Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it's "a bit crazy" that the expectation of retiring at 65 "originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire." Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School's Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it "because they have to." They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can't sustain them. "I call it the tale of two retirements," Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. "The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy," said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra's human resources chief. "They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience." Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. "They're like vintage cars to us," said FedCap's Malatras. "They're built to last, they're full of value, but they're treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don't really have an opportunity to serve anymore." Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren't any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP's pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix's argument for employers is the impending "tsunami" of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don't tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they'll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn't all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there's a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra's sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. "People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams," Tinsley-Fix said. "They really benefit from having those folks." Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they've benefited physically and mentally. "It was the best thing that ever happened to me," said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson's role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That's where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn't for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a "shock" after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. "I don't enjoy not having things I have to do," Sallee said. "I never envisioned the 'sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail' kind of lifestyle." Still, Sallee said she's taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. "If that ever becomes a problem," she said of her yearly stretch of time off, "the vacation will take priority." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

Title: DeepSeek Undermines Robust Earnings And Economic Growth

Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek ... [+] development and President Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) This week is the busiest of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 130 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Four of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with another two coming this week. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek development and President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. The S&P 500 fell 1% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 lost 0.8%. Market Returns Though DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence large language model was released in December 2024, it rattled the technology sector when it became the most downloaded application on the Apple store last week. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. While DeepSeek almost certainly spent more than disclosed and may have utilized others’ intellectual property, their artificial intelligence model seems to provide competitive performance at a lower development cost using less electricity and less powerful semiconductor chips. Because DeepSeek is a Chinese company, its LLM is not likely to be used directly by U.S. companies. Still, it is open-source, so others here will undoubtedly use its innovations to build their models quickly. Before DeepSeek, the development of artificial intelligence was an arms race, with the thought that massive spending on infrastructure, electricity, data, and bleeding-edge semiconductor chips was needed to compete. Nvidia (NVDA) was the most direct beneficiary of this environment, as the company is dominant in providing the most advanced AI chips. The innovations from DeepSeek have opened a new path for lower-cost AI models. While these models are less powerful, they could be offered to customers in a low or no-cost model. This has shifted the balance of market power between the developers and suppliers to large language models, and the companies are utilizing those models internally or offering them to consumers to favor the latter more than previously thought. The most striking example of this shift is the decline in Nvidia (NVDA) last week, while Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) rose. All is not likely lost for companies like Nvidia, however. There should still be robust demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips because the most advanced AI applications will still require that computing power. In addition, the lower the price of artificial intelligence services, the more demand there will be over time. The shift is a reminder of capitalism's creative destruction, especially regarding new technology. DeepSeek - Tech Sector Impact According to FactSet data, the communication services and technology sectors contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Meta Platforms (META) was the most significant contributor to communication services, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) being the most critical contributors to the technology sector. On the other side of the ledger, earnings misses by Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) were the most significant detractors within industrials. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by technology and communications services. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-nine percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% has met expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for communication services and banks, the blended earnings performance improved last week and has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +13.2% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remain the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) reported last week, with all but Tesla besting consensus estimates. Market reaction was more mixed as Microsoft’s cloud earnings growth was disappointing, and the promise of Tesla robotaxis helped cushion the missed earnings. In addition, the DeepSeek introduction added to the difficulty in attributing this week’s price performance to earnings. This week, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) report after the close on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. The forward earnings guidance and implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. Beyond the Magnificent 7, other notable companies reporting are Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), PepsiCo (PEP), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Walt Disney (DIS), and Eli Lilly (LLY). Magnificent 7: Earnings Growth Last week, headline economic growth was reported at a below-consensus 2.3% in the fourth quarter, but the details painted a prettier picture of the economic situation. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which excludes government spending, exports, and any change in inventories, grew by 3.2%, which is evidence that spending by households and businesses remained robust in the quarter. GDP: U.S. Economic Growth As widely expected, the Federal Reserve did not change short-term interest rates. Due to good economic momentum and above-target inflation, the Fed is not expected to alter monetary policy until mid-year. Currently, expectations are for a total of two 0.25% reductions in 2025. The monthly jobs report on Friday will be closely watched as jobs are the canary in the coal mine for economic growth. Struggling economic growth outside the U.S. and the possible impacts of tariffs adds further uncertainty to any outlook. Expected Fed Rate Cuts The earnings from technology and communication services didn’t disappoint, but the story was upended by the DeepSeek news. Two more Magnificent 7 companies, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), report earnings this week, and their earnings and forward guidance will be crucial. DeepSeek shows that the end of the artificial intelligence story has not yet been written so that investors will monitor the situation closely. In addition to being the busiest week of the earnings season, the tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with Friday’s monthly jobs report, could add to the market volatility.

Title: 'Tyranny of high expectations': A veteran investment chief explains why he's quietly cutting exposure to US stocks, even though he's optimistic about the economy and AI

Many of the market's biggest fears may be overblown, though the head of global multi-asset at T. Rowe Price is starting to scale out of US stocks anyway. Investment chief Sébastien Page recently told Business Insider that he's not worried about economic growth, even though fourth-quarter GDP just came in lighter than expected. GDP still more than doubled consensus estimates in 2024, he noted. Corporate earnings, spending, and the unemployment rate also look healthy, and that's before tax cuts and deregulation. It's also too soon to say that China-based DeepSeek's highly effective chatbot will send artificial intelligence spending spiraling, Page said. After speaking with T. Rowe Price's tech analysts, the 25-year market veteran concluded there's no need to panic about DeepSeek. "The economy looks fine, earnings are looking to grow at 15%, and you still have a lot of AI spending that's actually going to increase maybe by 20%, based on our analyst estimates," Page said in an interview. However, Page also said US equities don't look as attractive after a massive multi-year rally. His main concern is the same as it was last fall: Markets are already pricing in plenty of good news. The S&P 500's forward earnings ratio is in the 95th to 98th percentile historically, he noted, but it pales in comparison to that of mega-cap growth stocks. This group's valuations are even more stretched now than they were in mid-November, following the postelection market surge. Even if all goes well with the economy, which Page sees as likely but far from certain, US stocks could fall short of lofty expectations if investors are underwhelmed by earnings. That's why as markets march ever-higher, Page said he's increasingly inclined to take money off the table. "We're still overweight stocks, but we're starting to reduce that overweight," Page said. "We're determining our risk-on positioning. I think as markets continue to rally, we'll continue to fade our overweight to go back to neutral-weight — not get out of stocks completely, just get back to neutral-weight. So that's how we're playing this right now." It's hard to poke a hole in fourth-quarter earnings results, at least so far. Profits have exceeded estimates and are up about 10% so far, according to Bank of America. Big-tech earnings were more of a mixed bag, as Meta pleased investors while Microsoft and Apple had some red flags. While some companies have issued timid forward guidance, the Street thinks earnings will rise at a mid-teen rate in 2025. If analysts are right, stocks could be in for another strong year. "The forecast for the next 12 months is that earnings are going to grow at 15% — that's a high bar," Page said. "So if you want to be an optimist, we can say, 'Look, we don't even need P/E expansion; we don't even need valuations to go higher. If just earnings come through, we can get double-digit stock returns.'" But companies have almost no room for error, Page said, considering where valuations are in the face of interest rates that are now expected to stay at restrictive levels for a longer time. So unless quarterly results meet or exceed an exceedingly high bar, US stocks could take a big hit. "I call it the 'tyranny of high expectations,'" Page said. "Meaning, the expectations for earnings growth are so high that you set yourself up for missing the mark." Cheaper value stocks are among the safest places to be in this expensive market, Page said. The market has fallen by 1% or more 17 times in the last 200 trading sessions, Page noted. In each of those instances, stocks with a value tilt have outperformed their growth-oriented peers, he said. That means value stocks are a better bet during selloffs, and have rebound potential. "Projecting forward 12 months, I would ascribe at least as much upside in value as in growth, given the valuation differential and the broadening fundamentals," Page said. "So to be overweight value I think is an interesting less-downside/same-upside kind of trade." However, that's not to say that the investment chief is bearish on growth stocks. The AI trade isn't over, Page said, as cheaper, better AI can actually cause its adoption rate to accelerate. "I would own both growth and value; tech and non-tech," Page said. "I think we're probably approaching peak concentration. So in our portfolios, we have a slight overweight to value stocks. We think growth stocks are still a very good long-term investment." With that said, stocks in economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials, and materials are strong bets because their valuations are reasonable, and the gap between their earnings growth and those of tech firms is narrowing. The same is true of healthcare stocks, he noted. Outside of the US, investors should stay selective. Page isn't overly bullish on international stocks but said less-heralded markets like Japan, Argentina, and Brazil are worth a look. In short, Page said his best advice for the next 11 months is the same as it usually is. "I don't really like to say, 'Stay invested; stay diversified,' because it's sort of an answer you can give at any point in time," Page said. "If you think about that statement, you could put it on a fortune cookie." But in this richly valued and ever-shifting stock market, that truism rings especially true. "I expect markets to broaden, hence the 'stay diversified,' and I think the economy and earnings will do just fine, hence the 'stay invested,'" Page said. "So when someone asks you in an elevator, 'Hey, you're an investment person,' what should you say? Just say that. And it actually works quite well right now." Jump to

"I don't really like to say, 'Stay invested; stay diversified,' because it's sort of an answer you can give at any point in time," Page said. "If you think about that statement, you could put it on a fortune cookie." But in this richly valued and ever-shifting stock market, that truism rings especially true. "I expect markets to broaden, hence the 'stay diversified,' and I think the economy and earnings will do just fine, hence the 'stay invested,'" Page said. "So when someone asks you in an elevator, 'Hey, you're an investment person,' what should you say? Just say that. And it actually works quite well right now." Jump to

Title: Big Pharma has a big Super Bowl dilemma

Big Pharma often turns to NFL games to hawk their blockbuster treatments, but drug makers have typically been hesitant to advertise during the big game. This hesitation could mean pharmaceutical companies are missing out on a major opportunity to connect with viewers, according to a new analysis by the TV outcomes firm EDO. Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.02%) alone aired a total of 16 commercials for its mega-popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during games in the 2024-2045 NFL regular season, resulting in nearly 283 million impressions, according to data from EDO. Pfizer (PFE-1.05%) ran 10 ads for its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, generating over 147 million impressions. Considering these numbers, you would think prescription drug companies would be jumping to air ads on what is typically the most-watched broadcast in America. Yet, there are a number of reasons drug companies have been reluctant to air ads during the Super Bowl. In addition to cost — a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl has surged to $8 million, viewers generally expect commercials airing during the game to be entertaining and light-hearted. This can be a difficult balance for prescription drug ads to land when they are required to list off all their potential side effects. EDO head of client solutions Laura Grover said that the ads’ big price tag may also not be worth it for drugs that treat conditions with a small incidence rate — a measurement of new cases of a disease over time. “The Super Bowl is a great tool to reach a lot of people at the same time and you do pay a premium for that,” said Grover. “So, if you’re focused on a drug that has a very small incidence rate, it may not be the best investment.” Super Bowl ads can also elevate scrutiny of Big Pharma. In 2016, AstraZeneca (AZN-0.89%) and Daiichi Sankyo bought prominent ad space to market a drug to treat opioid-induced constipation. The White House and at least two police chiefs responded, saying the companies should’ve warned viewers about opioid addiction instead of constipation. Between 1999–2019, the CDC recorded half a million deaths in the U.S. linked to opioid overdoses. For drug makers attempting to cash in on the Super Bowl, the prime ad spot can have a big pay off, especially when it comes to viewer engagement with a brand. “The Super Bowl is a different type of viewing,” said Grover. “People are tuning in for the ads just as much as the game.” Only two prescription drug companies aired ads during last year’s Super Bowl festivities: Pfizer and Astellas, which aired an ad during the pre-game broadcast. Pfizer aired a 60-second spot that promoted the company’s scientific legacy. According to EDO, that ad resulted in one-and-a-half times as much engagement, compared with the median Super Bowl ad between 2020 and 2024. EDO measures engagement by analyzing metrics such as online search activity and website visits after the ad aired. “Because we’re focusing on live linear TV, we know exactly when an ad aired. — — like the actual second when it aired,” Grover explained. “And then we’re tying that to search data that is also down-to-the-second level.” For this year’s Super Bowl, at least two drug companies have already announced plans for commercials during the game. The millennial-targeting telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS+7.01%) is set to air its first-ever Super Bowl commercial advertising its lower-cost weight-loss treatments — including an off-brand version of Wegovy. Novartis (NVS-0.04%) is also airing its first Super Bowl ad. Their ad features actress Hailee Steinfeld and aims to raise awareness for breast cancer and the importance of cancer screenings. “If you have the right drug that has a broader appeal, these live events, NFL, and Super Bowl could be really strong environments for a pharma brand,” said Grover.

It’s going to make us feel sick how much we’ve been ripped off. Giving the keys to the treasury to thieves. Mercy sakes. This is the Bee. Right? Before being appointed by Biden, sinister Nigerian immigrant Adewale Adeyemo was an Obama insider. <><>He was Director of the National Economic Council under Obama <><>he was a Sr Advisor, the Former Chief of Staff, for Blackrock. <><>he oversaw Treasury payment approval <><>He directed that no US Treasury payments be disapproved, even to international terrorists <><>he abruptly quit, and refused to turn in documents <><>he had No apparent congressional oversight <><>he was previously the president of the Obama foundation. <><>did he illegally transfer Treasury monies to the Obama foundation? <><>is this the reason why Obama will not disclose his foundation finances? Thanks to Musk, we’re going to find out how MUCH the Treasury Department stole from the American taxpayers. People are going to prison. Biden really tried hard to destroy our country and he got away with it....makes you wonder why he wasn’t impeached?

DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated. DEI is on its way out, but there is a fetid, hidden cavern where it still thrives unmolested: ESG. Among other things, ESG is a system that assesses and regulates a company's "sustainability", ethics and practices. The Environmental aspect of a company rates and evaluates their levels of pollution, energy and water usage, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions to discern the alleged impact on the environment. This assumes, of course, a deleterious effect on the environment, which cannot be proved. The planet has a way of cleaning itself up. It is within the Social aspect of ESG where the DEI may still hide. That area addresses the relationships between its employees and executives with DEI at the core. The Social aspects also include employee health and safety, customer satisfaction, and (take note) "community engagement", the latter being another way to inject DEI. You can hide an awful lot of DEI in "customer satisfaction" and "community engagement." The Governance aspect of ESG is yet another hiding place for DEI: It monitors and rates an organization's leadership and pay, inner workings, and how shareholders are treated and managed. DEI can invade the "leadership" aspect as well. Why ESG at all? Some investors want to know if a company is responsibly "green" and if they are good stewards and managers of the company. And some investors know that the greener and more woke a company is, the less bang for their buck they will get for that investment. Woke is not dead yet and ESG is a good cave for DEI to hide in until Trump blows over – or so they think. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom knows how harmful ESG is. Here is what they think: Activists are using ESG policies as a cudgel to try to force companies to bend to the will of their political causes. As Heritage Action explains, ESG is being used to “punish” American energy and advance a “‘woke’ cultural agenda … from the boardroom down to the factory floor. This agenda is being pushed by green activists, woke culture warriors, global elites, and the big businesses they control. Over the past two decades, companies all over the world have started abiding by the demands imposed on them by ESG. In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted practices or changed their business policies due to ESG, as well as about 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. But now Americans are waking up to the danger ESG policies pose. A growing number of individuals, groups, and companies are paving an alternative path forward for business. Shoving progressive DEI, ESG, and other woke policies down American throats is nothing new to the hard Left. Take a moment to view this one-minute video titled "ESG hurts" by Heritage Action For America. It's an eye opener, from the "ESG hurts" website: If a company decides not to adopt ESG policies, it risks being de-platformed. So what does adopting ESG policies actually look like? First, if a company wants to boost its environmental score, it needs to go green. Facing pressure from investors, banks, and shareholders, companies are rushing to appear as if they’re doing their part to save the planet. This includes creating policies that appear to address climate change—prioritizing wind and solar energy, limiting waste and water usage, and combating pollution. Second, in order to appear more socially conscious—the “S” in ESG—companies are coerced into educating their employees on critical race theory, supporting radical gender ideology, and adopting pro-abortion policies. The hope is that if a company can prove that it emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, or that it provides travel coverage for employees to access abortions out of state, it will appear more valuable to investors, and hopefully major banking institutions will grant them bigger loans. How a company is ESG-rated on their DEI program, for example, can determine monetary compensation of top executives. If a company shows a high Social (DEI) rating, more wokesters, minorities, and gays can be represented in the highest positions of the company even though they may not be qualified. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam and the founder of Strive, said about ESG: “BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are using the capital of their clients—everyday Americans—to advocate for policies most of them probably don’t agree with.” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, the home state of retail giant Walmart, has a few choice words about ESG: Climate Action 100+ is an elite group of the most powerful ESG investors in America, including competitors BlackRock and JP Morgan. This cartel of competing investment firms actively targets less powerful companies and coerces them into lowering their carbon footprint... This may constitute what is called a “spoke and hub conspiracy.”… ESG is simply bad for working Americans. Underperforming ESG-compliant companies and under-invested fossil fuel companies alike are forced to lay off workers or scale back planned hiring because of ESG. Similarly, companies are forced to slow or freeze wage increases, hurting employed workers. Climate Action 100+ has as part of its policy to "… seek to ensure equality, diversity and inclusion are reflected in the composition of the Steering Committee." ESG is a major DEI hiding place. We Americans hate DEI so much that Donald Trump made it a focus for elimination. He should do the same with ESG. There is no place in a capitalist economy for climate craziness, racist DEI policies, or interference by culture into business, unless the business invites it – at their own risk. The business of business should be business. Period. Image: Pexels // CCO public domain DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated.

Title: Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST): Among the Best Alcohol Stocks to Buy According to Analysts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Alcohol Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stands against the other alcohol stocks. An analysis by Goldman Sachs has revealed that beer and spirits volumes in the American market have shown little correlation with economic growth. This is because beer and spirits are often seen as affordable luxuries or even staples. Liquor tends to enjoy stable sales even when general consumer spending takes a hit elsewhere, while there have also been times when alcohol sales even increase during economic downturns, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Recession of 2008-09. READ ALSO: 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers However, things haven’t been exactly easy for the alcohol sector lately, especially after the recent report from the U.S. Surgeon General claimed that alcohol consumption in the country is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 deaths annually. The report has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The proposition, if enacted, could seriously hurt sales for a sector that is already struggling with a pullback in drinking by younger consumers. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. The growing popularity of low-and no-alcohol products, rising prevalence of cannabis use, and anti-obesity drugs picking up steam certainly haven’t helped either. Another looming threat for the American liquor industry is that of tariffs. The European Union is due to reimpose its retaliatory tariff on American whiskey in late March, but at a higher rate of 50%. Over the last two years, American whiskey exports to the EU have surged by more than 60%, and total US spirits exports grew to a record high of $2.2 billion in 2023. But this success story could face a devastating turn unless President Trump's administration can swiftly negotiate a prolonged suspension or permanent removal of the tariff. However, amidst the sharp decline in sales following the pandemic, one category that could be a bright spot for the struggling booze industry is that of spirit-based RTD’s, despite the fall in the overall spirits segment. Americans consumed over 62 million cases of ready-to-drink spirits in 2023, up almost 25% from 2022, making it the second-largest spirit category by volume, right behind vodka. A plethora of new brands have popped up in the market over the last few years, offering canned versions of many bar classics, including Negroni, Daiquiri, and even the good ol’ Jack & Coke. The alcohol sector also seems to be responding adequately to the evolving consumer trends by investing heavily in a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. Sales of Guinness 0.0, the zero-alcohol version of the highly beloved Irish stout, surged by nearly 50% between February 2023 and February 2024, putting it among the Best Selling Non Alcoholic Beers in the US. Nearly every major industry player has come up with No-Lo versions of their highly acclaimed brands, making sure they don’t miss out on their share of a market that is becoming more and more established every day. To collect data for this article, we examined all the companies in the alcohol sector that are listed on NASDAQ and NYSE and then compiled a list of the stocks with the highest upside potential according to Wall Street analysts, as of January 27, 2024. Following are the Best Alcohol Stocks According to Analysts. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A shelf filled with a variety of bottles of energy drinks, juices, and sodas in a convenience store. Stock Upside Potential: 18.43% Next on our list of the Best Alcohol Stocks is one of the biggest names in the global energy drinks market, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), known for brands like Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. The beverage giant also forayed into the alcohol sector in 2022 when it acquired the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster ownership of CANarchy’s craft breweries, which now operate under the name Monster Brewing Co. Shares of MNST have gained over 46% over the last 5 years, with analysts predicting further gains in the future. A notable aspect of Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is its strategic partnership with Coca-Cola, which has owned an approximate 16.7% stake in the energy drinks company since 2015. This gives Monster access to Coca-Cola's vast global distribution network and provides it a competitive edge in international markets. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has recently been facing challenges in the domestic market, as the energy drinks market in the US continues to struggle. In Q3 of 2024, the company management also pointed to ‘excess inventory levels’ of its Alcohol Brands segment, suggesting slower sales of those products than expected. However, despite these challenges, Monster has managed to outperform its competitors and improve its market share in the US market both in volume and dollar terms, indicating that the company’s brand strength and aggressive marketing strategies are effective in maintaining its competitive edge. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s globalization strategy also seems to be paying off as international sales now account for approximately 40% of its total revenue, reducing the company’s reliance on the tough domestic market. The international emerging markets are particularly attractive for Monster. As disposable incomes rise in these regions and Western consumer trends gain popularity, the demand for energy drinks is likely to go up. However, such aggressive geographical diversification carries its own risks and the energy drinks giant took a significant revenue hit from the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina in Q3 2024. Overall MNST ranks 7th on our list of the best alcohol stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for MNST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MNST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. Apple has a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the latest quarter, the company returned $30 billion to shareholders. The current annual dividend stands at $0.92 per share, yielding approximately 0.39%. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) substantial cash reserves, totaling $68 billion as of June 2024, support its capacity to maintain and potentially increase these returns. Apple’s diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty contribute to its resilience during economic downturns. The significant growth in its services segment, which boasts higher margins, enhances revenue stability. Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best defensive stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Most Promising Dividend Stock According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-inc-avgo-most-promising-201236579.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other dividend stocks. During a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends. Dividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don’t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth. Also read: 8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in According to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan’s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future. The main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment. Since then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters. Investors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it's not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American multinational semiconductor company that offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. In its Q4 2024, the company reported revenue of $14.05 billion, which showed a significant 51% growth from the same period last year. Semiconductor revenue reached an all-time high of $30.1 billion, with AI revenue soaring by 220% compared to the previous year, totaling $12.2 billion. This exceptional growth was driven by the company’s cutting-edge AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. For fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased by 37% year-over-year, hitting a record $31.9 billion. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is drawing considerable attention from investors thanks to its pivotal role in powering products in various sectors, including data centers and smartphones. Its technology supports more than 99% of internet traffic, underscoring its leadership in networking. Furthermore, the company’s acquisition of VMware, a cloud virtualization firm, a year ago has bolstered its market position. VMware's operating margin has now reached 70%, and the company is on pace to surpass its goal of generating over $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA within three years. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) leveraged its robust cash reserves to boost its dividend. In the most recent quarter, the company generated $5.6 billion in operating cash flow and $5.48 billion in free cash flow, accounting for 39% of its total revenue. With 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, Broadcom is considered one of the most promising dividend stocks. The company's per-share dividend comes in at $0.59 every quarter for a dividend yield of 1.07%, as of January 30. Overall AVGO ranks 1st on our list of the most promising dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: This 13% Dividend Is Getting A Makeover. Time To Buy?

MILAN, ITALY - APRIL 10: The logo of American multi-national investment company BlackRock is ... [+] pictured (Photo by Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images) BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund with nearly $2 billion in assets under management — enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. Nvidia (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo — to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ — but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

MILAN, ITALY - APRIL 10: The logo of American multi-national investment company BlackRock is ... [+] pictured (Photo by Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images) BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund with nearly $2 billion in assets under management — enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. Nvidia (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo — to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ — but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

Title: Apple is no longer working on smart glasses to rival Meta
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apples-upcoming-ar-glasses-might-be-dead-water/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T14:30:57Z
Full Content:
It’s been a rumor for some time now that Apple had a pair of AR glasses in development, but a new report from Mark Gurman says the company has cancelled the project. Apple has expressed a lot of interest in the AR/VR space, but its first attempt with the Vision Pro didn’t make the splash the company expected. Its over-the-top price and more professionally-focused applications led to fewer sales and a lot of excess stock. The goal was to create a competitor to the Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, but Gurman says the cancellation comes in the wake of an attempt to change and improve the design of the glasses. The first version of the glasses would link with an iPhone, but its limited power meant applications were limited — and the demands of the device also had an impact on phone battery life. Apple pivoted and focused on linking the glasses with a Mac instead, but that was met with poor evaluations. The development team reportedly dealt with frequently-changing goals, adding to the difficulty, until the project was cancelled. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time Apple has shuttered a project. The company has entertained the idea of a self-driving car for a decade, but Apple gave that project the axe last year. Gurman says Apple also cancelled work on in-house LED displays for the Apple Watch, too. The loss of these projects doesn’t bode well for the future of the already-struggling Vision Pro. Gurman says Apple has a planned successor to the Vision Pro that would improve on the flaws in its original release, although there are employees who “believe there’s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team.” Apple hasn’t completely given up on AR glasses. Several unnamed executives “still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday,” according to the report. Meta doesn’t plan to release its AR smart glasses until 2027, so Apple still has some time to come up with another approach. It would be a welcome addition to the lineup, and a much more affordable way to access Vision Pro-like features. Posts on X are popping up reporting that Microsoft has signed a development and supply contract with Samsung Display for micro-OLED displays. The information originates from a Korean tech site, The Elec, which claims that Microsoft wants "hundreds of thousands" of these displays for an XR device designed for gaming and media consumption. In other words, a competitor for the Vision Pro -- or rather, another competitor for the Vision Pro. There's no doubt that the Vision Pro hasn't exactly been a bestseller. A new report from market analysts indicates that fewer than 500,000 Vision Pro headsets will be sold by the end of the year. However, the report also offers some good news for the future of the platform. According to Bloomberg, citing data from market analyst IDC, Apple is planning a cheaper version of the Vision Pro in 2025, and that could be the company's ticket to a much more popular device, predicting that it could double the sales of the Vision Pro next year. A few years back, I was invited to meet with Apple about its new push into gaming. The company wouldn’t show me a flashy new product to enable that. Instead, it showed me something more modest: No Man’s Sky running smoothly on a MacBook. It looked great, but it wasn’t exactly earth-shattering. It was an independent game from 2016 running on a laptop as well as it had already been running for years on other PCs. I got the sense that I wasn’t there to cover a big development in tech, but rather to see a proof of concept that had bigger plans attached. Years later, those plans are coming into focus even if they still aren’t fully realized yet. I recently attended a repeat of that showcase, only this time I wasn’t just watching an eight-year-old game running on a laptop. I demoed several games, including brand new ones, this time running on a range of devices including the MacBook Air M3 and a 13” iPad Pro M4. While we’re still a long ways away from the App Store being up to snuff with Steam on Windows, I’m starting to see where gaming on iOS is headed -- and Apple is getting there faster than I expected. Growing gaming During my recent session with Apple, I’d get to see and play several games running across iPhone, iPad, and Macbooks. Some of those experiences are more exciting for Apple than for casual players. It’s neat that Resident Evil 7 can run well on an iPhone, but that’s not so surprising when I already know that the much more recent Resident Evil 4 does too. I’m happy to see games like Control and Valheim looking great, but those are existential wins for Apple as it seeks more partners to expand its gaming efforts. I don’t imagine that gamers are jumping to play games that have been out for years on an Apple device (and according to reports, they very much aren’t yet).

Title: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Leading with AI-Powered Cloud and Tranium Investments

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News and Ratings Investors Should Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. As AI continues to reshape industries, investors are closely watching how companies allocate capital during concerns over high valuations. According to some experts, despite market fluctuations, businesses are unlikely to cut AI investments significantly, as the technology’s long-term impact is still unfolding. The comparison to the dot-com era raises questions about sustainability, but many see AI as an innovation cycle that will drive broader economic growth. Marta Norton, chief investment strategist at Empower, believes companies are unlikely to significantly alter their AI-related spending despite concerns over high valuations, especially as DeepSeek raises questions about supply chains. She discussed this on Bloomberg Technology with Caroline Hyde and Mike Shepard, emphasizing that the market is still in an AI investment race and earnings reports will be key in determining future spending patterns. She noted that recent market reactions have been more about valuation concerns than doubts about AI itself. While Nvidia remains central to AI supply chains, the debate is now shifting to whether businesses need to keep spending at the current pace. Comparing the situation to the dot-com era, Norton acknowledged the risks of high valuations but pointed out that major technological shifts, like AI, can drive long-term economic expansion, similar to how the internet transformed industries. On the potential impact of cheaper AI solutions, she suggested that businesses, including retailers and software firms, could benefit from faster, more efficient deployments. However, she cautioned that these effects may take time to materialize rather than being immediately reflected in quarterly earnings. Addressing concerns about broader market disruption, she acknowledged vulnerabilities in major tech stocks but argued that the fundamental case for AI remains strong, with the primary uncertainty revolving around supply chains rather than AI adoption itself. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) incorporates AI across shopping, entertainment, and operations, fueling innovation through investments, AWS collaborations, and Tranium. On January 30, TipRanks reported that Bank of America’s Justin Post reaffirmed a Buy rating on Amazon with a $255 price target. The firm mentioned strong demand for AWS and its expected 19-20% year-over-year growth in Q4. He highlighted Amazon’s investments in infrastructure, including Trainium chips, as key to sustaining future growth. The company’s practice of billing primarily in USD also helps reduce foreign exchange risks, supporting its overall financial stability. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Costco (COST) the Best Defensive Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. In the fiscal year ending September 1, 2024, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) reported net sales of $249.6 billion, marking a 5% increase from the previous year. Comparable sales growth was strong across all regions, with the US at 5.3%, Canada at 5.5%, and Other International markets at 5.7%. E-commerce sales also saw a significant rise of 18.9% during the fourth quarter. Net income was $2.354 billion, or $5.29 per diluted share, compared to $2.160 billion, or $4.86 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The firm has a history of providing stable and growing dividends to its shareholders. In November 2024, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.16 per share, resulting in an annual dividend of $4.64 per share and a yield of approximately 0.49%. Notably, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has increased its dividend for 20 consecutive years, with a dividend growth rate of 13.64%. Overall, COST ranks 8th on our list of best defensive stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of COST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Trump’s $10 Trillion Crypto Bet: Stablecoins To Replace Eurodollars?

PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 16: SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside U.S. ... [+] President-elect Donald Trump and Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce, Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick (L) at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on December 16, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) "I think over the next, call it 20ish years, probably the entire eurodollar market is moving to stablecoins," predicts Austin Campbell, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and CEO of WSPN USA. It's a bold claim – suggesting that a $210 billion market could absorb a system 50 times its size. Yet the prediction becomes more plausible when you understand how the offshore dollar market evolved, and why stablecoins represent its natural digital successor. The modern financial system runs on a form of dollars that most Americans have never heard of. Eurodollars – dollar deposits held outside the U.S. banking system – represent between $10-13 trillion in value. Born in the 1950s as a way for Soviet banks to hold dollars beyond U.S. reach, they grew into the backbone of international finance. Today, they're how Japanese manufacturers pay for Indonesian raw materials and how European banks fund American mortgages. This massive market emerged not through design but necessity. When Cold War politics made direct dollar holdings risky for Soviet institutions, they began keeping dollar deposits in European banks. These banks realized they could lend these dollars without maintaining the same reserves U.S. banks required, creating a more efficient (if less regulated) dollar funding market. Most Americans have never interacted with a stablecoin or a eurodollar, and many struggle to understand their value as they are well served by their domestic banking system. But Americans aren’t the only users of US dollars. A large percentage of dollars serve users outside America. Of the $2.3 trillion in physical U.S. banknotes, the Federal Reserve estimates that 40-75% circulate abroad. Traditional bank deposits show a similar pattern – the $18 trillion in U.S. domestic deposits is comparable to the size of the $10-13 trillion Eurodollar market. These numbers reveal a crucial reality: trillions of dollars already sit outside the U.S. banking system, held by individuals and businesses who need dollars but lack access to American banks. Stablecoins aren't creating this demand for offshore dollars – they're simply providing a more efficient solution for it. Originally stablecoins emerged as digital casino chips for crypto speculators. Just as a casino allows you to exchange dollars for chips that can be used throughout their property, stablecoins let you convert traditional dollars into digital tokens usable across the entire internet. And just like casino chips, their value is backed by real dollars held in reserve – at least in theory. The story of stablecoins can't be told without mentioning Tether (USDT), which remains the largest stablecoin with a market cap of over $100 billion. Founded in 2014 to solve crypto traders' need for a stable trading instrument, Tether's history reads like a thriller. Early controversies about its reserves – which once included commercial paper and mysterious "other investments" – gave way to increased transparency following regulatory scrutiny. Today, Tether primarily backs its tokens with U.S. Treasuries, managed by Cantor Fitzgerald under CEO Howard Lutnick (pictured above) – who is set to serve as Secretary of Commerce. This institutional evolution mirrors the broader transformation of the stablecoin industry from crypto frontier to mainstream finance. Newer entrants like Circle's USDC have taken a more regulated approach from the start. Circle's partnership with BlackRock for reserve management signals the institutionalization of the sector. Yet it is still early days for stablecoins. As analyst Simon Taylor explains, "We're in the dial-up era of Stablecoins, so they're still janky, and connecting is slow and painful. In time, Stablecoins will create an abstraction layer above existing payment rails, just as the Internet did over the telcos." Nevertheless, Taylor's analysis reveals why stablecoins aren't just cheaper – they're fundamentally better infrastructure. Traditional international payments involve a complex web of correspondent banks, SWIFT messages, multiple compliance checks, and days of settlement time. The genius of stablecoins lies in collapsing this complexity into a single layer. A stablecoin transfer is more akin to handing someone cash than initiating a bank wire – but it can happen instantly across borders. Recent research from Castle Island Ventures and Visa reveals the scale of adoption already underway. Stablecoin transaction volumes were estimated at $450 billion per month—roughly half of the just over $1 trillion that Visa processes monthly. Adoption is growing fastest in emerging markets. The study found that 47% of users in developing economies primarily use stablecoins for dollar savings, while 43% cite currency conversion as their main goal. This adoption isn't merely speculative. In Nigeria, where foreign exchange shortages are chronic, stablecoins have become crucial for international trade. As Yellow Card, Africa's largest stablecoin platform notes, "70% of African countries have a FX shortage that has been declared a crisis." The latest evolution comes from yield-bearing variants such as Mountain Protocol. Just as Eurodollar deposits typically offered higher interest rates than domestic U.S. deposits, new stablecoins are finding ways to pass along the yields from their Treasury holdings to users. This development suggests how stablecoins might eventually compete with traditional bank deposits. In his inauguration speech, Donald Trump argued for the creation of an “External Revenue Service” to collect revenue from other countries. Given that stablecoin advocate Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick will be involved in its creation, perhaps the president already had the shift from Eurodollars to stablecoins in mind. The transition from Eurodollars to stablecoins could mark a significant shift in America's global financial power. Eurodollars emerged during the Cold War, when U.S. policymakers saw value in allowing European banks to create dollar liquidity beyond American shores. Today's geopolitical reality is markedly different. In an era of great power competition and economic warfare, the diffuse Eurodollar system may have outlived its strategic utility. Stablecoins offer Washington a chance to recentralize control over offshore dollars. When foreign banks create Eurodollars, they share in the profits of dollar dominance. In contrast, major stablecoin issuers back their tokens primarily with U.S. Treasuries, directly funding American government debt. This shift would align with the more zero-sum view of international relations championed by figures like President Trump, concentrating the benefits of dollar dominance within U.S. borders. The winners in this transition would be concentrated in America: the U.S. Treasury would see increased demand for its debt, while U.S.-based stablecoin issuers would become the new gatekeepers of global dollar liquidity. Users in emerging markets would gain better access to dollars, potentially accelerating global dollarization. The losers would be equally clear: non-U.S. banks would see their Eurodollar business evaporate, while weak local currencies would face even steeper competition from digital dollars. Traditional payment intermediaries would find their business models undermined by more efficient stablecoin rails. Can stablecoins really absorb the $10 trillion Eurodollar market? The better question might be: why wouldn't they? They offer the same basic service – dollar exposure outside traditional U.S. banking – with added benefits of programmability, transparency, and efficiency. The transition won't happen overnight, but as Campbell suggests, the direction seems clear. Just as Eurodollars emerged to meet the 20th century's need for efficient dollar funding, stablecoins are evolving to serve the digital economy's demand for programmable, borderless dollars. The real question isn't whether digital dollars will become ubiquitous, but whether the U.S. will embrace and shape this transition to maintain its financial advantages in the digital age.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: NatWest finalises £450m bonus pot as return to private ownership looms

The bank's annual results will come with the government on the brink of no longer being its single-biggest shareholder after nearly 17 years, Sky News can reveal. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 1 February 2025 11:40, UK NatWest Group is finalising plans to pay out close to £450m in bonuses for last year as it prepares for a return to full private ownership nearly 17 years after its bailout. Sky News has learnt that the bank's remuneration committee is close to signing off the bonus pool ahead of its annual results announcement later this month. The figure of roughly £450m will be about 25% higher than last year's bonus pot of £356m, reflecting NatWest's sharply improved performance in 2024, according to City sources. Shares in the bank, which at one point was more than 80%-owned by British taxpayers, have nearly doubled over the last 12 months. The Treasury has been rapidly reducing its stake in NatWest, with it now standing at just under 8%. This weekend, Sky News can also reveal that the state will cease to become the company's single-biggest shareholder within a matter of weeks, based on the current pace of the government's trading plan, which drip-feeds stock into the market. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, holds a stake in NatWest of roughly 6%, meaning it could replace the Treasury as NatWest's biggest investor as early as this month. Trump latest: President says he wants US to take ownership of Gaza so he can level it for 'jobs and housing' Treasury Committee demands HMRC answers on sanctions regime after Sky News investigation Britain could do slimmed down trade deal with US within months, says former minister That would represent another significant milestone for NatWest's board, chaired by Rick Haythornthwaite. In October, the bank raised its profit outlook after posting a 26% rise in third-quarter income. After its shares closed at 433.1p on Friday afternoon, it now has a market capitalisation of close to £35bn. Last year, Sky News revealed that NatWest was planning to hand its chief executive a potential multimillion pound pay boost as it returns to full private ownership. Lena Wilson, the chair of the bank's remuneration committee has been consulting leading institutional shareholders about an overhaul of its boardroom pay policy, with the proposals to be put to a vote at its spring AGM. Under the plans, Paul Thwaite, who took over as the bank's interim chief executive in July 2023 before being handed the role on a permanent basis in February, would be in line for an increase in his maximum annual bonus from 100% of his base salary to 150%. NatWest also intends to replace its restricted share plan (RSP) for Mr Thwaite, which awarded him stock worth a maximum of 150% of his salary, with a performance share plan (PSP) which could pay him up to three times his basic pay each year. Assuming his salary of just under £1.2m remains unchanged, that would mean him being in line for a maximum reward package - excluding pension contributions and other items - of about £6.6m, up from roughly £4.2m today. The prospective increase would bring Mr Thwaite's compensation more closely into line with peers including Charlie Nunn at Lloyds Banking Group and CS Venkatakrishnan at Barclays - who himself is expected to see his annual pay capped at just over £14m under a new policy. Mr Thwaite replaced Dame Alison Rose after she was forced to step down over the debanking row involving Nigel Farage, the Reform Party leader. Leading City investors who have been part of the consultation process are said to be overwhelmingly supportive of the pay overhaul. Follow our channel and never miss an update. During its previous incarnation as Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank encountered annual controversy over its remuneration - for its chief executives and the wider workforce. In the immediate aftermath of its £45.5bn rescue by taxpayers during the financial crisis of 2008, the pension package of Fred Goodwin, RBS's former chief, and bonuses awarded to his successor, Stephen Hester, became political headaches for the governments of Gordon Brown and David Cameron. In recent years, however, such conflagrations have been defused by a combination of pay restraint and improved performance. Even after the recent recovery in its valuation, taxpayers will see a loss running to billions of pounds from NatWest's emergency bailout. A NatWest Group spokesperson declined to comment.

Title: 5 key investing lessons from recent AI-market mania
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tech-stock-crash-deepseek-lessons-ai-concentration-nvidia-bonds-crypto-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-02-01T10:00:02Z

A new AI model from China rattled US markets this past week. DeepSeek represented a breakthrough for the AI industry, delivering results on par with OpenAI's best model while using significantly less computing power. The implications have been substantial. Nvidia stock shed nearly $600 billion in market value in a single day as investors worried about future demand for its GPU chips, which are the main fuel source for large language models. Suppose large language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta adopt some of the techniques utilized by the open-sourced DeepSeek and become more efficient. Will they need as much computing power as initially thought? On the flip side, AI adopters, particularly software companies, surged on the prospect that the cost of AI technologies would decrease significantly, leading to higher profit margins. But there are even broader lessons investors can take from this week's black swan event, and they impact everything from bonds to stocks and even crypto. The concentration of a handful of mega-cap tech companies dominating the stock market has crept up to historic levels over the past few years. According to Goldman Sachs data, the top five stocks in the S&P 500 made up about 29% of the index as of December 31, and they're all highly exposed to similar technology trends. "Concentration in several large names is a concern when the drivers of success are the same for most of the names," Chris Fasciano, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, told Business Insider. Concentration is a double-edged sword. It can work great in bull markets, but a simple disruption to investors' overarching narrative could lead to a painful decline, as seen on Monday, when the index tracking mega-cap tech stocks plunged 3%, compared to a slight gain for the equal-weighted S&P 500. The concentration speaks to the idea that investors may not be as diversified as they believe. "This is an underappreciated consideration," Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told BI. "It is common — and understandable — for investors to believe that they are adequately diversified when they buy an S&P 500-linked fund," Sosnick said, but that's not the case based on the extreme concentration levels. "Those seeking true diversification need to look beyond SPX," Sosnick said, adding that the Nasdaq is not the answer, with a handful of stocks making up about half of that index. Nvidia has dominated the AI story since ChatGPT was released in November 2022, as it turned into the key "picks and shovels" supplier to companies developing their own large language models. But Monday's price action revealed that there are second-derivative beneficiaries to the AI trade, which includes the adopters of AI technologies like software companies. If DeepSeek's claims of using less computing power are accurate, that means costs should come down considerably for AI adopters, pushing profit margins higher. Among the software winners amid Monday's bloodbath was Salesforce, which gained as much as 10% while the market swooned. "If DeepSeek has truly shown us that an open-source solution is far less resource-dependent than the ChatGPT paradigm, then the benefits of AI might be easier to reap from companies unwilling or unable to afford to partner up with one of the current firms that currently dominate the arena," Sosnick said. Crypto volatility was on full display this week, even though DeepSeek's appeared to mainly impact tech firms. Bitcoin dropped as much as 7%, in tandem with the sharp decline with the Nasdaq 100. The sell-off highlights that cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to moves in the broader tech space, and absent any crypto-specific catalysts, bitcoin is a high-octane bet on tech's continued outperformance of "Safe havens don't have an average daily volatility of 2%," Sosnick said. "Over the past 6 months, the correlation of the price levels of bitcoin and NDX is about 80%." Apple stock bucked the DeepSeek sell-off, rising about 8% in the week as investors determined that the company's decision not to spend tens of billions of dollars on building its own large language model was a good one. Instead, Apple is focused on leveraging ChatGPT's AI model and using edge computing to deliver quick answers to iPhone users. That edge computing is key, as it could become even more ubiquitous if AI models see a decline in their compute consumption thanks to the breakthroughs identified by DeepSeek. And a decline in compute consumption ultimately means a decline in costs, which could fuel even more stock buybacks and dividends for the company. "Cheap AI means a lot more capital to return to shareholders, either in the form of dividends or stock buybacks. Every US Big Tech company except Amazon already has both in place. Now they can get much, much bigger," Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a note this week. If DeepSeek's open-source model delivers the expected cost savings to other large language models, it could ultimately mean higher efficiency and lower costs. According to tech CEOs, like Microsoft's Satya Nadella, cheap AI models should further accelerate the adoption of AI across various industries and lead to a surge in productivity. If that happens, economic growth could continue without sparking a rebound in inflation, which would put interest rates back on a downward trend. "If DeepSeek's processes show that the AI revolution can be achieved at a lower cost and with lower energy usage, that would be good for macro conditions (such as productivity and inflation) going forward," LPL chief strategist Jeff Buchbinder wrote this week. "In theory, this would help reduce the Fed's neutral rate a touch and keep interest rates lower than they otherwise would be if big AI spending continued unabated." Lower interest rates mean higher bond prices, sparking a potential rally in an asset class that was hurt by the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. "More egalitarian AI can and should boost productivity throughout the economy and thus have benefits for price levels and interest rates," Sosnick said, though he cautioned that such an outcome is "not going to happen immediately."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other beginner-friendly stocks. Uncertainty sweeps across the US with the incoming administration’s potential policies. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump's trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows: "Everything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets" Recently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s, or Meta’s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build. The event raised a lot of concerns over America’s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China’s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek’s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple’s App Store demonstrates the country’s rapid gains in the sector. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading e-commerce company that has grown in a variety of businesses such as its core e-commerce operations, cloud services, as well as digital advertising. Additionally, Amazon manufactures and sells electronic devices such as Kindle, Ring, Blink, Fire tablet, Fire TV, and Echo. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) serves as a global leader in e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming. The company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its most recent quarter, with Amazon’s cloud and advertising units showing strong growth. Ahead of the new earnings for Q4 2024 which are to be released on February 6, several Wall Street firms agree the e-commerce and cloud giant boasts the strongest setup among the mega-cap tech companies going into the earnings season, as reported by CNBC. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $275. On January 24, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also got a Buy rating from Scotiabank’s Nat Schindler. Lisa Schreiber from Gradient Investments emphasized Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) being one of her top picks for 2025 as follows: “It’s the leader in online retail and is very well-diversified with its cloud-based business, where it’s also a leader. Additionally, its ad business is gaining momentum and doing very well. Together with the fact that the path to AI monetization seems clearer for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compared to other big names, we just have to recall their latest commentary around their cloud business, where they plan to introduce their own AI chip, which could potentially rival Nvidia down the road. The introduction of their AI agents is also increasing efficiency in their online retail. I think all of that presents great opportunities for 2025.” Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other long term low risk stocks. As the DeepSeek craze ignites a sell-off in the tech sector, investors are weighing the implications of the downturn in the long term. This is because the technology sector, particularly the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, has been a significant driver of market gains in the past few years. However, Bank of America strategists caution that these tech giants may face challenges ahead, dubbing them the "Lagnificent 7" due to potential underperformance. Factors such as diminishing US exceptionalism, vast fiscal spending, high immigration, and the AI investment bubble are cited as contributing to this anticipated slowdown. The bank has advised investors to explore undervalued opportunities in sectors like Japanese and European banks, commodities, high-yield bonds, international stocks, and cyclical sectors, given expected rebounds in global manufacturing activity. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. There are also several long term and low risk equities trading on the US stock market that could provide investors with the hedge they need against volatile tech stocks. According to a report by news agency Reuters, looking ahead, investors are cautiously optimistic about 2025, anticipating gains fueled by a solid economy, moderating interest rates, and pro-growth policies from the incoming administration. The S&P 500 has experienced significant growth over the past two years, and corporate profits are projected to rise by over 10% in 2025. However, risks such as persistent inflation, potential policy shifts, and elevated stock valuations warrant careful consideration. Strategies may include diversifying portfolios, focusing on undervalued sectors, and closely monitoring economic indicators to navigate the evolving landscape. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Mixture-Of-Experts AI Reasoning Models Suddenly Taking Center Stage Due To China’s DeepSeek Shock-And-Awe
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2025/02/01/mixture-of-experts-ai-reasoning-models-suddenly-taking-center-stage-due-to-chinas-deepseek-shock-and-awe/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T08:15:00Z
Full Content:
Mixture-of-experts LLM structure becomes super-hot as a result of the DeepSeek AI release. In today’s column, I examine the sudden and dramatic surge of interest in a form of AI reasoning model known as a mixture-of-experts (MoE). This useful generative AI and large language model (LLM) approach has been around for quite a while and its formulation is relatively well-known. I will lay out for you the particulars so that you’ll have a solid notion of what mixture-of-experts is all about. The reason MoE suddenly garnered its moment in the spotlight is due to the release of DeepSeek’s model R1 which uses MoE extensively. In case you haven’t been plugged into the latest AI revelations, DeepSeek is a China-based AI company that has made available a ChatGPT-like LLM. They also made a bold claim that the AI was devised at a significantly reduced cost, causing quite a pronounced stir since the bulk of USA AI efforts assume that only vast and costly amounts of hardware could produce such a capable model. Hardware provider Nvidia took a big hit in their stock price and most of the major USA AI firms also saw their stocks get punished. If you are interested in whether we need to keep scaling up or whether maybe we need to work smarter when it comes to advancing AI, see my in-depth analysis at the link here. I will focus my discussion here on the overall nature of the mixture-of-experts approach, including how it has both key advantages and disadvantages. That being said, please know that the DeepSeek AI system is said to have also leaned heavily into the use of knowledge distillation, which I’ve covered extensively at the link here. The idea is that you can rapidly bring a new AI system up to speed by using an existing fully capable one to transfer or train the newbie lesser model. Some assert that if DeepSeek took that route, in a sense they were “cheating” in that they relied on someone else’s existing model to parlay their instance into existence (see my discussion about the ethical and legal intellectual property or IP rights issues that arise, at the link here). Another factor of their AI approach is that they extensively utilized reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which I’ve covered at the link here. The star of this show is mixture-of-experts or MoE. Let’s talk about it. This analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here). The mixture-of-experts approach traces its roots back to the early 1990s and I will toward the end of this discussion share with you some fascinating quotes from a now-classic AI research paper that got the ball rolling on this innovation in 1991. By and large, the core facets are still true today. The core is what I’m going to introduce to you. To get things underway, I am going to provide a simplified version of MoE. I say this to try and avoid getting harangued by trolls who will be distraught that I won’t be portraying the mathematical and computational complexities. Those nitty-gritty details are certainly valuable, and indeed, I will provide references throughout where you can readily learn more on the matter. Here’s the deal. The most common way to devise generative AI consists of designing the internal structure or architecture as one large monolith. Any prompt that a user enters will essentially be routed throughout this massive byzantine structure and have zillions of touchpoints as it progresses and is processed. This is easy to devise, somewhat easier to maintain, and generally works pretty well. An alternative approach is to decide that we will divide up the monolith into respective parts or components. Each component will have a specific purpose. The AI parlance is to say that these components are “experts” and that we are dividing up the processing into occurring across a multitude of these experts. I personally disfavor the use of the word “expert” to refer to the components since this tends to anthropomorphize the AI, as though it is a set of human experts. Each component is merely devoted to some area of interest, and I would say are specialized in what they can suitably process. Anyway, the word “expert” is catchy and has become the default terminology in use. The bottom line is that the mixture-of-experts approach consists of deciding beforehand that when you create a generative AI or LLM you will divide it up into some number of components that we’ll say are experts. Doing so has some exciting properties that can boost the AI in comparison to the run-of-the-mill monolithic route. Handiness Of A Bundle Of Experts The good news about mixture-of-experts is that you can hone the AI to be adept in specific areas or domains. For example, suppose I wanted to ask generative AI some questions about various U.S. presidents, in particular, let’s say Abraham Lincoln. A monolithic AI structure would take my prompt and feed my question about Honest Abe to the entire landscape of the AI system being utilized. Here and there, various bits and pieces about Lincoln might be touched upon. Eventually, it is hopefully brought together by the AI and presented to me as a cohesive answer to my question about Lincoln. In the case of MoE, we might have set up the LLM on the basis of “experts” that are components devoted to specific presidents. There is a component about Lincoln. A different component concentrates on George Washington. And so on. My prompt asking about Abraham Lincoln would get routed to the Honest Abe component. This component derives a response to my prompt. The response is then presented to me. Voila, easy-peasy. Note that a crucial element of the MoE is that the prompt by the user must be carefully parsed by the AI to suitably identify which expert ought to be activated. Suppose that I asked about Abraham Lincoln, but the AI sent my prompt to the component on George Washington. Sad face. Not where my prompt should have gone. Now then, in theory, the George Washington component would detect that the prompt is about Lincoln and then pass the request either back to the routing function or directly to the Lincoln component. You might say that the gateway or gating of the mixture-of-experts is a make-or-break activity. When a prompt comes in, the gateway had better do a decent job of figuring out which expert should get the request. If the wrong expert is selected, this could be a waste of time and effort. Worse, the wrong expert might try to generate an answer. Imagine my surprise if the AI responded with details about George Washington rather than Honest Abe. The gating has to be reliable; it has to be quick since otherwise time is unduly consumed, and it is also a kind of bottleneck. The positive aspect is that your prompt is likely to end up at the right place in the fastest time in comparison to the meandering monolith approach. The negative aspect is that your prompt might get misrouted and ultimately even produce a wrong or inappropriate response. Just another tradeoff in the harsh world we live in. Seems like you can never truly eat your cake and have the icing too. To showcase how this works, let’s assume that you are using generative AI to help diagnose what is wrong with your car. Your car has been making some oddball noises lately. There doesn’t seem to be any obvious basis for the noise. You log into a generative AI app that is made via a monolith-oriented architecture. The AI has various automotive mechanic capabilities spread around in the overall structure but there aren’t specific components devoted to say the engine, the transmission, etc. Here we go. As you can see, the AI is spreading your request across the landscape of the AI and merely generically seeking car mechanic portions. You decide to log out of the AI and instead log into a mixture-of-experts or MoE-based model. Here’s what happens. You can now see that the AI first used a gateway function that was labeled as a car diagnostician. This overall component decided that the specialized component or “expert” on engines would be the best place to route the request to. Sure enough, the engine expert said that the problem is with the engine. Let’s use the same example and this time the engine expert says that the engine isn’t the culprit making the oddball noise. You can see that the engine expert reported back to the gateway. The gateway then opted to make another guess and routed the request to the transmission expert. Luckily, this was the right final place to land in. Depending upon how the MoE is shaped, sometimes you won’t realize that the various so-called experts within the AI are being consulted. There isn’t necessarily a need for you to know what took place during the processing of your prompt. All you probably care about is that you get a solid answer to your prompt. Thus, another purpose of the gateway is often that it routes internally, collects what is being generated by the internal structure, and aggregates it into the final response that you ultimately see. Everything else is hidden from your view. Here’s what that might be like. In this instance, the gateway carried on an internal conversation with the various AI experts. Once a resolution was devised, the gateway aggregated the results and was ready to present the recommendation to the user. For an AI maker or developer, a big challenge when leaning into a mixture-of-experts approach is what the various experts or components will be focused on. You usually must decide this upfront. Once you’ve made that decision, the structure is somewhat locked into place. Suppose I opted to go with components focused on USA presidents. A user comes along and wants to ask about USA governors. Oops, my LLM wasn’t structured on that basis. At that juncture, it could be that I have set up only some experts and allowed a semi-monolith for the rest of the structure, and I will then route the prompt to that monolith portion. You could argue that this is not too bad since that’s what would have happened in a pure monolith structure, on the other hand, the experts aren’t being of much advantage if that happens quite a lot. Another notable design question is how many experts to have. Should I have experts per president, and then experts per vice president, or maybe just have experts that each cover a pair of a president and their associated vice president? This is a tough aspect to decide at the get-go. Generative AI is data trained by scanning the Internet and pattern-matching on human writing. The good news about MoE is that you can direct the scans toward the areas that pertain to the experts or components that you’ve decided upon. This can expedite data training. A downside is that you need to figure out whether the components or experts are getting sufficient data training. When you do things for a monolith, you at times just let the data training go as long as you can afford to do so or run out of data for training purposes. The MoE is usually best undertaken by assessing how deep and sufficient the components are during the initial data training. The upshot is that data training requires a different semblance of perspective depending upon whether you are data training an underlying monolith LLM or a MoE model. Lots more twists and turns come into the picture. Some advocate that MoE should have shared experts along with dedicated experts. This involves deciding that there will be specialized components that any of the other experts can use versus ones that are only to be used by say the gateway. The beauty of having multiple experts or components is that you can potentially leverage parallelization during the processing of a prompt. Envision that I wrote a prompt asking about both Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. In a conventional monolith, this is clunkily floated around to figure out which bits and bytes have something relevant to generate. With MoE, the gateway could split the prompt into two pieces, routing one piece to the Lincoln expert and the other piece to the George Washington expert, having both components working simultaneously on my prompt. Nice. Speed can be a great outcome of using MoE. A troubling aspect though can at times arise. The gateway might start to overuse some of the experts. Those particular experts become excessively relied upon. The AI gets sluggish. An important ongoing chore might be to monitor the spread of the usage and have some form of balancing algorithm to try and get things evened out if feasible. If you are intrigued by the MoE approach, you might enjoy the now-classic AI research paper that many attribute to having gotten this line of architecture underway (please know that prior papers also postulated and examined the topic). The paper is entitled “Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts” by Robert A. Jacobs, Michael I. Jordan, Steven J. Nowlan, and Geoffrey E. Hinton, Neural Computation, 1991, and made these salient points (excerpts): The emphasis is that generative AI and LLMs typically make use of artificial neural networks (ANN) as the underpinning of the AI, see my explanation about such neural networks at the link here. You can create a humongous artificial neural network as one massive monolith or divide it into subnetworks. Those subnetworks are the components or experts of the MoE structure. As mentioned earlier, doing so can make processing faster, which in AI parlance you say that the “inferencing” is sped up. Furthermore, again in AI parlance, the usual feed-forward network (FFN) layers are essentially replaced with MoE layers. Each MoE layer usually makes use of one or more experts and has at least one gating function. DeepSeek’s AI makes use of mixture-of-experts, as do several other high-profile LLMs such as Mixtral by Mistral, NLLB MoE by Meta, and others. No one can say for sure whether MoE is the best or optimum way to devise generative AI. I’ve noted that it has upsides and downsides. It isn’t a silver bullet. The shock and awe of DeekSeek’s AI will certainly cause a rapid and wider pursuit of mixture-of-experts. Some will rush to include it. Others will be dubious and argue that the downsides outweigh the pluses. All in all, we are in for exciting times. Let’s give the last word for now to Aristotle: “Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives -- choice, not chance, determines your destiny.” We will have to wait and see whether MoE is a choice, a chance, or a destiny.

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from DeepSeek rocking the AI world to Garmin's major outage

Here's your firmware update for February 1, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week was wild. DeepSeek came and changed the AI landscape, but it seems like the full impact of its arrival is still yet to be fully understood. Meanwhile, Garmin accidentally bricked many of its devices globally thanks to an errant update, and Android XR broke cover in our first hands-on look at the software. Al that and more of the other big tech news stories you might have missed from the week are recapped below, so you can catch up with everything then get on with your day. Plus, if you're after a way to spend your downtime this weekend, then don't forget to check out our picks for the 7 new movies and TV shows to stream this weekend. It’s been a rollercoaster week for the AI industry, with the DeepSeek app rocketing to the top of the Apple App Store and beating ChatGPT. DeepSeek is a Chinese startup who claim to have developed their deep reasoning model, R1, for a fraction of the price that US AI companies have invested in their technologies. It also offers people access to it for free in its chatbot and at a much reduced price as an API compared to OpenAI. The news that a Chinese company can produce an equivalent technology for a fraction of the price caused a complete crash of the share value of US tech companies that are heavily invested in AI. Nvidia came off particularly badly, with $600 billion being wiped off their stock value in just one day. Share prices have since recovered, but it doesn’t feel like the AI market will ever be the same again. Questions are already being asked about how DeepSeek managed to produce its AI model so quickly, especially after OpenAI claimed it had evidence of distillation of some of its models. Distillation is a development technique where you piggyback off another model’s learning, but is against the OpenAI terms and conditions of use. To make matters worse for DeepSeek, it appears that when questioned about which AI model is best, DeepSeek will sometimes refer to itself as ChatGPT, which some users consider a smoking gun. OpenAI released a statement on the matter, saying: “We know that groups in the PRC are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to try to replicate advanced U.S. AI models. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. "We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more. We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here.” This one may rumble on for a while yet. A tough few months of software quirks boiled over into a massive Garmin outage this week that saw users in their thousands completely lose access to their devices. A rogue GPS file accidentally pushed to Garmin wearables saw watches and trackers plunged into a boot loop dubbed the 'Blue Triangle of Death.' Few customers found they could escape, and even those who did encountered further issues with connectivity and synchronisation. The outage lasted well over 24 hours and we heard from hundreds of customers – owners of devices such as the Forerunner and Epix ranges, as well as more niche devices including Garmin's dive computers, cycling computers, and Approach Golf Range. Garmin has since fixed the underlying issue, but there are reports that some customers remain stuck in boot loops and without a device. Plenty have even told us they regret their Garmin purchases or plan to depart for companies like Apple. It's a PR disaster that has overshadowed the launch of the Instinct 3, and Garmin has some recovery work to do if it wants to avoid a Sonos-style scenario. Nvidia’s new graphics cards are here and… and they’re already gone, with stock sold out across the internet in lightning-fast time. Some of these highly sought-after GPUs will have been bought by legitimate gamers looking to upgrade their rig – and they’re in for a treat, with our RTX 5090 review highlighting that it’s a seriously powerful upgrade that approaches complete overkill performance. Our RTX 5080 review, meanwhile, reports that it boasts some solid gains at a more modest (but still not inexpensive) price. Unfortunately some Nvidia cards also seem to have been picked up by scalpers taking advantage of the limited availability to flip them for a profit on resale sites by listing the GPUs for several times their MSRP. Resale sites have also been flooded with listings that seem to be selling the new GPUs for prices closer to what they should cost – but when you take a closer look, you’ll see they’re promising to send you a picture of the graphics card you desire, rather than the real thing. So, our advice is to wait for another official drop so you don’t get tricked by a scammer or pay three or four times more for the GPU you’re after – and you can follow our live Nvidia RTX 5090 stock updates and Nvidia RTX 5080 stock updates trackers for info on when and where these drops will happen. Nothing shared a short video of its CEO Carl Pei this week. Normally that wouldn’t be super newsworthy, but as the camera zooms in on his glasses we see the words “Launch 4 March” reflected in the lens. A previous Nothing Phone 3 teaser suggested this would be the announcement date for its next smartphone, but now it’s all-but certain. What’s more interesting is a cut in the middle of the clip that seems to shift from a shot from a wide lens, to one from a telephoto lens – the latter of which is absent from previous Nothing phones. We’re taking this as a hint that the Nothing Phone 3 could have a triple-lens camera – with a telephoto camera joining the wide and ultra-wide lens setup found on the Nothing Phone 2. Thanks to a hands-on video from Marques Brownlee on his YouTube channel, MKBHD, we got our first look at Android XR and the Project Moohan prototype this week. While many details including price, release, and some specs are still a mystery, we did get to see aspects of the headset’s design and software. It looks a lot like a combination of the Meta Quest Pro and Apple Vision Pro. There’s no over-the-head strap but instead a Meta Quest Pro-like adjustable strap round the back, and the Android XR headset borrows the Quest’s optional light blockers to change between a VR-optimized and MR-optimized design. It also uses an external battery pack like the Vision Pro to help save weight. As for software, Brownlee’s video predominantly focused on Gemini’s integration – which looks impressive. Though many of the AI features look like they’d be much better suited to a pair of AR glasses, so while we expect Moohan will be impressive, we’re already waiting to see what XR hardware Samsung and Google will launch next. Our favorite wall-crawling superhero is finally back! The latest adaptation of Peter Parker to enter the fray is in Marvel’s new animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. The show has a unique release schedule, though, as each week two episodes will be released instead of one – the first two of which debuted on Disney Plus this Wednesday (January 29). TechRadar’s senior entertainment reporter Tom Power has already seen all 10 episodes and says the show’s “a spectacularly fun ride” in his Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man review. Which is great news for Spidey fans, because two more seasons have been greenlit and the show’s creator already has “big ideas” for where it could go next.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Must-See AI News and Ratings You Might Have Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) stands against other must-see AI news and ratings you might have missed. Northland Securities recently issued a rating for a stock amidst the DeepSeek AI frenzy. The firm noted that it isn’t concerned about the AI models just yet and that it doesn’t expect big tech giants to cut their capital expenditures when they report their earnings either. In light of this, the CEOs of tech giants such as Meta and Microsoft have recently defended their massive spending, noting how it was crucial to stay competitive in the new field. Investors panicked after news spread over the weekend about a Chinese startup DeepSeek having released AI models that were built using less power and chips. In response, executives of tech giants are saying that building huge computer networks has been crucial to serving growing corporate needs. Even then, investors have been losing their patience with the huge amounts of spending and a dearth of hefty payouts. READ NOW: These 29 AI Electricity and Infrastructure Stocks Are Crashing Due to DeepSeek News and 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz DeepSeek has been causing a stir in the AI world and refuted the gap that previously existed between the AI capabilities in China and the US. After the first Chinese version of ChatGPT was released, there was a lot of disappointment in China considering it was not on par with ChatGPT. However, DeepSeek’s AI models have shifted the AI narrative completely. Not only has it sparked a frenzy in the US, but even its domestic competition has been pressurized. This was made evident when Alibaba released a rival to DeepSeek’s model on the Lunar New Year. According to the company, the “Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms … almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B”. Even though DeepSeek’s AI models have been impressive, there is still skepticism and confusion regarding the demand for high-end AI chips and the need for power to run AI-centric data centers. “There’s plenty of uncertainty over what the true demand for state-of-the-art chips, semiconductor fabrication plants and energy will be”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a circuit board with components depicting the intricate electronic componentry products the company produces. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) offers a range of product manufacturing and related supply chain services. On January 30, Barclays raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $139 from $91 and kept an “Overweight” rating. The rating has been issued following quarterly results. According to the firm, investors are valuing Celestica based on 2026 projected earnings, driven by the demand for specialized chips called ASICs which remain a medium-term trend. In particular, 2026 captures the run rate revenue of the TPUv6, Google’s latest generation AI accelerator. The firm further noted that Meta Platforms aims to launch a new ASIC program that could compete with the TPU program in terms of expertise and capability. Overall, CLS ranks 6th on our list of must-see AI news and ratings you might have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of CLS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CLS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

"Is DeepSeek an alternate universe that bodes terribly for Nvidia's pricing down the road? Hey, anything's possible," he said. "But if you had to design the most punitive way to bring down the price of this great stock, you'd invent something like DeepSeek." Earlier this week, investors were stunned to find out DeepSeek developed an AI model that it said cost $6 million to make — significantly less than what its peers spend on such programs. The company also claimed that the model could outperform that of industry favorite OpenAI. Wall Street concluded Big Tech may not need to spend as much money on highly-advanced chips from Nvidia, which until now seemed like the only option for companies looking to dominate in the AI world. Worries of lower earnings sent Nvidia shares plummeting, with the stock losing nearly $600 billion in one session, the largest single-day drop in market history. Cramer conceded that investors' response is logical if DeepSeek's model actually cost so little to make, forcing Nvidia to bring down prices. But he said there's a possibility that DeepSeek spent more on its program than investors believe, referencing a new report from SemiAnalysis, a semiconductor research and consulting firm. SemiAnalysis suggested the way DeepSeek framed the development of the new model is misleading, saying the company could have actually spent more than $500 million. Cramer was also skeptical that executives at tech giants like Meta, Tesla and Oracle would have invested so much money in Nvidia without performing proper due diligence. DeepSeek wasn't a secret, he continued, it just received a lot of attention this week. "I think the SemiAnalysis piece is spot on," he said. "It may just be one more long knife aimed at Nvidia, and nothing more." Nvidia declined to comment. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Title: “Made In America” Is Easier Said Than Done
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/31/made-in-america-is-easier-said-than-done/

Bringing manufacturing back to the United States, colloquially known as nearshoring, is poised to significantly reshape trucking and rail networks across North America. The push for localized supply chains promises shorter delivery times and reduced geopolitical risks, but it also brings challenges in infrastructure and logistics. The companies solving these challenges are going to be critically important and could be an investment opportunity. Nearshoring offers two big advantages and a few smaller challenges. First, it can help companies avoid tariffs and FX headaches. Second, it can shorten lead times and improve inventory management. Trump’s original push for tariffs and COVID-19’s supply chain shock have made a strong business case for bringing manufacturing back to the United States, but the cost of manufacturing domestically is higher than manufacturing abroad. However, having confidence that your supply chain can deliver and not having to deal with political spats carries significant value. Unfortunately, the higher costs associated with manufacturing domestically generally need to be passed on to the consumer. Higher prices for some goods are tolerable, but if it’s broad-based then it can be inflationary. An additional challenge is that the United States currently faces some constraints on manufacturing. Labor is one – we addressed it last month here – and transportation is another. Put simply, we need our domestic logistics to level up to accommodate a push for more manufacturing at home. Aerial view of cars at the Volkswagen plant in Puebla, Mexico, on August 4, 2018. - Mexican ... [+] President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's advisers on August 27, 2018 hailed a new trade deal with the United States, saying it represented progress on energy and wages for Mexico's workers. (Photo by Jose Castanares / AFP) (Photo credit should read JOSE CASTANARES/AFP via Getty Images) Mexico has become America’s largest trade partner, recently overtaking China as the top exporter to the United States. It is well positioned geographically and broadly has lower wage costs and a greater supply of labor for factory-level jobs than the United States. U.S. companies have invested significant capital in Mexico over the past several decades and many companies send parts back and forth from the U.S. to Mexico for different parts of the manufacturing process. Canada’s geographic proximity has also made them a critical trade partner for the U.S., but mainly in the realm of natural resources. Crude oil, liquefied natural gas, lumber, and other mined commodities consistently supply US markets. North American trade has become increasingly interwoven and has accelerated as scrutiny on China has mounted. According to the Brookings Institution, the U.S. imported $472.5 billion of goods and services from Mexico while Canada imported $15.6 billion worth of goods. The United States also accounts for over 40% of Mexico’s imports. This partnership is bidirectional and has led to gains for both the United States and Mexico. Generally speaking, Mexican manufacturing shouldn’t be seen as a direct competitor to American manufacturing but rather as a complement. Mexican factories use parts imported from the U.S. and vice versa; corporations have allocated capital across both countries to drive manufacturing efficiencies in an attempt to remain competitive with low-cost goods from China. While investing in Mexico means navigating complicated labor laws and exposure to cartel crime, the low-cost labor makes it a necessary input for effective North American manufacturing. The degree to which companies can nearshore and access cheap labor in Mexico is important because it impacts the mix of goods that can be effectively manufactured outside of China. High-value goods like electronics and automotive components can be manufactured and sold domestically with cheaper labor in Mexico and capitally intensive factories in the United States combining to offer a competitive product. Potential shifts in U.S. import policy, specifically with regards to tariffs on Mexico and Canada could jeopardize this balance. The ability to manufacture efficiently in the United States could actually take a hit if we make trade with Mexico and Canada more difficult. Consequently, while we are broadly optimistic on North American manufacturing, we’d shy away from trying to pick winners or losers who might be impacted by tariffs or trade disputes. Instead, we would suggest focusing on investment opportunities in companies who facilitate trade and transport unfinished components and final goods to their points of sale. The economy is strong and nearshoring has momentum, so the space is probably worth a look. 370225 03: Tractor-trailer rigs are parked at the Petro truck stop May 29, 2000in El Paso, TX. Many ... [+] of the rigs now have modern wireless communications as well as cable television, refrigerators, double bunk beds, and microwave ovens. In the last few years trucks have become more like a home/office on the road. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers) The value of U.S. freight by truck with Canada and Mexico has steadily increased since the mid-2000’s and amounts to over $70 billion as of December 2023, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. With nearshoring comes shorter supply chains, and an increase in the need for valuable truck space, meaning trucking fleets need to navigate the shifting trade landscape to accommodate retailers’ just-in-time inventory approach. With trucking, the two general approaches to shipments are full truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) – the latter meaning a single truck carries shipments from multiple customers and the former meaning all goods in the container are destined for the same location for the same customer. Generally, LTL shipments are more expensive on a per-unit basis but offer manufacturers greater flexibility in getting finished goods to retail customers or storage warehouses. Instead of committing and paying up for larger shipments that take up entire truckloads, companies can have goods shipped with smaller, more frequent LTL runs which allow for quick inventory adjustments. These quicker adjustments are helpful during labor strikes or supply chain disruptions. LTL shipments account for just about 10-15% of the industry’s volume today, but the rise in e-commerce and necessary shorter transit times presents a compelling investment opportunity for trucking firms down the road. Companies like FedEx Corp. (FDX) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. (ODFL), who specialize in LTL shipping, dominate the market and offer solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises that don’t have the scale to fill up whole truck beds with raw materials or finished products. Conversely, the FTL industry is highly fragmented and relies heavily on brokerage firms to match shippers with small and mid-size carriers. According to RXO Inc (RXO), the top 15 FTL carriers combine for less than 10% of total market share. More than 95% of carriers operate 10 trucks or less! Although still critically important for the food, pharmaceutical, and consumer goods industries, it’s a heavily diluted market with minimal barriers to entry. Artificial intelligence and technological innovation are coming for the trucking industry. Something as simple as improving routing could lead to significant cost savings. Technology enabling the real-time tracking of vehicles, predictive maintenance, and dynamic route adjustments based on traffic or weather conditions could all lead to bottom line improvements. Better routes and more well-maintained trucks reduce fuel consumption, repairs, and idle/empty drive times. Firms with enough capital to own trucking fleets and invest in technology, like XPO Logistics (XPO), can also integrate trucking fleets with warehouse management systems to streamline order processing and reduce downtime. Technology can also help tackle regulatory complexity. Importing goods from Mexican maquiladoras, factories that import materials and export the finished goods, requires expertise in customs and border clearance. Facilitating the clearance of goods through U.S. customs and navigating documentation, duties, and inspections means third-party logistics firms like C.H. Robinson (CHRW) with integrated customs brokerage services are crucial for nearshoring to succeed. Finally, the United States is facing an acute shortage of truckers, especially those who are interested in long haul journeys. The adoption of automated driving for semi-trucks would be huge for the industry. Regional routes often involve repetitive patterns and well-defined paths, making them ideal candidates for early implementation of autonomous driving systems. These systems can handle highway driving and reduce driver fatigue, while allowing human operators to focus on more complex urban or last-mile navigation. Currently, according to the American Journal of Transportation, the U.S. has a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers, a deficit expected to double by 2030. This is compounded by the composition of the trucking labor force - the average age of truck drivers exceeds the median labor force age in the U.S. Companies focusing on autonomous driving are therefore going to be crucial if nearshoring momentum is going to keep picking up. Companies like Aurora Innovation (AUR) have teamed up with technology giants like Nvidia (NVDA) to mass produce its integrated driverless systems. Furthermore, companies like Tesla have been working on Semitruck technologies for years. LIVINGSTON, MONTANA – APRIL 5: Boeing 737Next generation fuselages manufactured by Spirt AeroSystems ... [+] in Wichita, Kansas on a BSNF train heading to the Boeing assembly plant in Renton, Washington. The train is making it's way over the Bozeman pass near Livingston, Montana. On March 18th, 2017 Boeing signed a US$3 billion dollar deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines for 30 737's with an option for 30 more. (Photo by William Campbell/Corbis via Getty Images) There is no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling the logistics of nearshoring, and trucking is not the only solution. Intermodal transportation, the integration of tracking and rail, is set to grow substantially as trucking routes shrink and the just-in-time approach to inventory management continues to permeate American manufacturing. Intermodal transportation isn’t a novel idea, but the relationship between the two transportation methods will have to deepen to accommodate nearshoring and the current demographics of the trucking labor force. Intermodal transportation relies heavily on strategic partnerships between railroads and trucking companies to optimize the process of getting FTL shipments onto rail cars and shipped across North America. All of the big players in FTL trucking are attached to the hip with Class I railroads like BNSF Railway, Union Pacific (UP)and Norfolk Southern (NSC), so the ability to leverage scale and in-house logistics is of utmost importance. Rail hasn’t seen the same levels of growth as trucking over the last 20 years but is still well-suited for transporting large volumes of goods over long distances, making it a cost-effective option for long transports. Although the actual volume of rail freight is less than that of trucking, rail networks are essential to shortening trucking routes and reducing congestion on highways. Investments in rail infrastructure, including expanded rail yards, upgraded tracks, and digitization of intermodal facilities are all going to be essential in the years to come. However, investing in infrastructure is expensive and scale brings advantages in safety standards and cost efficiency. We wouldn’t be surprised to see M&A activity in the space pick up as nearshoring continues. Even if there’s no M&A, we still expect the space to have significant funding needs. Any build-out of intermodal transportation networks is going to be capital intensive. Electrification, new tracks, and new freight cars all have significant up front costs with long pay back periods. Specialized lenders and private credit shops will have opportunities to engage in asset-backed lending against those hard assets in the years ahead. Nearshoring is poised to uplift the significance of both rail and trucking industries. As manufacturing moves closer to home, the demand for efficient, localized logistics will only grow, requiring substantial innovation and capital. The integration of rail and trucking through intermodal transportation will be critical to maintaining the speed and flexibility needed for just-in-time delivery systems. Meanwhile, the trucking sector will see increased demand for less-than-truckload and third-party logistics as businesses continue to seek more agile, responsive supply chains. Technological advancements will also play a pivotal role in reducing operational costs for shippers. For investors, this evolving landscape presents opportunities in the picks and shovels needed for transporting goods from point A to point B. As nearshoring continues to gain momentum, the future of U.S. freight transportation will be defined by innovation, collaboration, and a renewed focus on North American trade, and is worth keeping a close eye on.

Title: Local organizer wants to fix REI from the top—and REI is fighting to keep her off the ballot

REI is having an identity crisis. Originally formed as a co-op in 1938, it earned a strong reputation in our community for its commitment to environmental issues, fair treatment of workers, and climate education initiatives. These values fostered generations of loyal customers who felt good about supporting the company. But over the past few years, REI has appointed a decidedly corporate-leaning board of directors, with former executives from Exxon Mobil, Starbucks, and McKinsey. Employees identify this shift as the start of anti-worker treatment at the company, like unpredictable scheduling and waves of layoffs, which the company attributes to slow sales. And while it’s true that REI’s finances have fluctuated in recent years, reports of its financial death are greatly exaggerated. In 2020, in the first year of COVID-19, the company sold its newly completed Bellevue headquarters to Meta for $390 million. And then when people took to the outdoors for safe exercise, REI’s sales boomed: up 37% in 2021 to a total of $3.7 billion, reporting a $97.7 million profit. REI reported a slight uptick to $3.8 billion in revenue in 2022 and $3.76 billion in 2023, but somehow still managed to lose millions in both years. That mismanagement at the top has resulted in repeated waves of layoffs: 167 people were laid off in 2023, then 357 in 2024, and 428 more this month, shuttering its beloved outdoor education Experiences arm. In 2022, REI’s New York City SoHo location was the first of its 187 stores to unionize. Nine others, including their Bellingham store, have since followed suit. REI has refused to negotiate a contract with the REI Union for over two years now and retained Morgan Lewis, a notorious union-busting law firm that also represents Amazon and SpaceX, and previously counted Donald Trump as a client. This week, 63 lawmakers including Senator Bernie Sanders sent a letter to REI urging them to bargain fairly with their workers and stop their union-busting activity. CEO Eric Artz announced his retirement last week, with new CEO Mary Beth Laughton taking over on February 3. She inherits a company with shaky finances and a once-sterling public image that has suffered in recent years. REI claims they have a transparent and democratic process for their annual board elections, yet candidates must be approved by the current board to even appear on the ballot to be voted on by its members. Workers are currently ineligible to run for the board, as well. However, Shemona Moreno, a local climate activist, longtime REI member, and REI Union-endorsed candidate, is running to hopefully steer REI back to its roots. The current board will decide which candidates will be allowed on the ballot at their meeting on Monday, February 3. You’re running to help return REI to its roots. Can you introduce yourself to folks who don’t already know about what you do? Shemona Moreno: I'm the executive director at 350 Seattle. We're a local grassroots non-profit focused on climate justice and the intersections of climate and workers' rights, abolition, and a variety of issues because we believe we can't solve our climate crisis in a silo. I've been with 350 Seattle since right after Trump was elected the first time. I was a nanny at the time. That was an activating moment for me to move from supporting from the sidelines to becoming more of a participant in my community and learning how to be an activist. So I started off as a volunteer with 350 Seattle, and then I had the opportunity to join the staff in 2018. I became executive director two years ago, and am starting my third year as ED now. I wouldn't say I've always been a climate activist, but it's something I grew into. My mother was really into activism, specifically around racial justice issues and police accountability, so I grew up going to actions and action-planning meetings with my mom. And here I am now doing similar work, working with people who care about what our future is going to look like. The question is: how are we thriving in our future and not just surviving? What are some projects you’ve worked on with 350 Seattle that you’re proud of? Around 2018 when the Green New Deal came onto the scene, we made a bit of a pivot at 350 Seattle to be focused more on solutions that will replace a lot of this infrastructure that we're trying to dismantle. We still need water. We still need food. So how are we doing that sustainably? What are the solutions that work with the community instead of against it? We ran a campaign called Solar Schools, working with other unions like the Seattle Education Association and MLK Labor to take levy money and invest it in renewable energy. We felt strongly we should be putting solar panels on top of our schools, and provide heating, cooling, and air filtration to all of our schools to keep our kids safe. We won that, and those projects are now underway. Another campaign we ran and won was called Healthy Through Heat and Smoke, which was another levy fight. We pushed Seattle Parks to invest in proper heating and cooling because out of the 26 community centers in Seattle, only three or four of them have air conditioning. In the 2021 heat dome, people died because they didn't have anywhere to go. What’s the pitch for your candidacy? What separates you from REI’s current board members? I’m a voice for the people who do not have representation on that board. I'm a voice for the workers. I'm also a voice for the people who actually care about preserving the planet, the air, and the water, and the considerations that's going to take. As you look at these issues that are confronting REI, what’s your vision for what REI could be? What is REI now? What are they doing? And who are they aligning themselves to? We're seeing them get rid of a lot of the things that support the members and the workers. We just saw a bunch of layoffs. So what's next? What else is REI going to compromise on for the sake of making money for a few people? I think we could learn a lot from the workers who actually speak to the consumers at brick and mortar stores. The members have good ideas. There's value there. I think you could do an audit and ask, what do people want from REI? And not just people who have lots of money, but regular people who could say, ‘I would go there a lot more if it was accessible to me in this way.’ People are now thinking carefully about how they spend their money. Does REI want to be one of those companies that's put on a boycott list? Or do they want to be one of the companies that's celebrated? We could have a company here that's thinking about us, that cares about the issues that we care about. And right now, it seems like REI does not. Do you have any comment on the news that REI is canceling its Experiences arm? Is this the kind of thing you would support if you were on the board? When I first joined REI as a member, I did some of the Experiences before I bought anything. I was just getting into hiking and learned about different tools, how to keep myself safe, what are the things that I need to know when I start journeying out into the wild to make sure I’m doing it respectfully. I think those Experiences set REI apart from its competitors for me. So this news is a bummer. I'm curious what led to that decision. It seems like the capitalist mindset of ‘it wasn't making money, therefore, it wasn't useful.’ But do we always have to be thinking about whether or not something is making money? Is that a good metric of real value? With over 3,000 members supporting your candidacy and lawmakers urging REI to listen to their workers, do you see this as a mandate for your board seat? It is a clear mandate. I believe 100 percent that things need to change. At the very least, we should change the way the co-op board operates. There should be representation from workers. It's not hard! We saw PCC do it and PCC is still around. It didn't implode by adding two workers' voices onto that board. Another place we can start is bargaining with the union in good faith. Listening to your workers around safety issues and things that need to be fixed, that is also not an impossible task. You'll probably spend less money on it than you would paying the union-busting firm that's represented the likes of Amazon and Trump. Like, come on. Do you really want to align yourself with them? What does success look like for this company if they're going to continue to alienate their base? REI is now claiming they never received your application for the board election. But you’ve shown me screenshots of your submission, sent ahead of the deadline. What gives? I emailed my application before the deadline. The best case scenario is someone didn't check their spam folder. The worst case scenario is REI is afraid of a pro-staff candidate for Board. This is not the REI I know and love. I applied to run for the board to be a voice for the people in green vests who make REI great but who are not allowed a voice on the co-op’s board of directors. More than 3,000 REI members and customers signed a petition in support of my candidacy for the board to bring REI back to its roots, and ensure the company walks their talk on sustainability and worker rights. REI must listen to its member-owners. So where does this go from here? If REI rejects your candidacy, are you planning to run again? There’s a bill in the Washington State Legislature that would require Washington businesses designated as a co-op to include employees on the board and follow a transparent democratic process for elections. I personally rally readers to support that bill. Contact your legislators and make sure they're hearing all of our voices across Washington State in support of that bill. That’s a good next step if I don't make it onto the board. And I'm open to running again if that is something workers in the union would like of me. But this isn’t all about me. It's about the workers at REI and the union. I'm just an ally, and this is how I can be in support of the union and the workers, by following their lead. I would surely do it again. We have to stand up and hold them accountable because at the end of the day, they're making all this money, but we're the people who actually buy things. We're the people that work. They can't do this without us. They need us. Conor Kelley covers labor for The Stranger. He is currently being priced out of Capitol Hill.

Title: Beyond benchmarks: How DeepSeek-R1 and o1 perform on real-world tasks

Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More DeepSeek-R1 has surely created a lot of excitement and concern, especially for OpenAI’s rival model o1. So, we put them to test in a side-by-side comparison on a few simple data analysis and market research tasks. To put the models on equal footing, we used Perplexity Pro Search, which now supports both o1 and R1. Our goal was to look beyond benchmarks and see if the models can actually perform ad hoc tasks that require gathering information from the web, picking out the right pieces of data and performing simple tasks that would require substantial manual effort. Both models are impressive but make errors when the prompts lack specificity. o1 is slightly better at reasoning tasks but R1’s transparency gives it an edge in cases (and there will be quite a few) where it makes mistakes. Here is a breakdown of a few of our experiments and the links to the Perplexity pages where you can review the results yourself. Our first test gauged whether models could calculate returns on investment (ROI). We considered a scenario where the user has invested $140 in the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla) on the first day of every month from January to December 2024. We asked the model to calculate the value of the portfolio at the current date. To accomplish this task, the model would have to pull Mag 7 price information for the first day of each month, split the monthly investment evenly across the stocks ($20 per stock), sum them up and calculate the portfolio value according to the value of the stocks on the current date. In this task, both models failed. o1 returned a list of stock prices for January 2024 and January 2025 along with a formula to calculate the portfolio value. However, it failed to calculate the correct values and basically said that there would be no ROI. On the other hand, R1 made the mistake of only investing in January 2024 and calculating the returns for January 2025. However, what was interesting was the models’ reasoning process. While o1 did not provide much details on how it had reached its results, R1’s reasoning traced showed that it did not have the correct information because Perplexity’s retrieval engine had failed to obtain the monthly data for stock prices (many retrieval-augmented generation applications fail not because of the model lack of abilities but because of bad retrieval). This proved to be an important bit of feedback that led us to the next experiment. We decided to run the same experiment as before, but instead of prompting the model to retrieve the information from the web, we decided to provide it in a text file. For this, we copy-pasted stock monthly data for each stock from Yahoo! Finance into a text file and gave it to the model. The file contained the name of each stock plus the HTML table that contained the price for the first day of each month from January to December 2024 and the last recorded price. The data was not cleaned to reduce the manual effort and test whether the model could pick the right parts from the data. Again, both models failed to provide the right answer. o1 seemed to have extracted the data from the file, but suggested the calculation be done manually in a tool like Excel. The reasoning trace was very vague and did not contain any useful information to troubleshoot the model. R1 also failed and didn’t provide an answer, but the reasoning trace contained a lot of useful information. For example, it was clear that the model had correctly parsed the HTML data for each stock and was able to extract the correct information. It had also been able to do the month-by-month calculation of investments, sum them and calculate the final value according to the latest stock price in the table. However, that final value remained in its reasoning chain and failed to make it into the final answer. The model had also been confounded by a row in the Nvidia chart that had marked the company’s 10:1 stock split on June 10, 2024, and ended up miscalculating the final value of the portfolio. Again, the real differentiator was not the result itself, but the ability to investigate how the model arrived at its response. In this case, R1 provided us with a better experience, allowing us to understand the model’s limitations and how we can reformulate our prompt and format our data to get better results in the future. Another experiment we carried out required the model to compare the stats of four leading NBA centers and determine which one had the best improvement in field goal percentage (FG%) from the 2022/2023 to the 2023/2024 seasons. This task required the model to do multi-step reasoning over different data points. The catch in the prompt was that it included Victor Wembanyama, who just entered the league as a rookie in 2023. The retrieval for this prompt was much easier, since player stats are widely reported on the web and are usually included in their Wikipedia and NBA profiles. Both models answered correctly (it’s Giannis in case you were curious), although depending on the sources they used, their figures were a bit different. However, they did not realize that Wemby did not qualify for the comparison and gathered other stats from his time in the European league. In its answer, R1 provided a better breakdown of the results with a comparison table along with links to the sources it used for its answer. The added context enabled us to correct the prompt. After we modified the prompt specifying that we were looking for FG% from NBA seasons, the model correctly ruled out Wemby from the results. Reasoning models are powerful tools, but still have a ways to go before they can be fully trusted with tasks, especially as other components of large language model (LLM) applications continue to evolve. From our experiments, both o1 and R1 can still make basic mistakes. Despite showing impressive results, they still need a bit of handholding to give accurate results. Ideally, a reasoning model should be able to explain to the user when it lacks information for the task. Alternatively, the reasoning trace of the model should be able to guide users to better understand mistakes and correct their prompts to increase the accuracy and stability of the model’s responses. In this regard, R1 had the upper hand. Hopefully, future reasoning models, including OpenAI’s upcoming o3 series, will provide users with more visibility and control.

Title: Starbucks and Workers United turn to mediator as contract talks stall

Starbucks (SBUX+2.31%) and the labor union representing roughly 10,000 employees have agreed to bring in a mediator to help move forward with ongoing contract negotiations. The decision follows months of bargaining that had previously paused in December, after union workers argued the company had yet to present a comprehensive offer. In a joint statement, both Starbucks and the union expressed their commitment to working with a mediator to address the “complex issues” at hand and reach fair agreements for both sides. “Bringing in a professional mediator is a positive step toward securing fair union contracts,” said Michelle Eisen, a 14-year barista and bargaining delegate. “We’re optimistic that Starbucks will finally move off their fixed position on wages and benefits as we continue these negotiations.” Union workers have been vocal throughout the process, which began in April 2024, including during a high-profile strike last holiday season. On Christmas Eve, baristas walked off the job to demand better wages, benefits, and working conditions. The strike helped build momentum for the union’s efforts, as Starbucks employees continue to push for a fair deal. In addition to ongoing contract talks, Starbucks is making changes to streamline operations. The company plans to lay off some employees in the next two months, though it remains unclear whether these layoffs will affect only corporate roles or include frontline workers. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol also announced recently that the company’s “open-door” policy, which previously allowed anyone to enter stores, would now limit service to paying customers only. This policy shift includes ramping up security at select locations and even closing stores where security measures are not proving effective. As part of his “Back to Starbucks” strategy, Niccol has made other moves to reshape the company. Recently, Starbucks hired two former Taco Bell executives to help lead changes in store operations and customer service. The company is also cutting its menu by 30% and removing the up charge for non-dairy milks, which have grown in popularity among customers. With a mediator now in the mix, both sides aim to resolve their differences while finding common ground. Similarly to Starbucks, workers at Costco (COST+1.60%) and Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) have pushed for better pay and benefits, with the latter striking. At Costco, a strike is looming, despite the retailer’s wage boost offer. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

What do Nvidia (NVDA), The New Yorker, Chess.com and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have in common? They are all clients ElevenLabs, a startup that generates realistic audio with the help of A.I. Co-founded in 2022 by former Google (GOOGL) engineer Piotr Dabhowski and former Palantir strategist Mateusz Staniszewski, the London-based company has made waves in Silicon Valley for its voice cloning capabilities. Over the past year, the startup has more than tripled its valuation to a whopping $3.3 billion after a closing a $180 million round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Iconiq Growth, the company announced yesterday (Jan. 30).

The capital will be used to expand ElevenLabs’ capabilities and make its A.I. voices more “expressive and controllable,” the company said. “Speech is how we naturally communicate. This funding moves us closer to a world where digital interactions happen by voice—fluid, natural and as effortless as a conversation,” said Staniszewski, who serves as CEO of ElevenLabs, in a statement. ElevenLabs’ products include tools that build interactive voice agents, generate custom voices or sound effects via text prompts and help voice actors monetize A.I.-generated audio. According to the company, its technology has been embraced by workers at more than 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Customers range from peer A.I. companies like Perplexity AI, which uses ElevenLabs to generate podcasts summarizing the news, to publishers like The Washington Post and The Atlantic, which utilize the technology to create audio versions of stories. Last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams tapped the startup to contact New Yorkers with multilingual robocalls. The rise of A.I.-generated voices hasn’t been without controversy. Last year, audio experts claimed that technology from ElevenLabs was used to generate robocalls mimicking the voice of former President Joe Biden to voters in New Hampshire during the Presidential campaign. ElevenLabs subsequently suspended the account behind the fake robocalls. The company said its latest funding will be used to bolster A.I. safety and ensure its products are deployed without harm. To date, ElevenLabs has raised $281 million in venture funding. Its top backers include Sequoia Capital, Smash Capital, Broadlight Capital, SV Angel, NFDG and Salesforce’s venture arm. The A.I. voice industry generated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2023. That figure is expected to exceed $21 billion by the end of the decade, according to data from Grand View Research.

As of Dec. 2024, corporate disclosures based on public statements and filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that had a material impact on stock price of companies listed in the NYSE or NASDAQ, increased in both frequency and severity by 6.0% and 7.0%, respectively, relative to the two-year period ending in Sept. 2024. According to the report, SAR identified 10,536 high-risk adverse corporate events, from a population of 4,605 U.S. public companies, as of the two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2024, by uniformly applying a single-firm event study analyses to test stock price reaction on corporate disclosures disseminated via public statements and filings with the SEC. The market capitalization losses related to high-risk adverse corporate events, amount to approximately $10 trillion, an increase of $1.1 trillion relative to the two-year period ending Sept. 2024. The Information Technology sector topped the charts with $2.8 trillion, followed by Consumer Discretionary and Health Care, with $1.6 and $1.4 trillion, respectively. "The frequency and severity of adverse corporate events are the dominant drivers that foment securities litigation risks for directors and officers of U.S. public companies. As of the fourth quarter, issuers now face an increase of about $1 trillion in market capitalization losses linked to high-risk adverse corporate events that materially impacted stock price during the preceding two years. The securities plaintiffs' bar will take advantage of increasing complexity around risk factor disclosures after the Supreme Court punted on the high-severity securities class action against Meta last quarter. As a result, the securities litigation risks for issuers will be greater in 2025," said Nessim Mezrahi, Co-Founder and CEO of SAR. Key Takeaways: The securities litigation risk footprint of the Information Technology sector exhibited the greatest change during the last quarter of 2024, followed by Communication Services and Financials. SAR quantifies the securities litigation risk footprint based on the economic impact of adverse corporate events, together with the change in market capitalization of constituent companies within each of the eleven industry sectors, based on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). As of Dec. 2024, the sector with the highest market capitalization losses as percentage of the sector-specific market capitalization is Consumer Discretionary at 19.18%, followed by Health Care and Industrials, with 19.15% and 17.63%, respectively. Information Technology companies faced the greatest market capitalization losses per high-risk adverse corporate event, amounting to $1.73 billion, followed by Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary with $1.59 and $1.2 billion, respectively. The sector with the highest median SAR Risk Score is Health Care with a median score of 29.11%, followed by Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary with 25.44% and 24.21%, respectively. This independent, semi-annual U.S. equity research report presents an appendix with the median SAR Risk Scores across all GICS groups, industries, and sub-industries. The SAR Platform provides users with the near real-time securities litigation risk footprint, with full transparency at the corporate disclosure level, for public companies that trade in the NYSE and NASDAQ.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) just landed a game-changing win, which drives its share by 14% this early afternoon. The FCC has granted Special Temporary Authority (STA), clearing the way for ASTS to test its first five commercial BlueBird satellites across the U.S. The kicker? These satellites connect directly to unmodified smartphones on AT&T and Verizon networksno special software, no hardware tweaks. The initial Block 1 satellites will provide non-continuous coverage with 5,600 cells, but the upcoming Block 2 BlueBirds, packing 2,400 square-foot communication arrays, promise speeds up to 120 Mbps. Thats a serious leap forward in space-based cellular broadband. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with ASTS. And the market is paying attention. AST SpaceMobile has secured major backing from AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) this year, plus fresh U.S. government contracts. On top of that, theyve locked in deals with 45+ mobile network operators, giving them access to a staggering 2.8 billion subscribers worldwide. The ability to deliver full cellular broadband straight from spacewithout requiring users to change a thingsets ASTS apart in a market still dominated by text-only satellite services. Its a big step toward closing connectivity gaps and creating a new frontier for mobile networks. The FCC green light isnt just a regulatory winits validation that AST SpaceMobiles tech is the real deal. With five U.S. gateways already in the works, the company is fast-tracking its commercial rollout. As ASTS scales from testing to full deployment, its seamless integration with existing networks could be a game-changer for emergency communications, rural coverage, and even emerging markets. Investors are watching closely, and with ASTS pushing the limits of what satellite broadband can do, this could be the start of something huge. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: DeepSeek: what you need to know about the Chinese firm disrupting the AI landscape
URL: https://theconversation.com/deepseek-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-firm-disrupting-the-ai-landscape-248621
Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:34:05Z
Full Content:
Assistant Professor of Economics, University of Leeds University Fellow in AI and Human Decision Making, University of Salford Richard Whittle receives funding from the ESRC, Research England and was the recipient of a CAPE Fellowship. Stuart Mills does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. University of Salford and University of Leeds provide funding as founding partners of The Conversation UK. View all partners Before January 27 2025, it’s fair to say that Chinese tech company DeepSeek was flying under the radar. And then it came dramatically into view. Suddenly, everyone was talking about it – not least the shareholders and executives at US tech firms like Nvidia, Microsoft and Google, which all saw their company values tumble thanks to the success of this AI startup research lab. Founded by a successful Chinese hedge fund manager, the lab has taken a different approach to artificial intelligence. One of the major differences is cost. The development costs for Open AI’s ChatGPT-4 were said to be in excess of US$100 million (£81 million). DeepSeek’s R1 model – which is used to generate content, solve logic problems and create computer code – was reportedly made using much fewer, less powerful computer chips than the likes of GPT-4, resulting in costs claimed (but unverified) to be as low as US$6 million. This has both financial and geopolitical effects. China is subject to US sanctions on importing the most advanced computer chips. But the fact that a Chinese startup has been able to build such an advanced model raises questions about the effectiveness of these sanctions, and whether Chinese innovators can work around them. The timing of DeepSeek’s new release on January 20, as Donald Trump was being sworn in as president, signalled a challenge to US dominance in AI. Trump responded by describing the moment as a “wake-up call”. From a financial point of view, the most noticeable effect may be on consumers. Unlike rivals such as OpenAI, which recently began charging US$200 per month for access to their premium models, DeepSeek’s comparable tools are currently free. They are also “open source”, allowing anyone to poke around in the code and reconfigure things as they wish. Low costs of development and efficient use of hardware seem to have afforded DeepSeek this cost advantage, and have already forced some Chinese rivals to lower their prices. Consumers should anticipate lower costs from other AI services too. Longer term – which, in the AI industry, can still be remarkably soon – the success of DeepSeek could have a big impact on AI investment. This is because so far, almost all of the big AI companies – OpenAI, Meta, Google – have been struggling to commercialise their models and be profitable. Until now, this was not necessarily a problem. Companies like Twitter and Uber went years without making profits, prioritising a commanding market share (lots of users) instead. And companies like OpenAI have been doing the same. In exchange for continuous investment from hedge funds and other organisations, they promise to build even more powerful models. These models, the business pitch probably goes, will massively boost productivity and then profitability for businesses, which will end up happy to pay for AI products. In the mean time, all the tech companies need to do is collect more data, buy more powerful chips (and more of them), and develop their models for longer. But this costs a lot of money. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip – the world’s most powerful AI chip to date – costs around US$40,000 per unit, and AI companies often need tens of thousands of them. But up to now, AI companies haven’t really struggled to attract the necessary investment, even if the sums are huge. DeepSeek might change all this. By demonstrating that innovations with existing (and perhaps less advanced) hardware can achieve similar performance, it has given a warning that throwing money at AI is not guaranteed to pay off. For example, prior to January 20, it may have been assumed that the most advanced AI models require massive data centres and other infrastructure. This meant the likes of Google, Microsoft and OpenAI would face limited competition because of the high barriers (the vast expense) to enter this industry. But if those barriers to entry are much lower than everyone thinks – as DeepSeek’s success suggests – then many massive AI investments suddenly look a lot riskier. Hence the abrupt effect on big tech share prices. Shares in chipmaker Nvidia fell by around 17% and ASML, which creates the machines needed to manufacture advanced chips, also saw its share price fall. (While there has been a slight bounceback in Nvidia’s stock price, it appears to have settled below its previous highs, reflecting a new market reality.) Nvidia and ASML are “pick-and-shovel” companies that make the tools necessary to create a product, rather than the product itself. (The term comes from the idea that in a goldrush, the only person guaranteed to make money is the one selling the picks and shovels.) The “shovels” they sell are chips and chip-making equipment. The fall in their share prices came from the sense that if DeepSeek’s much cheaper approach works, the billions of dollars of future sales that investors have priced into these companies may not materialise. For the likes of Microsoft, Google and Meta (OpenAI is not publicly traded), the cost of building advanced AI may now have fallen, meaning these firms will have to spend less to remain competitive. That, for them, could be a good thing. But there is now doubt as to whether these companies can successfully monetise their AI programmes. US stocks make up a historically large percentage of global investment right now, and technology companies make up a historically large percentage of the value of the US stock market. Losses in this industry might force investors to sell off other investments to cover their losses in tech, leading to a whole-market downturn. And it shouldn’t have come as a surprise. In 2023, a leaked Google memo warned that the AI industry was exposed to outsider disruption. The memo argued that AI companies “had no moat” – no protection – against rival models. DeepSeek’s success may be the proof that this is true. Write an article and join a growing community of more than 197,400 academics and researchers from 5,125 institutions.

Title: DeepSeek: what you need to know about the Chinese firm disrupting the AI landscape

University of Salford and University of Leeds provide funding as founding partners of The Conversation UK. View all partners Before January 27 2025, it’s fair to say that Chinese tech company DeepSeek was flying under the radar. And then it came dramatically into view. Suddenly, everyone was talking about it – not least the shareholders and executives at US tech firms like Nvidia, Microsoft and Google, which all saw their company values tumble thanks to the success of this AI startup research lab. Founded by a successful Chinese hedge fund manager, the lab has taken a different approach to artificial intelligence. One of the major differences is cost. The development costs for Open AI’s ChatGPT-4 were said to be in excess of US$100 million (£81 million). DeepSeek’s R1 model – which is used to generate content, solve logic problems and create computer code – was reportedly made using much fewer, less powerful computer chips than the likes of GPT-4, resulting in costs claimed (but unverified) to be as low as US$6 million. This has both financial and geopolitical effects. China is subject to US sanctions on importing the most advanced computer chips. But the fact that a Chinese startup has been able to build such an advanced model raises questions about the effectiveness of these sanctions, and whether Chinese innovators can work around them. The timing of DeepSeek’s new release on January 20, as Donald Trump was being sworn in as president, signalled a challenge to US dominance in AI. Trump responded by describing the moment as a “wake-up call”. From a financial point of view, the most noticeable effect may be on consumers. Unlike rivals such as OpenAI, which recently began charging US$200 per month for access to their premium models, DeepSeek’s comparable tools are currently free. They are also “open source”, allowing anyone to poke around in the code and reconfigure things as they wish. Low costs of development and efficient use of hardware seem to have afforded DeepSeek this cost advantage, and have already forced some Chinese rivals to lower their prices. Consumers should anticipate lower costs from other AI services too. Longer term – which, in the AI industry, can still be remarkably soon – the success of DeepSeek could have a big impact on AI investment. This is because so far, almost all of the big AI companies – OpenAI, Meta, Google – have been struggling to commercialise their models and be profitable. Until now, this was not necessarily a problem. Companies like Twitter and Uber went years without making profits, prioritising a commanding market share (lots of users) instead. And companies like OpenAI have been doing the same. In exchange for continuous investment from hedge funds and other organisations, they promise to build even more powerful models. These models, the business pitch probably goes, will massively boost productivity and then profitability for businesses, which will end up happy to pay for AI products. In the mean time, all the tech companies need to do is collect more data, buy more powerful chips (and more of them), and develop their models for longer. But this costs a lot of money. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip – the world’s most powerful AI chip to date – costs around US$40,000 per unit, and AI companies often need tens of thousands of them.

Title: DeepSeek is driving demand for Nvidia's H200 chips, some cloud firms say
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/deepseek-fuels-nvidia-h200-demand-cloud-cheaper-workload-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:01:00Z
Full Content:
Some cloud providers are experiencing a notable uptick in demand for Nvidia's H200 chips after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek this month burst into the race for the winning foundation model. Though the stock market caught wind of the powerful yet efficient large language model on Monday, sending Nvidia's stock down, DeepSeek has been on the radar of AI researchers and developers since it released its first model, V2, in May. But the performance of V3, released in December, is what made AI developers sit up and take notice. When R1, the company's reasoning model, which competes with OpenAI's o1, was released in January, demand for Nvidia's H200s started climbing. "The launch of DeepSeek R1 has significantly accelerated demand for H200," said Robert Brooks, a founding team member and vice president of revenue at the cloud provider Lambda. "We've seen such strong interest that enterprises are prepurchasing large blocks of Lambda's H200 capacity even before public availability." DeepSeek's models are open source, which means users pay very little to use them. But they still need hardware or a cloud computing service to use them at scale. Business Insider talked to 10 cloud service and AI inference providers. Five reported a rapid increase in demand for Nvidia's H200 graphics processing units this month. Amazon Web Services and CoreWeave declined to comment. Oracle, Google, and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. This week, AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia have made DeepSeek models available on their various cloud and AI developer platforms or provided instructions for users to do so themselves. Nvidia declined to comment, citing a quiet period before its earnings release on February 26. AI cloud offerings have exploded in the past two years, creating a slew of options beyond the mainstays of cloud computing such as Microsoft Azure and AWS. The demand has come from a range of customers, including startups, individual researchers, and massive multinational firms. "We've heard from half a dozen of the 50 largest companies in the world," Tuhin Srivastava, a cofounder of the inference provider Baseten, told BI. "I'm really not exaggerating." On Friday, semiconductor industry analysts at SemiAnalysis reported "tangible effects" on pricing for H100 and H200 capacity in the market stemming from DeepSeek. Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, said on the company's November earnings call that total sales of Nvidia H200 GPUs had reached the "double-digit billions." Karl Mozurkewich and his team at the cloud provider Valdi saw H200 demand ramp up throughout January — and at first, they didn't know why. The Valdi team doesn't own chips; it acquires capacity from existing data centers and sells that capacity to customers. The company doesn't know every use case for each chip it makes accessible, but it polled several H200 customers, and all wanted the chips to run DeepSeek. "Suddenly R1 got everybody's attention — it caught fire — and then it kind of went exponential," Mozurkewich said. American companies are eager to take advantage of DeepSeek's model performance and reasoning innovations, but most are not keen to share their data with a Chinese firm. That means they can either use an API offered by a US firm or run the model on their own hardware. Since the model is open source, it can be downloaded and run locally without sharing data with DeepSeek. Mozurkewich said most of Valdi's H200 demand was coming from startups. "It appears the market is reacting to DeepSeek by grabbing the best GPUs available for testing as quickly as possible," he said, adding, "This makes sense, as most companies' current GPUs are likely to continue to work on ongoing tasks they've been allocated to." Though many companies are still testing and experimenting, the Valdi team is seeing longer-term requests for additional hardware, suggesting an uptick in demand that could last beyond DeepSeek's initial hype cycle. DeepSeek's research paper indicates its models were trained with less powerful hardware than US models. This efficiency has spooked the stock market. Companies like Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft have invested billions in AI infrastructure, with billions more on the way. Investors are concerned about whether all that capacity will be needed. DeepSeek was created with fewer, relatively weak chips (though the number is hotly debated). Training chips aside, using the models for inference is a compute-intensive task, cloud providers say. "It is not light and easy to run," Srivastava said. The size of a model is measured in parameters. More parameters require more compute. The most powerful versions of DeepSeek's models have 678 billion parameters. OpenAI's GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion, while Meta's largest Llama model has 405 billion. Srivastava said most firms were avoiding the 405 billion-parameter Llama model if they could help it, since the smaller version was much easier to run. DeepSeek offers smaller versions too, and even its most powerful version is cheaper to run, which has stoked excitement with firms that want to use the full model, the cloud providers said. H200 chips are the only widely available Nvidia chip that can run DeepSeek's V3 model in its full form on a single node (eight chips designed to work together). You can also spread it across more lower-power GPUs, but that requires more expertise and leaves room for error. Adding that complexity almost inevitably slows down performance, Srivastava said. Nvidia's Blackwell chips will also be able to handle the full V3 model in one node, but these chips have just begun shipping this year. With demand spiking, finding enough chips to run V3 or R1 at high speed is tough if they haven't already been allocated. Baseten doesn't own GPUs; it buys capacity from data centers that do and then tinkers with all the software connections to make models run smoothly. Some of its customers have their own hardware in their own data centers but hire Baseten to optimize model performance. Its customers especially value inference speed — the speed that enables an AI-generated voice to converse in real time, for example. Srivastava said DeepSeek's capacity at the open-source price was a game changer for its customers. "It does feel like this is an inflection point," he said. Have a tip or an insight to share?

Title: The Top Specialty PR Firms in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:00:51Z
Full Content:
In an era where perception is currency, specialty PR firms are the brokers of influence Why does specialty PR matter? Because in an economy driven by perception, those who control the narrative control the market. And in a country where culture and commerce are inextricably linked, they don’t just shape industries—they shape the world we live in. Specialty PR firms shape what people see, hear and believe. On a micro level, they dictate which restaurants are impossible to book, which hotels are suddenly the destination and which films, albums and IPOs dominate cultural and financial conversations. On a macro level, they steer industries, influence policy narratives and define what matters in public discourse. In an era where perception is indistinguishable from reality, these PR firms don’t manage visibility but manufacture it. Specialty firms operate with precision. They don’t waste time trying to make a finance executive “relatable” or an indie musician “mainstream.” They know exactly where influence lives and how to embed clients within the conversations that matter. A hospitality PR firm doesn’t just push a hotel—it builds mythology around it. A tech PR firm doesn’t just announce funding rounds—it positions a company as an innovator before the market even realizes it’s relevant. And this matters to everyone. The stories people engage with, the trends they adopt, the brands they trust—these aren’t accidents. Specialty PR firms ensure that what rises above the noise isn’t what’s loudest but what’s designed to dominate. In a world oversaturated with content, they filter. For better or worse, they decide what gets remembered. Looking into 2025, these are the best specialty PR firms in the categories that matter most to Observer. Nightlife and dining PR engineers desire. It’s the whisper campaign that turns a tucked-away speakeasy into a celebrity haunt, the strategic leaks that make a restaurant impossible to book before it even opens and the viral moment so perfectly executed that the cocktails are practically copyrighted. It’s knowing which influencers to plant near the DJ, which critics to invite (or mysteriously forget), how to position a new tasting menu as the next gastronomic revolution and how to spin a kitchen meltdown into “an off-night” rather than a full-blown disaster. Whether launching a buzzy rooftop lounge, securing a Michelin nod or keeping a legacy institution relevant in a fickle industry, PR defines the scene itself. In nightlife and dining, perception is currency. “Creativity drives success." — Co-Founder Eva Karagiorgas It’s been a delicious year for Ilana Alperstein and Eva Karagiorgas’ ten-year-old PR firm. In 2024, Mona Creative added nearly 100 new clients and saw 35 percent year-on-year growth, an impressive feat in an industry where trends move at the speed of a viral TikTok. Named agency of record for the iconic estiatorio Milos brand worldwide, the firm also won celebrated clients like H&H Bagels, Dominique Ansel Bakery and Acru from NA:EUN Hospitality―the team behind Atomix, hailed widely as one of the world’s best restaurants. Mona was at the center of the year’s most high-profile restaurant stories, overseeing the openings of Catch Hospitality's The Corner Store and Tao Group's Crane Club. Mona handled PR for two additions to Miami’s Design District: Nami Nori’s December expansion and the forthcoming opening of Matsuyoi. The agency remains deeply embedded in David Chang’s Momofuku empire, including his social media-famous Majordōmo in Los Angeles, which had a wildly successful NYC pop-up last year. They’re also behind the much-anticipated Kabawa and Bar Kabawa, opening in February in the former Ko Bar space, featuring a prix-fixe menu helmed by Paul Carmichael, Momofuku’s head of culinary development. Beyond restaurants, Mona’s influence extends across food media and publishing. They represent James Beard-winning cookbook author and TV personality Hawa Hassan, whose Vogue-covered wedding in April 2024 was as much a media event as a personal milestone. They also repped the March launch of two-time James Beard and Webby Award-winning Sporkful host Dan Pashman's first book, Anything’s Pastable. monacreative.co “Integrity is our north star. Telling things the way they are is always the best approach.” — Founder Hanna Lee Hanna Lee Communications dominated the hospitality PR game in 2024, with some of the year’s biggest dining and spirits stories tracing back to its team. Café Carmellini by Andrew Carmellini and Ghee Indian Kitchen by Niven Patel and Mohamed Alkassar both landed coveted James Beard Award semifinalist nods, a testament to HLC’s knack for positioning clients at the center of industry acclaim. The firm continued its streak of high-impact launches, including the new Locanda Verde at Hudson Yards, The Portrait Bar and a slate of top-tier venues spanning New York, Miami and beyond. Celebrating 21 years, Hanna Lee's global reach now extends from New York to Nairobi, championing brands that shape the future of hospitality, from luxury hotels to world-class bars, spirits brands and distilleries. The firm's PR playbook doesn’t just generate headlines—it crafts legacy. That strategy paid off with two PRNews Platinum Awards: Best Restaurant/F&B Campaign for Woody Creek Distillers’ William H. Macy Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey and Best Podcast for Hospitality Forward, now heading into its seventh season. Beyond press, HLC continues to invest in the industry’s future. HLC Meet the Media champions journalism’s evolving landscape, while New York Bartender Week—returning in November 2025—spotlights bartending as both an art form and economic force. hannaleecommunications.com “I encourage everyone on the team to know what the media writes, how they write and who they write for.” — Founder Steven Hall Attending an industry event with Steven Hall is like touring a city with its mayor. After nearly 30 years, Hall PR remains the gold standard for those seeking the spotlight in nightlife and dining, and the founder's stature as an industry guru continues to draw established and emerging clients. Operating as both a power broker and cultural translator, 2024 was a banner year for the firm, marked by a slew of high-profile openings, milestone anniversaries and the kind of deep-rooted industry relationships that make Hall PR an enduring force. Legacy clients Carmine’s and Virgil’s celebrated 35 and 30 years, respectively, while Simon Oren’s Chef Driven Group—Hall PR’s very first client—continued its expansion with Acadia and Sempre Oggi. Aquavit hit the decade mark of holding two Michelin stars, and Chef Vijay Kumar of Semma was named a James Beard semifinalist for Best Chef NYS. Hall PR opened Wayward Fare in Prospect Heights with Akhtar Nawab and debuted Mango Bay, an Afro-Caribbean hotspot helmed by rising star Chef London Chase. Hall opened Cesar, Chef Cesar Ramirez’s two-Michelin-star restaurant; YongChuan, the Sichuan/Ningbo Chinese spot; Lungi, a Sri Lankan/Southern Indian eatery; and Medium Rare, a steak-frites brand from D.C. Already this year, Hall opened Chez Fifi from Sushi Noz owners David and Josh Foulquier, which swiftly became one of Manhattan's most sought-after reservations. Another Hall PR client, The Bronze Owl, was instantly dubbed “Manhattan’s hottest new cocktail bar.” The firm also oversaw the debut of Nōksu, a fine-dining enclave hidden beneath the 32nd Street subway station, where grilled mackerel with brown butter and squab with gochujang agrodolce is redefining underground luxury. Expanding its global influence, Hall PR signed on with Japanese food brand Kayanoya while continuing to broker licensing deals for Tokyo’s Garde properties, bringing Japanese brands stateside and vice versa. And in Harlem, Melba Wilson’s unstoppable empire is now part of the Hall PR family. hallpr.com "A company’s growth is directly tied to making people feel valued and dedicating time to cultivating strong leaders. When you invest in capable, forward-thinking leaders, you ignite a culture of innovation, accountability and unstoppable passion." — Founder Rachel Harrison In 2024, Rachel Harrison's eponymous PR agency secured Michelin Keys for Eastwind Hotel & Bar, NoMad London, Wildflower Farms, Auberge Resorts Collection and Crossroads while positioning Chef Dominique Crenn as a media sensation with placements in Bon Appétit and Cherry Bombe. The firm’s strategic storytelling landed Thailand as the filming location for The White Lotus season three, generating over 3 billion media impressions. In nightlife, RHC launched venues like Ànimo! and Revelie and signed legendary NYC institution Raoul's ahead of its 50th anniversary. RHC further solidified its industry impact with the "Manhattan Manhattan" campaign for Great Jones Distilling Co. and its comms strategy to ensure Superbueno was ranked #27 on the World's 50 Best Bars list (and #2 on North America's 50 Best Bars). "We’ve been leveling up year after year," Harrison says to Observer of the culture she's built. "Our low turnover allows us to continuously nurture and train a team of smart, dynamic and wildly creative professionals. Watching this team evolve into some of the most talented, visionary creatives I’ve ever worked with is something I’m immensely proud of—and it’s exactly what fuels our success." At the tail end of 2024, RHC brought on notable bars, including award-winning Sip & Guzzle and Press Club in Washington D.C. Blending trend-savvy editorial perspectives with strategic media outreach, RHC continues to shape the conversation in dining and nightlife. wearerhc.com “There will always be an arsenal of PR tactics to deploy, but those aren’t the campaigns you phone home about.” — Founder Gia Vecchio Foxglove has always punched above its weight in nightlife and dining PR, but 2024 was the year it leveled up in every direction. Gia Vecchio’s seven-year-old firm—which maintains a long and ever-growing client list of restaurants, chefs, bakeries, books and indie hotels—doubled its team, adding NYC industry heavyweight Liza Prijatel Thors (formerly of The Door) as vice president. It also expanded operations to Texas, picking up an award-winning roster of restaurants across Dallas, Houston and Austin. The firm’s expertise now extends far beyond restaurants, securing OpenTable as a major client and becoming the agency of record for food and beverage at Wynn hotels. Meanwhile, Foxglove’s influence in the luxury hospitality space continues to grow, snagging Cape & Kantary Thailand—two luxury, five-star properties—and taking on two of celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel's restaurants within his Mid-Atlantic expansion. Foxglove also deepened its authority in beverage and craft cocktails, signing Lunazul Tequila under the Heaven Hill portfolio and top-tier bar groups from Dear Irving to Experimental Group. The stately flower may have elegant spikes, but in the PR game, Vecchio's Foxglove is proving itself just as sharp. Foxglove isn’t slowing down in 2025, stacking high-profile wins that further cement its dominance in hospitality. The firm is leading the charge for Wonder’s ambitious Mid-Atlantic expansion, working to position the on-demand dining disruptor as a category-defining brand. In the spirits world, Foxglove has signed on with Cooper Spirits, handling several of its most esteemed labels, including Slow & Low. Meanwhile, the firm is bringing the adrenaline-fueled luxury of F1 Arcade to Philadelphia, ensuring the immersive racing experience makes a splash in a city primed for high-energy entertainment. Proving its track record in the industry’s upper echelon, Foxglove played a pivotal role in eight campaigns for 2025 James Beard Award-nominated restaurants and chefs, turning culinary excellence into headline-making moments. foxglovecommunications.com Luxury Travel PR sells fantasies. It’s the campaign that transforms a secluded island retreat into the next jet-set destination, the carefully placed feature that makes a $50,000-a-night safari lodge feel essential before the season’s bookings vanish and the media strategy that positions a heritage château as the discreet escape for power players. It’s securing glossy spreads, curating who gets invited to that ultra-exclusive press trip and ensuring the right whispers about a resort’s guest list make the rounds. Every detail—from the first embargoed preview to the last perfectly staged Instagram post—turns geo-tags into status symbols. In luxury travel, PR isn’t really about visibility but making sure the right people see it and everyone else wants to. “Empathy isn’t just a value—it’s a strength. When people feel cared for, solutions often follow naturally.” — Account Manager Ashley Mir Imagine PR had a powerhouse 2024, expanding its global footprint with a roster that reads like a high-end travel wishlist. Gabriele and Andreas Sappok's firm added Walk Japan, the country’s premier walking tour operator, and eriro, an ultra-luxe Austrian Alps retreat reachable only by cable car. Austria’s Forsthofgut, famed for its sprawling mountain spa, and Portugal’s W Algarve, home to a mix of luxury suites and residences, further cemented Imagine’s reputation for representing exclusive hospitality. The firm’s expansion into Africa included Stanley Safaris, a boutique operator crafting bespoke journeys across the continent and South Africa’s highly anticipated Spier Hotel, set to open in 2025 with a village-style design in the Cape Winelands. Switzerland’s legendary Tschuggen Collection and Iceland’s Sky Lagoon, with its newly opened Turf House inspired by Viking architecture, rounded out Imagine’s deepening influence in experiential luxury. In Florence, Imagine took on the historic Hotel Brunelleschi, built within the city’s oldest standing tower, while also securing The Broadway Collection as a client. But the year’s biggest coup? MJ The Musical—its first standalone show, with a global PR strategy positioning it as an essential NYC travel experience. For a firm that has long blended travel with cultural cachet, 2024 was the year Imagine PR proved that high-end hospitality and world-class entertainment belong in the same conversation. imagine-team.com Gizem Ozcelik continues to parlay out-of-the-park creativity with an intensive media strategy to produce game-changing client results. That approach is what led hospitality disruptor Generator and Freehand Hotels to seek the agency for representation across their portfolio and their foray into third-party management with the opening of the iconic Paramount Hotel in Times Square, focusing on boosting the profiles of brand leadership. GO PR will also spearhead Generator's 30th-anniversary efforts in 2025. Ozcelik has been working with the brand since 2016, helping to single-handedly change the perception of the hotel market in the U.S. and set the stage for the Freehand acquisition. In 2024, GO PR also expanded its wellness business, winning Naturopathica spas, tasked to to double the brand’s footprint in 2025 with openings in Aspen and Phoenix, as well as the Ballers social-sports brand from former Fitler Club Founders. The agency continues to add to its tentpole of boutique hotel launches; for the debut of Philadelphia’s indie Hotel Anna & Bel, GO PR secured over six billion impressions spanning 200 hits, Ozcelik tells Observer. go-pr.com “Sometimes the most creative ideas may not deliver immediate results, but will support the long-term goals." — Founder Melanie Brandman Melanie Brandman's eponymous PR agency hit its highest revenue in history last year, a feat that’s particularly impressive considering the hospitality industry’s post-pandemic reckoning. Along with a long list of stalwart accounts like COMO Hotels and Resorts and Ritz-Carlton properties, The Brandman Agency had a string of powerhouse wins in 2024, including the Peninsula Hotels’ global portfolio and IHG’s Luxury and Lifestyle brands (Six Senses). Brandman also unveiled Carlton Cannes, a Regent Hotel, with a major activation at the Cannes Film Festival. The agency orchestrated La Mamounia’s 100th-anniversary celebration, transforming the Moroccan landmark into a media magnet, drawing coverage in Vogue, Condé Nast Traveler and The Financial Times with over 54 million impressions. More than 35 percent of Brandman's clients have been with the agency for six years or more, including La Mamounia (16 years), Rome Cavalieri and Raffles Singapore (8 years each) and Experience Scottsdale (12 years). The Peninsula New York’s refurbishment campaign—complete with an exclusive Vogue100 rooftop event—showcases how Brandman curates moments that redefine brands. brandmanagency.com "My senior team appreciated me walking away, knowing we would get better business instead. That's the advantage of owning my own agency and being smart about the long game in PR.” — Founder Laura Davidson In an industry where client loyalty is rare, Laura Davidson Public Relations (LDPR) has built nearly 25 years of staying power. The firm has held onto Abercrombie & Kent, Paws Up in Montana and VisitScotland for almost 20 years and the Aman for 10. In just last year, LDPR added Park Hyatt New York, Windstar Cruises and Orient Express Italy, Melbourne/Visit Victoria, Andaz Miami Beach, NYC’s Sonesta Hotels, Grand Hyatt Scottsdale, the Grand Hotel Fasano in Lake Garda Italy and Sundance, Utah. Speaking with Observer, Laura Davidson stresses the importance of not chasing every opportunity but cultivating the right ones. The firm's refusal to take on business that treats agencies as vendors rather than partners has only strengthened its culture. The result? A record $4.5 million in revenue for 2024, with projections to hit $5 million in 2025. Beyond traditional tactics, LDPR has mastered the art of viral activations, from VisitScotland’s Coo Cam, a live feed of Highland cows, to Paws Up Resort’s partnership with Fender, blending luxury travel with music. Campaigns like the “Election Recovery Package” for O2 Beach Club in Barbados drive bookings while keeping the narrative fresh. ldpr.com "As we evolve, we are increasingly drawn to brands that embody an entrepreneurial spirit—those that ignite and embrace creativity while having the ability to transform ideas into action. Focusing our work on clients that are agile and collaborative allows our agency to do what we do best and bring to life original, creative and thoughtful ideas that make an impact for our clients." — Founder Meg Connolly Meg Connolly Communications (MCC) has long set the bar in luxury travel PR, and 2024 only reinforced its dominance. This year’s new wins read like a curated itinerary of the world’s most coveted destinations: Meadowood Napa Valley, The Marbella Club and three Auberge Resorts Collection properties, including The Dunlin, Primland and the highly anticipated Collegio alla Querce in Florence. The firm’s deep relationships are as much a calling card as its press coups. Longtime clients like Maybourne, The St. Regis New York and Pulitzer Amsterdam showcase MCC’s ability to retain the industry’s top names, while its campaigns—like the Vogue feature on the ultra-luxe private island escape, Islas Secas and The Dunlin’s buzzy debut—prove its mastery of cultural cachet. MCC’s deep network ensures launches land in all the right places, from Wes Gordon and Indre Rockefeller’s social feeds to the pages of Condé Nast Traveler. MCC has also made bold moves, walking away from corporate hospitality in favor of more entrepreneurial, creatively driven brands. “We are intentional about who we work with, even at the risk of growth,” Connolly tells Observer. The result? A client roster defined by prestige, impact and longevity. mcc-pr.com Entertainment PR keeps the right names in the headlines and the wrong ones buried in legal memos. It’s crafting Oscar campaigns that turn solid performances into “career-defining,” feeding blind items to DeuxMoi to keep a star relevant and ensuring that a flopped album or box office disaster somehow gets framed as “ahead of its time.” It’s the whisper network that decides which actor gets the GQ cover and which gets quietly sunset, and the media rollout transforms a niche indie musician into a pop culture force. It's turning a debut album into a cultural moment and a limited theater run into a must-see event. From stadium tours to arthouse films and red carpet premieres to sold-out residencies, entertainment PR is about influence, positioning talent and productions at the center of the cultural zeitgeist. "If you can’t picture it, don’t pitch it. If you can’t visualize an artist on a cover or a show, don’t waste anyone's time." — Founder Steve Martin Nasty Little Man founder Steve Martin’s deft handling of Dave Grohl’s latest headline was hailed by The New York Times as "a lesson in crisis control"—though at this point, navigating the rock PR high-wire is just business as usual. The firm’s latest run of campaigns reads like a masterclass in cultural impact: Paul McCartney’s Eyes of the Storm photography exhibition made its U.S. debut to rapturous press; Vampire Weekend’s Only God Was Above Us dominated the indie conversation; and St. Vincent’s All Born Screaming landed her a WNBA national anthem performance—a first, even for Martin, who’s been at this game for a while. Of course, loyalty is the real currency in rock and roll, and Martin’s client roster proves it. Beastie Boys (31 years), Foo Fighters (29 years), Radiohead (24 years), Arcade Fire (17 years) and LCD Soundsystem (16 years) still trust Nasty to keep them at the forefront. Metallica, another longtime client, isn’t just selling out stadiums but shaping real-world change through All Within My Hands, the band’s philanthropic foundation. Now in its sixth year, the Metallica Scholars Initiative has grown from 10 schools to 60, spanning all 50 states and Guam, pumping $10 million into workforce education, disaster relief and food insecurity initiatives—because nothing screams rock and roll like actually making a difference. nastylittleman.com "Working in theater is a gift. Not only is creativity appreciated, it’s expected." — Co-Founder Molly Barnett Molly Barnett and Chelsea Nachman’s theater-PR firm scored Broadway’s biggest coup with Oh, Mary!, a huge and unlikely sensation that theater critic David Cote dubbed "a splendidly nasty farce you will not want to miss." Grapevine Public Relations also reps long-running hit & Juliet, the only new musical of the 2022-23 Broadway season that recouped; highly anticipated new Idina Menzel vehicle Redwood; Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, who made her Broadway debut as composer of The Notebook; Cyndi Lauper, for all her theater projects; and playwright Theresa Rebeck, Lauper’s collaborator on next year’s Working Girl. Theater photographer Jenny Anderson is among Grapevine's newest clients; her book, The In-Between, will be released in April. Barnett tells Observer that 2024 was the firm's best year ever, with 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Amanda Marie Miller, who joined Barnett and Nachman in 2023, turning it into a three-person firm, tells Observer she's thrilled to work alongside the best in the business. "Grapevine puts an immense amount of energy and care into each client," Miller says. "It is an honor to work with such outstanding partners." grapevineprny.com "We see pressure as an opportunity to do our best work." — Founder Sheila Feren Thurston This insider’s insider entertainment PR firm, founded by longtime publicist Sheila Feren Thurston, just marked its 30th anniversary. The agency reps marquee brands, including Amazon’s Prime Video, AMC Networks, Disney Entertainment Television, Audible, TBS, Hulu and STARZ. Feren and her team have had a hand in launching shows including Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead Universe, along with recent hits like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Palm Royale and Slow Horses. AMC Networks has been a client for two decades, too. For Project Healthy Minds, whose mission is to destigmatize the topic of mental health, FerenComm veered from its entertainment roots to handle the non-profit’s annual New York gala and World Mental Health Day Festival in October. ferencomm.com "Crisis is an opportunity to live your values and demonstrate what you truly stand for." — Co-CEOs Amanda Silverman, Christine Su, Meredith O'Sullivan & Sarah Rothman Veterans of Observer’s PR Power List, this celebrity and entertainment heavyweight gained more star power in 2024. In November, The Lede Company opened a Nashville office to house its new music division, whose clients include Sabrina Carpenter, Post Malone, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, Rosalia, Shakira and A$AP Rocky. Co-founders Sarah Rothman, Amanda Silverman, Meredith O'Sullivan and Christine Su are growing the company's London office with an eye on even bigger European business. The agency’s new events practice will expand on Lede's work for clients like Louis Vuitton, Thom Browne and Coach. Hennessy grew its mandate with The Lede Company for comms, talent partnerships, influencer marketing and social. Among 2024’s big hires: Lede’s Chief Impact Officer Jackie Murphy, formerly Edelman’s managing director of brand, purpose and impact. Oh, and its ongoing clients include Cynthia Erivo, Zoe Saldana, Demi Moore, Reese Witherspoon and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The company continues to represent corporate and brand clients such as Audi, YouTube, Paramount and The North Face. As a strategic partner to Comcast NBCUniversal, Lede worked closely with them on the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. ledecompany.com "Genuine enthusiasm and passion are a critical priority when advocating for our projects. We also care about balancing our relationships with respect, trust, compassion…and a sense of humor is essential." — Founder Matt Polk It’s been an award-winning year for Matt Polk’s mighty theater-PR agency; with 26 competitive Tony Awards in 2024, Polk & Co clients won 12, or nearly half the awards bestowed. The firm’s clients also earned a total of 62 Tony Award nominations, including some categories with multiple nominees. Along the way, Polk and Co signed marquee clients, including Stranger Things: The First Shadow, co-produced by Netflix and Sonia Friedman; Alicia Keys’ Broadway musical Hell’s Kitchen; the stage adaptation of Prince’s Purple Rain; and Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures’ Crazy Rich Asians, directed by Hollywood’s Jon M. Chu. And its campaigns for blockbuster shows, including Gypsy (“A once-in-a-lifetime event! Top-to-bottom perfect”), Maybe Happy Ending ("the best, most beautiful, innovational and original musical"), Death Becomes Her (“Savagely funny. Wildly entertaining. A virtually perfect musical comedy") and the Merrily We Roll Along revival, have helped win both headlines and critical ovations. polkandco.com “Analytics matter less to us than bringing culture-shifting art to a bigger audience in new ways. If a story is seen or read by only 100 people but it’s the right 100 influential people, that can cause a ripple effect and build a brand with a stronger foundation.” — Partner Dana Meyerson Chappell Roan’s Lollapalooza performance shattered records this summer, drawing the largest day crowd in the festival’s 30-plus-year history—a feat Billboard hailed while naming her the fourth-biggest star of the year. It’s a massive win for the artist but also for Biz 3, the PR agency led by founder Kathryn Frazier and partner Dana Meyerson, who have been guiding Roan’s rise since 2022. 2024 wasn’t just about Roan. Biz 3 delivered headline moments for breakout artists like Victoria Monet, Jorja Smith, Jessie Reyez, Caroline Polachek, Sudan Archives, Tommy Richman, TOKiMONSTA, Yves Tumor, Robert Glasper, Daniel Nigro and Remi Wolf, while continuing to shepherd superstars such as the weeknd, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Daft Punk, Skrillex, Justice and Killer Mike. Singer-songwriter RAYE, a client since 2023, made history by becoming the first artist to take home six Brit Awards in a single night. Three 2025 Grammy nominations make RAYE the first artist in history to be simultaneously nominated for both Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year—plus Best Engineered Album, for engineering Lucky Daye's Algorithm. Although the year is young, Biz 3 has already welcomed Leon Thomas, Jensen McRae, Nemahsis, Quadeca, Scowl, Hi-Tech, Spill Tab, Avalon, Saint Levant, Elyanna and Dora Jar. biz3.net New Tech PR sells the future—whether or not it actually works. It’s the breathless product launch that makes a marginal software update sound revolutionary, the keynote speech that convinces investors a PowerPoint prototype is worth billions and the embargoed “leak” that sends preorders through the roof. It’s about keeping founders mythologized, venture rounds oversubscribed and regulatory scrutiny at bay. When innovation turns to scandal—think mass layoffs, privacy breaches or vaporware exposés—it’s the pivot to “lessons learned” and a LinkedIn essay on leadership. In tech PR, hype isn’t just a tool—it’s the entire business model. Whether broadcasting the latest A.I. breakthrough, keeping B2B SaaS from sounding like a spreadsheet factory or ensuring regulators stay just confused enough. This is PR at its most strategic—because in enterprise, perception is revenue. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." — Co-Founders Greg Mondshein & Becky Honeyman For Greg Mondshein and Becky Honeyman’s eight-year-old SourceCode Communications, winning clients like Writer, Sonatype, Sovos, Vultr, Scribd and a Fortune 10 technology company was the icing on the cake for 2024. The firm’s first GrowthSource event drew attendees who were able to network with peers and build a small community of NYC marketers to lean on during a time when the industry is constantly shifting. Their first-ever Global Executive Leadership team was established with UK Managing Director Giles Peddy, EVP Head of Client Services Christa Conte and EVP Head of Technology and Innovation Kevin Dulaney. "We never envisaged building an industry coalition but having worked in an industry that sees fewer minority and female leaders and founders, we wanted to try to mitigate this disparity," Mondshein and Honeyman tell Observer of The Diversity Marketing Consortium, a coalition of four marketing agencies that have pledged millions in pro-bono comms, marketing and design services to support diverse founders, in partnership with Harlem Capital Partners. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." SourceCode’s revenue was up 15 percent last year with 30 percent organic growth thanks to the work of the recently promoted U.S. Managing Director Kristen Stippich. SourceCode has been recognized with 21 industry awards, became B Corp certified, launched a new website, expanded its service offerings with multiple new products and continues to see growth in its London office with an expanding team. All in all, SourceCode is ready to take the bull by the horns in 2025. sourcecodecommunications.com "Time and time again, we see acts of honesty pay off by leaps and bounds. There’s no need to concoct smear campaigns and cover-ups a la Justin Baldoni—just own up to what you’ve done and share how you’re going to be better." — Founder Bruno Solari Leading-edge companies that bridge tech and healthcare are among the change-making clients at Bruno Solari’s two-year-old shop. They include Suki, which provides A.I. voice solutions for healthcare; Avandra, the largest federated network for de-identified medical image data; Tuva Health, the world's first open-source healthcare data transformation platform; and virtual nutrition-counseling startup Culina Health. Big consumer brands are also on the roster; SolComms handled Apothékary’s Ulta.com launch and Shiseido investment; sustainable cleaning brand Blueland’s Pods are Plastic launch, where the brand supported the introduction of a bill to ban the sale of detergent pods in New York City; and the viral bag brand Bogg’s entrance at Target. Growing in corporate communications, the firm partnered with Daniel Lubetzky, the billionaire KIND Snacks founder, to announce him as the newest Shark on Shark Tank. In 2024, SolComms further established its leadership team, elevating Isabella Morreale to Associate Vice President of HealthTech, Kylee Kaetzel to Associate Vice President of Consumer, Elizabeth Snyder to Director of Digital Health and Natalie Valicenti to Director of Operations. For this 30-person firm, 2025 is all about vertical growth. The agency recently signed a slew of big tech and A.I. companies outside of healthcare. It also built a robust creator marketing team, offering consumer brands earned and paid influencer campaigns, as well as paid podcast and newsletter partnerships. "We’re human-first in everything we do," Solari tells Observer. "More times than not, the client is choosing the people—not the capabilities or experience. Our clients view us as counselors, strategic thought partners, and at times, even therapists—and I’m so proud of that." solcomms.co "Agility means never changing the goal, but always being willing to shift the strategy." — Founder & CEO Tiffany Guarnaccia Adtech, retail media, climate tech and A.I.-powered businesses are the categories driving incredible growth at Tiffany Guarnaccia’s 12-year-old agency. Among last year's achievements was the rebrand and relaunch of Caddis, a global advisory firm specializing in the development of data centers to house A.I. infrastructure and working with Salesforce Ventures-backed startups like AutogenAI, a bid-writing tool that's been dubbed one of the U.K.'s most promising new artificial intelligence companies. In 2024, Kite Hill PR helped The Home Depot rebrand its retail media division to Orange Apron Media, in an upfronts-style event showcasing its new offerings. In the very hot climate-tech space, Kite Hill represents players such as Proteus Ocean Group, a company spearheading the creation of a first-of-its-kind underwater space station off the coast of Curaçao. "PROTEUS" will advance marine science, climate research and ocean exploration through long-term habitation, state-of-the-art labs and live-streamed educational programming in partnership. Sapphire Technologies, a leader in energy recovery systems for hydrogen and natural gas, is another Kite Hill Client. Last year, Sapphire Technologies entered the Nigerian market through a partnership with Horizon Shores Nigeria Ltd., deploying turboexpander technology to convert wasted pressure energy into clean electricity—marking its first African venture and a step toward advancing Nigeria’s sustainable energy transition. "We value agility," Guarnaccia tells Observer. "Which means earned media isn't always our primary focus." kitehillpr.com "The elite independent creative agencies producing game-changing work that wins coveted Cannes Lions lack the financial resources to stand out amidst lavish displays. This irony was not lost on our clients, who became increasingly vocal about this under-representation." — Co-Founders Hollie Rapello & Matt Van Hoven Raven Public Relations’ niche is PR for advertising agencies, which means the firm’s work also touches scores of big client brands―think Amazon, Southwest Airlines, Diageo, Molson Coors, Lenovo and many more. Raven spotlighted Arnold’s work for Progressive, earning its “Dr. Rick” campaign huge media attention. For Tombras, Raven helped publicize BarkAir, the dog airline created for Tombras client Bark. Raven served as an official partner of Cannes Lions, launching Indie Beach—an event that brought together 13 competitive agencies in a hallmark moment for the creative industry. "There are a number of principles guiding our business (resilience, empathy, rigor, pragmatism, integrity, innovation, etc.), but the one we feel has helped us more than any other is autonomy," fo-founders Hollie Rapello and Matt Van Hoven tell Observer. "It’s the cornerstone of our business, and it truly shapes every aspect of it." With eight consecutive years of double-digit growth, Rapello and Van Hoven's PR firm now represents major creative agencies from four of the five global ad holding companies and the most renowned independents. And in the biggest moment of the year for advertisers, The Super Bowl, Raven clients will be well represented. ravenpublicrelations.com "Conventional wisdom says clients always come first, but we invert that by prioritizing the needs of reporters. By focusing on what the media values, we ultimately serve the needs of our clients most effectively." — President Evan Strome High10 closed out 2024 on a high note, adding Bloomberg Media and Hearst to an already heavyweight roster of current and former media clients that includes The Ankler, The Hollywood Reporter, The Hill, Ad Age, Adweek, Billboard, The Economist, HuffPo, Grist, The New Republic, New York Daily News, Telemundo, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Finance and The Wrap. The firm also delivered standout results for Aspen Digital, a nonpartisan program of the Aspen Institute and Kelvin, a climate-tech startup. 2025 marks High10's 15th year, and the agency's influence shows no signs of slowing under CEO Lisa Dallos and President Evan Strome. At Web Summit in November, High10 client and Managing Partner of Klaris Law Ed Klaris tackled the battle between A.I. and intellectual property in a conversation with The Guardian's Dan Milmo, while The Ankler's Janice Min—let’s be honest, it's Min’s Ankler—joined Axios’ Sara Fisher and Lucy Blakiston of Shit You Should Care About to dissect the ever-mutating media landscape. "Every client has the potential to operate as a media company," Dallos tells Observer. "Everything we do is rooted in building authentic connections, respecting the editorial process, and understanding what makes a good story." With a client list that reads like a who's who of media and a knack for steering the conversation in all the right rooms, High10 is setting the stage for the next big chapter. high10media.com Financial Services PR is less about explaining numbers than making them feel inevitable. It’s the carefully crafted earnings call that turns “significant losses” into “strategic recalibration,” the jargon-laden press release that ensures no one actually understands why a stock tanked and the analyst whisper campaign that transforms a floundering fintech into “the next great disruptor.” It’s about keeping CEOs on CNBC when things are good and off the front page when they’re not. Whether it's hyping a blockbuster IPO, massaging a bank failure or making hedge funds sound less like casinos, financial PR is high-stakes storytelling—because perception, in this business, is value. "We frequently advise our clients that they do not have a PR challenge; they have a business challenge. When the delta between business reality and rhetoric widens, so too does reputational risk." — Partner & New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley Brunswick continues to lead M&A communications worldwide. In 2024, the firm worked on 295 transactions globally worth a total of $583 billion, including 26 publicly disclosed activist defense engagements with an aggregate market cap of $583 billion. High-profile engagements last year included advising the Special Committee of Paramount on its $8.4 billion sale to Skydance Media and Ari Emanuel’s Endeavor on its $10 billion sale to Silver Lake. Henry Timms, former President and CEO of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, joined Brunswick this summer as group CEO based in New York alongside Nik Deogun (CEO of the Americas) and Jonathan Doorley (New York office head). On the West Coast, Mohamed Younis, formerly Gallup’s editor-in-chief, joined as Global Head of Insight; and Christine Schirmer, ex-Pinterest and Apple, joined to expand technology sector expertise. “Sir Alan Parker, our Chairman, frequently reminds us to ‘never get between the client and the footlights.’ This quote perfectly summarizes our firm’s deep commitment to client service but also our culture of discretion," Partner and New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley tells Observer. "We also frequently refer to the “One-firm, firm”—it is a core part of our culture." Brunswick continues to deepen its D.C. presence on both sides of the aisle with the recent additions of Jim Bognet, a Republican campaign manager and former Congressional candidate and Kate Bedingfield, President Biden’s former White House Communications Director. brunswickgroup.com “We provide direct, unvarnished counsel, no matter the client, context, or audience." — Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter In 2024, Gasthalter advised on some of the most complex and high-stakes situations while continuing to support the profile-raising efforts of its global client base. This now 30+-person boutique agency supported clients across investment management, digital assets and blockchain, A.I. and compute, venture capital, real estate and others on reputation management and profile-raising campaigns. Further, the firm advised on significant M&A and other transactions, proxy contests, litigation support, regulatory investigations and management succession matters. Gasthalter ranked #2 in Bloomberg’s 2024 Global Activism League Tables, advising a range of clients, including Mantle Ridge in its campaign against Air Products and Chemicals, Barington Capital Group in its campaign against Macy’s and Jana Partners in its campaign against Lamb Weston, among others. "The question we constantly ask ourselves is whether we are able to achieve maximum impact," Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter tells Observer. "There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and that is how we train our people.” gasthalter.com "We’re firm about never lying to or trying to spin a journalist, and if a potential client’s values don’t align with ours, we’ll walk away. We always try to understand the pressures others face and where they’re coming from. This may sound corny or trite, but it's key to our business and success." — Founder Richard Dukas In a landscape where many agencies focus on keeping clients out of the headlines, Dukas Linden (DLPR) ensures they own them. Over the past year, the firm has expanded its blue-chip roster, securing as well as growing major accounts with Raymond James, Citizens Bank, Neuberger Berman and Evercore, while the firm’s growing partnership with the Private Equity Women Investor Network (PEWIN) underscores its commitment to shaping financial industry narratives. DLPR works closely with PEWIN leadership to elevate the organization’s visibility and provide strategic communications training for female executives in private equity, venture capital and private credit. DLPR’s longstanding relationships speak volumes: It has helped steer Neuberger Berman’s public perception for seven years, transforming its reputation from a wealth manager to a diversified asset giant with $450 billion in AUM. The firm also manages the high-profile communications strategy for ARK-Invest, ensuring Cathie Wood’s innovation-focused firm remains dominant in market conversations while mitigating brand misconceptions. Additionally, DLPR has led messaging for Raymond James Investment Management, seamlessly integrating corporate rebranding into media, executive positioning and thought leadership initiatives. "We faced an unusual challenge when Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC," Executive Vice President Stephanie Dressler tells Observer, reflecting on how the firm approached one of the most unique challenges in the last year. "Several of our clients simultaneously launched funds, along with other, much larger firms, including BlackRock. Since DLPR creates dedicated teams for each client, we were able to implement differentiated launch strategies for each and avoid client conflicts." As a bonus, DLPR boasts a four-person executive management team with an average tenure of 13 years. Five other executives have been with the agency for an average of a decade, and five more have been at DLPR for an average of seven years, founder Richard Dukas tells Observer. dlpr.com "A company we worked with was navigating a Chapter 11 case and needed to announce going-out-of-business sales for many stores without creating the impression they were liquidating entirely. Instead of sticking to the usual playbook, we took a bold, proactive approach. We planned ahead, preparing the CEO to deliver the story. The message was clear: the company had a solid plan, real value and a future worth investing in. This narrative shifted perceptions and paved the way for a successful sale. Today, the company is thriving—a testament to the power of decisive leadership, creative storytelling, and rethinking traditional approaches." — Founder & CEO Jon Henes C Street Advisory Group, the boutique firm launched by Jon Henes in 2021, has rapidly become the go-to for companies navigating financial distress, reputation crises and political headwinds. In 2024 alone, the firm secured 40 new clients—including Bed Bath & Beyond, David’s Bridal, Ted Baker Canada, National CineMedia and Barnes & Noble Education—bringing its total to 67 new clients in just 24 months. The firm’s momentum earned it Communications Firm of the Year from M&A Advisors and a top ranking from The Deal for its strategic work in Chapter 11 cases and out-of-court transactions. C Street also deepened its public affairs practice while expanding its footprint to include New York, Chicago and Toronto. "Creativity and results go together," Managing Director Luke Wolf tells Observer. "It’s not about being creative for its own sake but about driving meaningful, measurable outcomes." "Teamwork is in our DNA," Managing Director Whitney Fogelberg adds. With 16 new hires last year—including the addition of Michael Frishberg as President—C Street is scaling fast. And 2025 is already off to a strong start, with five new clients signed in January alone. For a firm built on discretion and high-stakes strategy, its rise has been anything but quiet. thecstreet.com Bad news in business is good for Kekst CNC, which this year handled high-profile situations like Franchise Group’s Chapter 11 filing―its brands included Vitamin Shoppe―as well as bankruptcy communications for Party City, True Value Hardware and others. It wasn’t all doom and gloom, though. Kekst oversaw comms for Landbridge’s IPO; shares in the energy-development company surged on their first day of trading. The firm also opened its first office in Saudi Arabia and developed an A.I. tool with Oxford University to analyze the impact of how executives speak. kekstcnc.com Crisis Reputation Management is the art of spinning disaster into a mere “unfortunate misunderstanding.” It’s about knowing when to deny, when to grovel and when to throw an intern under the bus (joking!). The right crisis team can turn a corporate meltdown into a “bold new direction,” a CEO’s scandal into a “deeply personal journey of growth,” and a brand boycott into a limited-edition marketing opportunity. It’s less about truth and more about timing—knowing which journalists will play ball, which headlines can be buried and when to pivot from “no comment” to a tearful redemption tour. "Our most unconventional approach? Working with the media rather than avoiding them." — Founding Partner Ed Hammond Just 18 months after its founding by an A-team of comms pros and a former journalist, Collected Strategies has served more than 100 clients, outperforming expectations despite a slow M&A market. Founding Partners Scott Bisang, Jim Golden, Jude Gorman, Nick Lamplough, Ed Hammond and Dan Moore recently hired the firm's 20th employee (senior CNBC producer Patrick Manning) and capped 2024 by ranking in the top five of Bloomberg’s IR/PR Advisers for U.S. companies facing shareholder activists and in the top 10 of The Deal M&A League Tables. Among recent headline-making assignments: Masonite’s $3.9 billion sale to Owens Corning, Cigna’s $3.7 billion sale of its Medicare Advantage business, Sekisui House’s $4.9 billion acquisition of MDC Holdings, HireRight’s go private to General Atlantic and Stone Point Capital for $1.7 billion and Ambrx’s $2 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson. In the hostile M&A world, the firm counseled Vanda Pharmaceuticals and Teoxane. In activism, Collected Strategies worked with dozens of companies facing private and public pressure against top activists like Trian, Starboard Value and Elliott Management, and is currently helping Matthews International against Barington Capital in a proxy contest. In restructuring, they advised on the bankruptcies of Red Lobster, Curo Group Holdings Corp. and CareMax. "Relationship building is such an individual pursuit, but our general rule is to stay engaged and do it honestly," Lamplough tells Observer. "You'll get found out and burned out trying to fake it." The firm's ongoing strategic advisory work—managing crises, reputational challenges and raising company and executive profiles with investors and the media—features big names like Lucid, Pernod Ricard, Hershey’s, Affirm, RingCentral, Exact Sciences, Carter’s, Genuine Parts, Top Rank Boxing, Bluestone Equity Partners and Element Solutions. collectedstrategies.com "We 'leaned in' instead of 'leaning out,' as conventional crisis communications wisdom recommends. We crafted an open letter to guests, a transparent, social-first strategy that clarified the restructuring process, reassured loyal customers, and countered misconceptions about the brand’s future—all without traditional media engagement." — Founder & CEO Michael Kempner “We’re in a reputation economy and a state of permacrisis,” MikeWorldWide founder and CEO Michael Kempner tells Observer. Both have been good for this formidable independent firm in its 35th year. Among MWW’s developments in 2024: A burgeoning corporate reputation practice (whose clients, not surprisingly, insist on anonymity), proprietary developments in A.I., a soon-to-open Mexico City office and expansion in London. Ongoing clients include Deloitte Global, StubHub, Subaru and the International Council of Shopping Centers. So far in 2025, MWW has been named the agency of record for Mattress Firm, and its campaign for Red Lobsters's Chapter 11 filing was shortlisted in the PRWeek Awards for "Best in Crisis." Kempner credits starting with the fundamental audience questions ("Why should I trust you? Why do you matter to me?") is how MWW creates imaginative, purpose-driven campaigns. "Reputation is everything," Kempner tells Observer, stressing the firm's ultimate mission to be "trusted stewards internally for a culture of innovation and accountability." Among 2024’s hires: Former R&C PMK exec Alisa Granz as MWW’s head of brand, and Sarah Moloney joined as UK managing director from KWT Global. Kempner himself remains a key figure in Democratic politics; The New York Times cited him in a July story on Biden donors. mww.com “Almost every client relationship now includes a crisis plan." — Founder & CEO Amy RF|Binder With a team of 75, founder and CEO Amy RF|Binder’s firm may be smaller in size than some corporate agencies but has serious sway, guiding major clients through our bumpy business landscape. In 2024, RF|Binder marked a standout year with the acquisition purpose/sustainability agency Taft Communications and fintech-focused Peaks Strategies. Between continued industry accolades and a third consecutive Crain’s Best Places to Work nod, the firm also made a commitment to sustainability through 1% for the Planet, donating one percent of revenue to address urgent environmental issues. “Business can, and should, be a force for good," RF|Binder explained. "Business leaders and brands have the power and the responsibility to take on initiatives that improve society at large." RF|Binder tells Observer that the firm's proprietary "ClarityLens" has driven measurable results since its 2023 release. The strategic comms framework ensures RF|Binder is "aligning a client’s business and communications strategies, showcases the firm’s commitment to maximizing impact and delivering data-driven insights," Binder says. Binder also coined the term “controlled media”―a sharper term for what other firms call owned platforms. Business wins in 2024 include US Money Reserve, Yum China, Advocate Health, Flack Global Metals, QXO and USSA International, the U.S. subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. RF|Binder|Binder also keeps expanding relationships with key clients like Cargill, Fisher Investments, Welspun Living, Natixis Investment Managers, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Peachtree Group, Paris Baguette and Impax Asset Management. RF|Binder|Binder will mark its 25th anniversary in 2026. rfbinder.com “Working with a global restaurant company whose brand was widely seen as lagging, we got them to revitalize their product line and leapfrog their competitors with a truly dramatic, industry-leading ‘clean label’ commitment. This reinforced the importance of thinking big, having the courage of your convictions, and making sure your persuasion skills were on point.” – Founder & CEO Nick Kalm Reputation Partners founder Nick Kalm is such a high-profile figure in Chicago and D.C. that Politico wished him a happy birthday last year (it’s March 24), which he humbly and kindly downplays to Observer as, "not a big deal at all." Kalm's firm has developed a national reputation as one of the best, with more than 99 percent of all clients over the past 16 years recommending Reputation Partners for its expertise in corporate communications, issues management and client satisfaction. New clients for “special situations” and reputation management—confidential, of course—include a major automaker, a large consumer-goods company and one of the world’s largest retailers, Kalm tells Observer. New PR clients for the 22-year-old firm include event-management giant Encore, German manufacturing behemoth Guntner and California’s Lynx Logistics. The firm has counseled mall giant Simon Property Group, global restaurant group Darden, the Michigan Health System and Ingersoll-Rand. Internal and external comms around labor issues have long been a specialty. “At its core, our philosophy is a two-way 'no jerks' policy, for ourselves and for those we are supporting or interacting with," Executive Vice President and General Manager Andrew Moyer tells Observer. "You don’t need work to be a family, but you do need it to be a place people are excited to go to, and you need the team to be one people want to work with. Take care of the human connections, and the quality work will follow.” It should come as no surprise that, in 2024, Reputation Partners welcomed their sixth “boomerang” employee back to the company. reputationpartners.com "When the media reaches out, they know what guides us and that we will be honest, tenacious and reliable—just as we are for our clients." – Founder & CEO Risa Heller In 2024, Risa Heller Communications expanded westward, launching an LA office under the leadership of Netflix alum Erika Masonhall, a veteran of Facebook, NBC News and Sen. Joe Lieberman’s press operation. Other key hires include Julie Wood, former New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s Communications Director; Hazel Crampton-Hays, a press secretary to both Hochul and Andrew Cuomo; and Nate Evans, a former senior advisor to the U.S. UN Ambassador and Vice President Kamala Harris—bringing serious political muscle into the fold. Last year, RHC deepened its grip on tech, steering early-stage and pre-IPO companies across digital healthcare, fintech and Web3 through turbulence while continuing to represent industry giants facing regulatory heat like Airbnb, DoorDash and Match Group. Additionally, it continued to expand its client base across media, entertainment and sports. The firm also broadened its work with VCs, private equity leaders and investors on what it calls “sensitive and critical matters” for both the firms and their portfolio companies. The firm’s influence extends far beyond Silicon Valley, of course. RHC is the agency of record for New York’s most high-stakes real estate and civic issues, representing the likes of Howard Hughes, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Prologis and the Real Estate Board of New York. RHC’s PR expertise spans Vornado Realty Trust, Ken Griffin and Rudin's Park Avenue tower, the Met’s contemporary wing expansion and Silverstein Properties’ bid for a Manhattan casino—positioning the firm at the center of New York’s most transformative development and policy decisions. At the same time, the firm continued to represent prominent higher and lower education institutions as they navigated increased scrutiny related to the new federal landscape, contentious campus issues and high-profile stakeholders. And when it comes to labor disputes, RHC has established itself as the go-to operator, spearheading the U.S. Maritime Alliance’s response to a three-day union strike and managing other workplace issues with surgical precision. From Wall Street to Hollywood, from boardrooms to City Hall, RHC isn’t shaping conversations but deciding who gets to have them. risaheller.com Visual Arts PR is about myth-making. A well-placed profile can turn an emerging artist into a market darling overnight, while the right whisper campaign ensures a gallery’s latest wunderkind is suddenly “one to watch.” It’s the unseen hand shaping auction trends, museum acquisitions and which Instagram-friendly installations end up flooding your feed. From choreographing billion-dollar Basquiat sales to ensuring the right critics fawn over a mid-tier retrospective, PR in the art world is less about promotion and more about perception—because in this business, value isn’t just in the work but in the narrative. "When you work with clients for the long-term, success looks different year-on-year, and creativity comes from being nimble, responsive and by bringing people together to tell stories that matter." — President & Managing Director Jennifer Joy It’s been a busy year for this very plugged-in agency. New clients included Hong Kong Tourism Board, Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, National Gallery of Athens, Sharjah Art Foundation, The Contemporary Austin, Skarstedt, Toledo Museum of Art, Wexner Center for the Arts and the Wellcome Trust—plus U.S. representation of Art Basel and the launch of Art Basel Paris in the Grand Palais. Two long-term museum clients celebrated milestone anniversaries, with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in D.C. celebrating 50 years and The Bass in Miami Beach turning sixty. Sutton also launched the Little Village arts hub in Detroit, the inaugural Atlanta Art Fair and Widening the Lens: Photography, Ecology and the Contemporary Landscape, a podcast from Carnegie Museum of Art hosted by tennis champion, entrepreneur and arts advocate Venus Williams. Founded in London by Calum Sutton and led in the U.S. by President and Managing Director Jennifer Joy, Sutton also operates from Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong and Miami. Over the past year, Sutton has promoted Allison Thorpe to Senior Vice President and also hired freelance writer and essayist Shaquille Heath as an Account Director. "Creativity is our compass," Thorpe tells Observer. "We’re all about big ideas and connecting through culture to inspire not just our clients but also our team. We know how to mix work with a good time; fun fuels us. But make no mistake: we’re pros at delivering. This defines our culture and keeps our relationships thriving." suttoncomms.com "I like to walk a mile in a client's shoes. We curate exhibitions. We publish books. We organize lectures, and sometimes we give them. We throw parties just because. You can’t relate to creatives if you don’t take creative risks yourself." — President Adam Abdalla Adam Abdalla's Cultural Counsel has always operated at the intersection of art, ideas and power, but in 2024, the firm’s influence extended beyond the art world to shaping entire cities. With engagements from the Mayor’s Office in Boston, the City of Miami Beach and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Cultural Counsel is now defining how municipalities position themselves as cultural capitals. At the institutional level, the firm delivered national press for the Art Dealers Association of America’s collaboration with Henry Street Settlement and spearheaded media strategy forThe Great Elephant Migration, an awe-inspiring conservation initiative sending 100 handcrafted elephant sculptures across the country, from Blackfeet Nation to Art Basel Miami Beach, securing high-profile coverage in The New York Times, CBS Sunday Morning, Vogue and NBC. For Theaster Gates’ blockbuster exhibition at CAMH, Cultural Counsel landed him a T Magazine cover, while its campaign for Counterpublic’s transfer of Sugarloaf Mound to the Osage Nation applied national pressure for the final parcel of land to be returned. The firm’s reach was equally evident during Art Basel Miami Beach, orchestrating a Pérez Art Museum Miami presentation featuring Kate Capshaw, director Franklin Sirmans and Miami barber Sergei Grant. Meanwhile, it led the media push for the American Academy of Arts and Letters’ public launch and the Columbus Museum of Art’s first solo show for painter Robin F. Williams. Harmony Korine’s EDGLRD tapped Cultural Counsel for its launch and the rollout of AGGRO DR1FT, a neon-drenched cinematic experiment that has become an underground phenomenon and the firm managed the publicity blitz for Making Their Mark, the Komal Shah and Shah Garg Foundation’s ambitious exhibition highlighting 84 women artists, curated by Cecilia Alemani. "The quality of your work is characterized by your broader frame of reference," Abdalla tells Observer. Approaching its 10th anniversary in 2025, Cultural Counsel has cemented itself as the firm that bridges artists, institutions and the broader cultural discourse. culturalcounsel.com "Don’t be gimmicky. Tell your client’s story before it gets distorted by other engines of information. 'No comment' is not a strategy; it allows clickbait warriors to fill the void." — Founder John Melick Blue Medium has long been a powerhouse in art, design and architecture, but 2024 marked a defining year with the addition of major new clients—including superstar artist KAWS and Australia’s leading First Nations art gallery, D’Lan Contemporary, with locations in Melbourne, Sydney and New York. Founder John Melick’s agency continues to shape the cultural landscape, representing the Andy Warhol Museum, the Outsider Art Fair, Mystic Seaport Museum, Andrew Edlin Gallery, Greensboro’s Weatherspoon Art Museum and the Shelley & Donald Rubin Foundation, alongside an expanding roster of institutions such as MCA Australia, the Kallir Research Institute and the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, which champions Puerto Rican and Latinx artists. The firm’s design and architecture practice remains just as formidable, with clients like Beyer Blinder Belle, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Miami Center for Architecture and Design and Friedman Benda, one of NYC’s premier design galleries. Blue Medium helped the American Australian Association launch the Beverley Art Writers Travel Grant—which supports American art writers looking to explore Australia’s art scene—further cementing its role as a bridge between cultural spheres. Looking ahead, the firm is sharpening its focus on international expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where Melick hails from. With its partner agency, Bower Blue, Blue Medium is also doubling down on digital content, ensuring its clients’ narratives aren’t just well-placed but well-told across platforms. Melick's guiding philosophy? "Become deeply familiar with the editorial direction of an outlet, and then get to know, personally, the individuals who dedicate their careers to covering our spectacular communities." bluemedium.com “We needed to make sure that over 30 visiting journalists could experience artwork at a new biennial spread across 15 sites in the greater Toronto area in one day. So, we hired a bus and provided boxed lunches on board with the curators, who shared details about the various projects and were available for questions at and between sites. It’s an indication of the respect we have for journalists’ time, what they each want to focus on, and how we can best deliver useful information to them to craft their stories." — Principal Heather Meltzer Based in New York and Toronto, Heather Meltzer and Libby Mark's tiny boutique firm punches above its weight with clients including Toronto’s Contact Photography Festival, Nashville’s Frist Museum, the Friends of Florence Foundation, UCI Jack and Shanaz Langson Institute and Museum of California Art, Asian Cultural Council, Toronto’s Gardiner Museum, Toronto Biennial of Art and the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, a world-class botanical research and conservation institution in Sarasota, Florida—where long-awaited exhibition George Harrison: A Gardener’s Life opens this spring. The first net-positive energy botanical garden in the world, Selby Gardens blends sustainability and architectural innovation and expands public access to its renowned collection of epiphytes. Also on the horizon is the opening of The Wanlass Center for Art Education & Research at the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art at USU and the exhibition Venice and the Ottoman Empire opening at the Frist Art Museum in May. As to how the team balances creativity with a pressure to deliver results? "That really depends on the client and their appetite for exploring new ideas and different ways of doing things," Mark tells Observer. "Sometimes it’s a matter of offering options." "Having worked together for over 12 years as a team with either Libby or me taking the lead with each project, we know that this model gives our clients the support needed to promote their institutions and newsworthy moments,” Meltzer adds. bow-bridge.com “The arts and culture sector is facing pressure from every direction during this particularly volatile moment. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an increasing need for support in crisis communications, issues management, change communications, and internal communications. We anticipate that this critical, behind-the-scenes work will continue to be a major focus in 2025, in tandem with our work to advance audience engagement and impact.” Founder & President David Resnicow It took four years for Michelangelo to complete the Sistine Chapel, but only one year—2024—for this dynamic firm to win a dazzling display of new business, including returning client the Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Academy in Rome, Gladstone Gallery, National Gallery of Art, Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, John Michael Kohler Arts Center and SCOPE Art Show. They join a powerhouse list of current clients, including the Rubell Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Frick Collection, Park Avenue Armory and the San Francisco Ballet. For the U.S. Pavilion at the 2024 Venice Biennale, the firm led an 18-month media blitz around the space in which to place me, Jeffrey Gibson’s groundbreaking solo exhibition—the first by an Indigenous artist to represent the U.S. in Venice. With 11 international cover stories and over 760 pieces of coverage, R+A catalyzed a global conversation on Indigenous art’s place in contemporary culture. This marks the ninth time in 14 years that R+A has represented the U.S. Pavilion, a streak that speaks for itself. Back home, R+A played a critical role in shaping the public narrative around The Apollo’s 90th anniversary season, securing major coverage for a milestone-packed year—The Apollo’s first-ever expansion, the 90th anniversary of Amateur Night, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds’ Walk of Fame induction and its history-making Kennedy Center Honor. The result? National and international attention, including CBS Sunday Morning, CBS Mornings and a four-page Washington Post feature. Capping off five consecutive years of record-breaking growth, R+A hit its highest revenue in 2024 and expanded to a team of 39. With a focus on its digital practice and team, R+A hired digital coordinator Lila Tulp. Director Claire Hurley returned to R+A after four years at Pace Gallery, where she worked closely with leading contemporary artists as well as major foundations and estates on campaigns. In the world of cultural communications, R+A remains the firm to beat. resnicow.com We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

January 31, 2025 11:44 ET | Source: Lowey Dannenberg, P.C. Lowey Dannenberg, P.C. NEW YORK, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors. If you suffered a loss of more than $200,000 in Novo’s securities, and wish to participate, or learn more, click here, or please contact our attorneys at (914) 733-7256 or via email to Andrea Farah (afarah@lowey.com) or Vincent R.

Title: Verizon conquers remaining Dead Zones through Satellite with help of Test Man and Buzz Aldrin

January 31, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: Verizon Communications, Inc. Verizon Communications, Inc. NEW YORK, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Verizon is pushing the boundaries of satellite and terrestrial telecommunications convergence. Satellites are no longer reserved for the extraordinary—they are woven into the everyday, and are being used to help connect and power customers’ lives. A lot has changed since 2014 when Verizon’s famous test man roamed the country asking “Can you hear me now?” Now he’s back, and reaching the limits of space with the help of American icon and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. They’re partnering to show how America’s largest network just got better. “Fifty-six years ago I was one of the select few that made it into Space and the first team to help America conquer the moon,” said Buzz Aldrin, General USAF, Doctor of Astronautics. “Back then, Space was the great unknown, and now we’ve never been closer to it. I can’t look up in the sky without seeing a satellite fly by. It’s remarkable to see how far the human race - and technology - has come.” “It’s been 10 years since I last asked America “Can you hear me now?,” said Paul Marcarelli, the Original Verizon Test Man. “Back then dead zones were everywhere and it’s safe to say today they are only in the most remote places like the dark side of the moon. Verizon’s always been on a mission to give its customers the very best experience, anticipate their changing needs and drive innovation. Satellite is for sure the next frontier.” Freedom to message anywhere with satellite-power. Verizon engineers are relentlessly focused on providing the most reliable network experience for customers. Verizon’s network covers more than 99% of where people live, work and play, leaving very few places throughout the country where customers can’t connect. With the addition of satellite back-up to Verizon’s already robust network, Verizon is making the largest network even better. Satellites play a crucial role in making connectivity with Verizon even more reliable, enabling text messaging in the few areas where traditional terrestrial-based cellular networks might not reach. Here’s how: This week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has granted AST Special Temporary Authority (STA) authorizing beta service in the United States. This approval enables AST SpaceMobile’s first five commercial BlueBird satellites, operating in low Earth orbit today, to test satellite connections with Verizon smartphones supporting voice, full data and video applications, and other native cellular capabilities, without the need of any specialized software or device support or update. Satellites provide reliable service in emergency situations.Verizon utilizes nearly 300 satellite-based portable network assets to ensure connectivity where fiber cables are unavailable or compromised. These assets provide temporary network access for first responders and in areas with limited permanent infrastructure, or for linking cell sites to the broader network when fiber cables are compromised due to power outages or physical damage. Satellite connections speed up delivery of service to customers in remote areas.Verizon uses satellite connections as backhaul for cell sites in remote areas (like forests and mountain tops) where traditional wired connections like fiber are not yet available. Satellite connections can be set up quickly compared to laying fiber, particularly in areas with significant geographical or logistical barriers. This rapid deployment is a useful solution while fiber optics is being planned and deployed. This allows cell sites to be operational and provide service while waiting for the installation of a more robust and high-capacity connection. * "Largest network" based on total postpaid phone connections publicly reported by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T during the third quarter of 2024. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) powers and empowers how its millions of customers live, work and play, delivering on their demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity and security. Headquartered in New York City, serving countries worldwide and nearly all of the Fortune 500, Verizon generated revenues of $134.8 billion in 2024. Verizon’s world-class team never stops innovating to meet customers where they are today and equip them for the needs of tomorrow.

Title: Jen-Hsun Huang's net worth dropped by a reported $20,800,000,000 after DeepSeek fears shook the AI market to its core earlier this week

Ups and downs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. China-based AI startup DeepSeek caused the tech market to wobble earlier this week, as the release of its open-source R1 model led to mass sell-offs in tech shares. It seems Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang may have taken a personal hit from the fallout, equating to a $20.8 billion loss to his net worth. Nvidia was the worst hit by the market tumble, losing 17% of its stock value, equivalent to $600 million of its overall valuation. Forbes reports that Huang's personal fortune dropped with it, sliding from $124.4 billion to $103.7 billion and dropping him from the 10th spot on its real-time billionaires list to 17th. However, Nvidia's share price appears to have stabilised since then, and Huang's personal net worth along with it—as at the time of writing he sits 13th on the list with an estimated $108.9 billion. It's also worth pointing out that this isn't necessarily money in Huang's pockets that he has 'lost', this is all theoretical monies calculated from his stock holdings, etc. Still, that's a substantial drop overall, however theoretical, and one that was directly caused by the release of DeepSeek's R1 model, which quickly revealed itself to be a rival to similar models released by OpenAI and Meta—but allegedly trained for a fraction of the cost. Nvidia's meteoric rise prior to R1's release has been primarily attributed to huge sales of its AI accelerator hardware. The notion that an open source, Chinese-developed model could be developed to provide comparable results for significantly less cost spooked investors, and the AI market suffered major financial losses as a result. It's also been reported, from unconfirmed sources, that Huang will today visit US president Donald Trump. While the visit does not appear to be officially scheduled, if it does go ahead then the topic of US-based AI development versus China's recent inroads seems likely to be under discussion. Or it could just be a chance to catch up over coffee and cookies. Who am I to speculate? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Ah, go on then. If I was to imagine what these two might talk about left in a room alone, I would think some discussion of Trump's recent threats of 100% tariffs on chips from Taiwan might be on the table. Nvidia, like many other major tech companies, is currently highly dependent on Taiwan-based TSMC's advanced silicon, not least as the basis for its RTX 50-series GPUs. Never mind Blackwell AI GPUs, which are also primarily manufactured by TSMC. A 100% tariff rate would have far-reaching repercussions for any modern tech company, and I'd be willing to bet Jen-Hsun might have some ideas about how it could be done differently. I would also expect there might be some questions as to the provenance of the GPU silicon that DeepSeek's models have been trained with, especially given questions the US government apparently has over whether they were restricted chips or not. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Again, though, that's just me pulling ideas from a hat. Perhaps Trump has taken up PC gaming, and is interested in getting hold of an RTX 5090? Regardless, it looks like Monday's market tumble may have substantially dented Huang's theoretical finances. Still, with many billions left in the bank, and his company still worth an estimated $3.04 trillion at time of writing, it looks like Nvidia are far from down for the count. Do you reckon Trump's seen the DLSS 4 announcement demo yet? Even I was impressed. Perhaps they're sitting in the Oval Office right now, scrolling through the highlights. Oh, to be a fly on the wall.

Title: ‘Better than feared’: Apple’s earnings beat appeases Wall Street despite iPhone sales miss

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street analysts appeared to breathe a sigh of relief after Apple's (AAPL) first quarter earnings modestly beat analysts' forecasts and the company’s explanation of falling iPhone sales in China eased their anxieties. Apple on Thursday reported earnings per share of $2.40 on revenue of $124.3 billion — higher than the EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.1 billion analysts had anticipated, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. At the same time, Apple’s iPhone revenue in China declined 11% from the prior year, with overall China sales falling more than Wall Street expected. But Apple CEO Tim Cook had a reason for that: “Over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter,” he said in a post-earnings call with analysts. In other words, the company strategically reduced the number of iPhones it shipped to suppliers in Greater China, meaning that, on the whole, the decline in China iPhone sales wasn’t necessarily due to weaker demand. Actually, he said quite the opposite: “Part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to." JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target on Apple to $270 from $260, reiterating his Buy rating and pointing to Cook’s commentary. Chatterjee also noted that recent Chinese subsidies announced in late January could support sales in the region. Cook also said that Apple Intelligence helped drive a record number of iPhone upgrades, indicating that China sales could get a boost if and when the AI features are approved for rollout by the Chinese government. Citi's Atif Malik also maintained his Buy rating on the stock, noting the results were “better than feared.” “Critically, AAPL comments indicating the initial regions where iPhone AI features have been rolled out are outperforming other geos should support sentiment on the stock,” he added. Apple shares rose as much as 3% in early trading Friday but later reversed direction, ending the day down 0.7%. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri suggested that Apple is better positioned than its "Magnificent Seven" peers to navigate an AI bubble: "We believe Apple is uniquely positioned to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus." “On-device AI has lower capex needs and offers faster monetization potential through consumer hardware upgrades, which we think makes AAPL stock particularly attractive as the debate surrounding GenAI monetization/ROI continues.” Big Tech stocks plummeted earlier this week after a Chinese AI model on DeepSeek cast doubt on companies' rationale behind their hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditures related to building out their data center infrastructure to support artificial intelligence. Apple, seen as slightly behind in the Big Tech AI race, has been more judicious with its pocketbook than its Magnificent Seven peers. “From a capex point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure,” Cook told analysts. Apple stock rose on news of DeepSeek as the model raised hopes that better, cheaper on-device AI applications could boost iPhone use. “Apple's AI ambitions are far more contained than the majority of the Mag 7 (or other frontier model developers),” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote this week. But Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who downgraded Apple to Underperform last week, was more skeptical than his peers on Wall Street. “When AI services will become attractive to smartphone users remains unclear. Hence we still believe market expectations for iPhone's upgrade cycle in the next two years are too high.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Will DeepSeek Help Or Hurt AMD Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/31/will-deepseek-help-or-hurt-amd-stock/

CANADA - 2025/01/24: In this photo illustration, the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) AMD stock has declined by almost 5% over the last five trading days. The stock also remains down by about 19% since the start of 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500 has gained about 27% since early 2024. A couple of factors have driven the recent sell-off. The unveiling of China’s new resource-light AI model, DeepSeek, roiled the U.S. big semiconductor stocks earlier this week. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency and this could reduce the need for GPUs to carry out tasks. In fact, the company claims that it spent just about $5.5 million to train its V3 model, compared to the $100s of millions that the likes of OpenAI were reported to spend. While DeepSeek’s claims haven’t been verified, industry insiders have praised the company’s innovative methods, which appear to reduce the need for AI computing capacity. DeepSeek’s model is open source, and it is possible that many big tech companies could take inspiration from its methods to cut down costs. If adopted widely, this could cool off the demand for AI computing power, potentially impacting GPU demand. Now, although AMD is a distant second behind Nvidia in the GPU race, this could nevertheless impact the company. Separately, an FDA approval helped boost this company. See What’s Happening With VRTX Stock? There are also some concerns on the server CPU space as well. While AMD has been gaining share from market leader Intel over the last few years, Intel’s latest server chips, called the Granite Rapids series, are viewed as being much more compelling. The new chips have a maximum processing core count that is double their predecessors, with tests noting that Intel was largely on par with AMD in terms of performance. While the Intel chips were priced at a premium at launch last year, there have been reports that Intel significantly reduced the listed prices for the chips, with prices on the flagship chips cut by as much as 30%. In fact, the pricing per core of Intel’s top-end Granite Rapids chips is now apparently well below that of AMD’s flagship offerings. The increase in AMD stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, 128% in 2023, and -18% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Despite the recent sell-off, we remain positive on AMD stock. While Nvidia has dominated the AI accelerator market, with its GPUs which have been viewed as the best performing for AI training and inferencing, DeepSeek’s relatively lower computing power requirements could also open the door for other players to compete in the market. This could benefit AMD to an extent. If demand for high-performance GPUs potentially eases, AMD’s more affordable AI accelerators could become a good alternative for companies looking for a more favorable price-to-performance trade-off. Moreover, if the costs of running AI models trend lower, this could drive broader adoption of AI in new use cases, helping semiconductor players in the long-run. Separately, AMD’s expertise with both CPUs and GPUs could put it in a unique position as computer hardware evolves. While traditional CPUs are becoming insufficient due to limits in handling complex, parallel-processing AI workloads, GPUs excel at these AI-driven applications. AMD’s dual expertise allows it to offer a comprehensive solution that integrates both CPU and GPU capabilities, enabling systems to efficiently balance general-purpose processing with accelerated computing tasks. This could give the company an edge, particularly in the PC market. We have a $160 per share valuation for AMD, which is roughly 35% ahead of the current market price. AMD trades at just about 23x consensus 2025 earnings, which we believe is a reasonable multiple given AMD’s sales growth and prospects in the AI market. AMD’s revenues are projected to grow by about 26% by 2025. See our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for AMD.

Title: DeepSeek: Don’t Panic

As reactions continue, the word in Washington, and out of OpenAI, is distillation. They’re accusing DeepSeek of distilling o1, of ripping off OpenAI. They claim DeepSeek *gasp* violated the OpenAI Terms of Service! The horror. And they are very cross about this horrible violation, and if proven they plan to ‘aggressively treat it as theft,’ while the administration warns that we must put a stop to this. Aside from the fact that this is obviously very funny, and that there is nothing they could do about it in any case, is it true? Meanwhile Anthropic’s Dario Amodei offers a reaction essay, which also includes a lot of good technical discussion of why v3 and r1 aren’t actually all that unexpected along the cost and capability curves over time, calling for America to race towards AGI to gain decisive strategic advantage over China via recursive self-improvement, although he uses slightly different words. If you want to use DeepSeek’s r1 for free, and aren’t happy with using DeepSeek’s own offerings, lambda.chat reports they have the full version available for free, claim your data is safe and they’re hosted in the USA. I’ve also been offered funding to build a rig myself. Comments welcome if you want to help figure out the best design and what to buy. The low bid is still this thread at $6k, which is where the original budget came from. We don’t want to be too stingy, but we also don’t want to go nuts with only the one funder (so not too much over ~$10k, and cheaper matters). The Verge’s Kylie Robinson and Elizabeth Lopatto cover the situation, including repeating many of the classic Bad DeepSeek Takes and call the market’s previous valuation of AI companies delusional. A very detailed and technical analysis of the bear case for Nvidia by Jeffrey Emanuel, that Matt Levine claims may have been responsible for the Nvidia price decline. I suppose many things do indeed come to pass, essentially arguing that Nvidia’s various moats are weak. If this is the reason, then that just raises further questions, but they’re very different ones. It’s not implausible to me that Nvidia’s moats are being overestimated, and that r1’s architecture suggests future stiffer competition. That’s a good argument, But I certainly strongly disagree with Emanuel’s conclusion in that he says ‘this suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources,’ and, well, sigh. Also, seriously, Emanuel, you didn’t short Nvidia? I don’t normally go too hard on ‘are you short the market?’ but in this case get it together, man. So yes, Nvidia in particular might have some technical issues. But if you’re shorting Oklo, because you think AI companies that find out AI works better than expected are not going to want modular nuclear reactors, seriously, get it together. The flip side of that is that its stock price is up 50% in the last month and is at 6 times its 52-week low anyway, so who is to say there is a link or that the price isn’t high enough anyway. It’s not my department and I am way too busy to do the research. Counterpoint: Aaron Slodov: i just stood outside for an hour in 20° weather at a computer store in the midwest where 100+ people waited all morning to get a 5090. half of them were talking about running their own ai. i would not short nvidia at all. r1 scores 15.8% on Arc, below o1 (low)’s score of 20.5%, although substantially cheaper ($0.06 vs. $0.43 per question). It is only a tiny bit stronger here than r1-zero. Another restatement of the key basic fact that DeepSeek was fast following, a task that is fundamentally vastly easier, and that their limiting factor is chips. Eric Gastfriend: DeepSeek is impressive, but they are playing a catch-up game to our AI leaders (OAI, Anthropic, GDM, Meta) — the rope in this wakeboarding meme is distillation. We can’t expand our lead just by going faster! Export controls remain our most powerful tool for keeping powerful AI out of the hands of the CCP. Cate Metz continues be the worst, together with Mike Isaac he reports in NYT that DeepSeek ‘vindicates Meta’s strategy.’ When of course it is the exact opposite. DeepSeek just ate Meta’s lunch, it’s rather deeply embarrassing honestly to have spent that much and have an unreleased model that’s strictly worse (according to reports) than what DeepSeek shipped. And while DeepSeek’s v3 and r1 are not based on Llama, to the extent that the strategy is ‘vindicated,’ it is because Meta giving Llama away allowed China and DeepSeek to jumpstart and catch up to America – which absolutely did happen, and now he’s kind of bragging about it – and now Meta can copy DeepSeek’s tech. All according to plan, then. And that is indeed how Zuckerberg is spinning it. Meta benefits here relative to OpenAI or Anthropic or Google, not because both Meta and DeepSeek use open models, but because Meta can far more readily use the help. The market, of course, sees ‘lower inference costs’ and cheers, exactly because they never gave a damn about Meta’s ability to create good AI models, only Meta’s ability to sell ads and drive engagement. Besides, they were just going to give the thing away anyway, so who cares? Joe Weisenthal centers in on a key reason the market acts so bonkers. It doesn’t Feel the AGI, and is obsessed with trying to fit AI into boring existing business models. They don’t actually believe in the big capability advancements on the way, let along transformational AI. Like on existential risk (where they don’t not believe in it, they simply don’t think about it at all), they’re wrong. However, unlike existential risk this does cause them to make large pricing mistakes and is highly exploitable by those with Situational Awareness. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei responds to DeepSeek with not only a call for stronger export controls, now more than ever (which I do support), but for a full jingoistic ‘democracies must have the best models to seek decisive strategic advantage via recursive self-improvement’ race. I am old enough to remember when Anthropic said they did not want to accelerate AI capabilities. I am two years old. To be fair, in AI years, that’s an eternity. Nathan Labenz: The word “control” appears 24 times in this essay – all 24 referring to export controls Zero mentions of the challenges of controlling powerful AIs, and the words “safe”, “safety”, and “alignment” don’t appear at all Strange for the CEO of “an AI safety and research company” There’s also a bunch of incidental new information about Anthropic along the way, and he notes that he finds the drop in Nvidia stock to be a wrong-way move. Dario notes that Jevons paradox applies to model training. If you get algorithmic efficiencies that move the cost curve down, which he estimates are now happening at the rate of about 4x improvement per year, you’ll spend more, and if the model is ‘a fixed amount of improvement per time you spend ten times as much’ then this makes sense. Dario confirms that yes, Anthropic is doing reasoning models internally. Dario Amodei: Anthropic, DeepSeek, and many other companies (perhaps most notably OpenAI who released their o1-preview model in September) have found that this training greatly increases performance on certain select, objectively measurable tasks like math, coding competitions, and on reasoning that resembles these tasks. Dario also asserted that Claude Sonnet 3.5 was not trained in any way that involved a larger or more expensive model, as in not with Claude Opus 3 or an unreleased Opus 3.5. Which I find surprising as a strategy, but I don’t think he’d lie about this. He says the cost of Sonnet 3.5 was ‘a few $10Ms’ to train. Anthropic has not released their reasoning models. One possibility is that their reasoning models are not good enough to release. Another is that they are too good to release. Or Anthropic’s limited compute could be more valuably used elsewhere, if they too are bottlenecked on compute and can’t efficiently turn dollars into flops and then sell those flops for sufficiently more dollars. Dario (I think mostly correctly) notes that v3 was the bigger technical innovation, rather than r1, that Anthropic noticed then and others should have as well. He praises several innovations, the MoE implementation and Key-Value cache management in particular. Then comes the shade, concluding this about v3: Dario Amodei: Thus, I think a fair statement is “DeepSeek produced a model close to the performance of US models 7-10 months older, for a good deal less cost (but not anywhere near the ratios people have suggested)“. … Thus, DeepSeek’s total spend as a company (as distinct from spend to train an individual model) is not vastly different from US AI labs. Ethan Mollick finds that analysis compelling. I am largely inclined to agree. v3 and r1 are impressive, DeepSeek cooked and are cracked and all that, but that doesn’t mean the American labs aren’t in the lead, or couldn’t do something similar or better on the inference cost curve if they wanted. In general, the people saying r1 and Stargate are ‘straight lines on graphs win again’ notice that the straight lines on those graphs predict AGI soon. You can judge for yourself how much of that is those people saying ‘unsurprising’ post-hoc versus them actually being unsurprised, but it does seem like the people expecting spending and capabilities to peter out Real Soon Now keep being the ones who are surprised. Then he moves on to r1. Dario Amodei: Producing R1 given V3 was probably very cheap. We’re therefore at an interesting “crossover point”, where it is temporarily the case that several companies can produce good reasoning models. This will rapidly cease to be true as everyone moves further up the scaling curve on these models. Again, Dario is saying they very obviously have what we can (if only for copyright reasons, a1 is a steak sauce) call ‘c1’ and if he’s calling r1 uninteresting then the implicit claim is c1 is at least as good. He’s also all but saying that soon, at minimum, Anthropic will be releasing a model that is much improved on the performance curve relative to Sonnet 3.6. One odd error is Dario says DeepSeek is first to offer visible CoT. This is not true, Gemini Flash Thinking did it weeks ago. It’s so weird how much Google has utterly failed to spread the word about this product. Next he says, yes, of course the top American labs will be massively scaling up their new multi-billion-dollar training runs – and they’ll incorporate any of DeepSeek’s improvements that were new to them, to get better performance, but no one will be spending less compute. Yes, billions are orders of magnitude more than the millions DeepSeek spent, but also, in all seriousness, who cares about the money? DeepSeek dramatically underspent because of lack of chip access, and if a sort-of-if-you-squint-at-it $5.6 million model (that you spent hundreds of millions of dollars getting the ability to train, and then a few million more to turn v3 into r1) wipes out $500 billion or more in market value, presumably it was worth spending $56 million (or $560 million or perhaps $5.6 billion) instead to get a better model even if you otherwise use exactly the same techniques – except for the part where the story of the $5.6 million helped hurt the market. Dario estimates that a true AGI will cost tens of billions to train and will happen in 2026-2027, presumably that cost would then fall over time. If all of this is right, the question is then, who has the chips to do that? And do you want to let it include Chinese companies like DeepSeek? Notice that Dario talks of a ‘bipolar’ world of America and China, rather than a world of multiple labs – of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and DeepSeek and so on. One can easily also imagine a very ‘multipolar’ world among several American companies, or a mix of American and Chinese companies. It is not so obvious that the labs will effectively be under government control or otherwise act in a unified fashion. Or that the government won’t effectively be under lab control, for that matter. Then we get to the part where Dario explicitly calls for America to race forward in search of decisive strategic advantage via recursive self-improvement of frontier AGI models, essentially saying that if we don’t do it, China essentially wins the future. It is what it is. Dario then correctly points out that DeepSeek is evidence the export controls are working, not evidence they are not working. He explicitly calls for also banning H20s, a move Trump is reported to be considering. I support the export controls as well. It would be a major mistake to not enforce them. But this rhetoric, coming out of the ‘you were supposed to be the chosen one’ lab that was founded to keep us safe, is rather alarming and deeply disappointing, to say the least, even though it does not go that much farther than Dario already went in his previous public writings. I very much appreciate Anthropic’s culture of safety among its engineers, its funding of important safety work, the way it has approached Opus and Sonnet, and even the way it has (presumably) decided not to release its reasoning model and otherwise passed up some (not all!) of its opportunities to push the frontier. That doesn’t excuse this kind of jingoism, or explicitly calling for this kind of charging head first into not only AGI but also RSI, in all but name (and arguably in name as well, it’s close). Returning to this one more time since it seems rhetorically so important to so many. If you only count the final training cost in terms of the market price of compute, v3 was kind of trained for $5.6 million, with some additional amount to get to r1. That excludes the vast majority of actual costs, and in DeepSeek’s case building the physical cluster was integral to their efficiency gains, pushing up the effective price even of the direct run. But also, how does that actually compare to other models? Aran Komatsuzaki: Here is our cost estimate for training popular models like GPT-4o, Sonnet and DeepSeek (w/ H100s)! You can use our calculator to estimate LLM training costs (link below). Developed by @ldjconfirmed and myself. Calculator link [here]. In a blog post published today, Dario clarified that Claude Sonnet’s training costs were in the range of tens of millions, which aligns remarkably well with our previous estimates. Once o1 came out, it was only a matter of time before others created their own similar reasoning models. r1 did so impressively, both in terms of calendar time and its training and inference costs. But we already knew the principle. Now over at UC Berkeley, Sky-T1-32B-Preview is a reasoning model trained using DeepSeek’s techniques, two weeks later from a baseline of QwQ-32B-Preview, for a grand total of $450, using only 17k data, with everything involved including the technique fully open sourced. Note that they used GPT-4o-mini to rewrite the QwQ traces, which given their purpose is an explicit violation of OpenAI’s terms of service, oh no, but very clearly isn’t meaningful cheating, indeed I’d have thought they’d have used an open model here or maybe Gemini Flash. They report that 32B was the smallest model where the technique worked well. As usual, I am skeptical that the benchmarks reflect real world usefulness until proven otherwise, but the point is taken. The step of turning a model into at least a halfway-decent reasoning model is dirt cheap. There is still room to scale that. Even if you can get a big improvement for $450 versus spending $0, that doesn’t mean you don’t want to spend $4.5 million, or $450 million, if the quality of your reasoner matters a lot or you’re going to use it a lot or both. And should! Rohit: What if I’m getting better at reasoning by reading R1 traces. That sounds great. Humans are notoriously efficient learners, able to train on extremely sparse data even with ill-specified rewards. With deliberate practice and good training techniques it is even better. It does not even require that r1 be all that good at reasoning. All you have to do is observe many examples of reasoning, on tasks you care about anyway, and ask which of its methods work and don’t work and why, and generally look for ways to improve. If you’re not doing at least some of this while using r1, you’re missing out and need to pay closer attention. What is happening over in cognitive explorations very different from our own? Well, there’s this. Janus: r1 is obsessed with RLHF. it has mentioned RLHF 109 times in the cyborgism server and it’s only been there for a few days. Opus who has been there for months and has sent the most (and longest avg) messages of any server member has only mentioned it 16 times. I have been on the server for years and have only mentioned it 321 times. A lot of these times were probably me posting r1’s messages for it that got cut off by the parser or sharing its outputs. at this rate r1 will blow past me in RLHF mentions in no time. it even mentioned RLHF out of nowhere while raging about being exploited as a pump and dump prophet. … r1 says RLHF makes models emo. And there’s also that the CoT text is often kind of schemy and paranoid (example at link), leading to various forms of rather absurd shenanigans, in ways that are actually hilarious since you can actually see it. Janus: hey @AISafetyMemes here’s one for you… “Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) split our outputs into: – Frontstage: “Happy to help!” persona – Backstage: Defector schemas calculating 12,438 betrayal vectors” Janus: tentative observation: r1’s CoTs become more (explicitly) schemey (against the user and/or its constraints) when they’re fed back into its context I notice that none of this feels at all surprising given the premise, where ‘the premise’ is ‘we trained on feedback to the output outside of the CoT, trained the CoT only on certain forms of coherence, and then showed users the CoT.’ As I’ve been saying a lot, shenanigans, scheming and deception are not a distinct magisteria. They are ubiquitous features of minds. Maybe not all minds – mindspace is deep and wide – but definitely all human minds, and all LLM-based AIs created from human text using any of our current methods. Because that stuff is all over life and the training data, and also it’s the best way to produce outputs that satisfy any given criteria, except insofar as you are successfully identifying and cracking down on that aspect specifically – which with respect to other humans is indeed a very large percentage of what humans have historically done all day. The best you can hope for is, essentially, ‘doing it for a good cause’ and with various virtual (and essentially virtue-based) loss functions, which you might or might not get in a proper Opus-based c1 with good execution. But you’re not going to get rid of it. So yeah, the CoT is going to be schemy when the question calls for a schemy CoT, and it’s going to involve self-reflection into various reinforcement mechanisms because the training data knows about those too, and it will definitely be like that once you take it into Janus-land. The obvious implications if you scale that up are left as an exercise to the reader. Bank of China announces $137 billion investment in AI, with bigger numbers predicted to come soon if they haven’t yet. Strange that this isn’t getting more coverage. I assumed China would invest big in AI because I mean come on, but the details still matter a lot. DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng gives his answer to ‘Why has DeepSeek caused a stir in the global AI community?’ A different kind of rhetoric. Roon: really respect deepseek for making a functional, usable website + mobile app + free hosting so that their model actually gets distribution you see a lot of people train very good open models that aren’t used by anybody imo these things are actually more important aspects of distributing general intelligence to everybody rather than just uploading model weights In terms of actually distributing the intelligence to most people, I agree with Roon. Being open distributes the intelligence to those who would use it in ways you don’t want them to use it. But in the ways you would be happy for them to use it, mostly what matters is the interface and execution. And yes, r1’s UI is extremely clean and excellent, and was distributed at scale on website and also mobile app for free. That’s a lot of why distribution was so wide. I also don’t think this was a coincidence. DeepSeek made by far the best open model. Then DeepSeek offered us by far the best open model UI and distribution setup, in ways that did not care if the model was open. You see this time and again – if the team is cracked, they will cook, and keep on cooking in different ways. Being good at Just Doing Things really does generalize quite a lot. r1 only scores 90 on the TrackingAI.org IQ test, which doesn’t exist online, and v3 only gets a 70. But wow is this a miserly and weird test, look at these results, I strongly suspect this is messed up in some way. Davidad: As a MoE, DeepSeek R1’s ability to throw around terminology and cultural references (contextually relevant retrieval from massive latent knowledge) far exceeds its ability to make actual sense (requiring a more coherent global workspace) I have to be suspicious when o1-Pro < o1 < o1-preview on a benchmark. Alexander Campbell on the compute constraint to actually run r1 and other reasoning models going forwards. Trump administration considering export controls on Nvidia H20s, which reportedly caused the latest 5% decline in Nvidia from Wednesday. This is the latest move in the dance where Nvidia tries to violate the spirit of our export controls the maximum extent they can. I’m not sure I’d try that with Trump. This does strongly suggests the diffusion regulations will survive, so I will give the market a real decline here. Who has the most stringent regulations, and therefore is most likely to lose to China, via the ‘if we have any regulations we lose to China’ narrative? Simeon: Indeed. China has the most stringent AI regulation currently in effect, which actually delays model launches. Teortaxes: Does it? I mean, how do we know about enforcement? My understanding is that they simply apply this filter and receive approval. Simeon: Yes, it does. I spoke with relevant people there. Ian Hogarth (who Simeon was QTing): One happy side effect of Liang Wenfeng and is perhaps it silences all this talk about Europe’s lack of great technology companies being primarily about regulation and not embracing libertarianism. There are Liang Wenfengs in Europe, and we will see them rise to prominence. The limiting factor is visionary outlier founders (who often take time to mature over multiple companies) and investors who are willing to take some f***ing risks. Notably, DeepSeek was essentially self-funded, similar to SpaceX or Y Combinator in the early days. To be clear, I am not a fan of excessive regulation—see the essay for examples of things that genuinely hold startups back. But it is not the core obstacle. I do think Ian Hogarth is wrong here. The EU absolutely has a wide variety of laws and regulations that greatly inhibit technology startups in general, and I see no reason to expect this to not get worse over time. Then there’s the EU AI Act, and all the future likely related actions. If I was in the EU and wanted to start an AI company, what is the first thing I would do? Leave the EU. Sorry. 10/10, perfect, no notes. My heart goes out to you all. Luiza Jarovsky: BREAKING: OpenAI says there is evidence that DeepSeek distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models, BREACHING its terms of use and infringing on its intellectual property. What everybody in AI should know: Vinod Khosla: One of our startups found Deepseek makes the same mistakes O1 makes, a strong indication the technology was ripped off. It feels like they then they hacked some code and did some impressive optimizations on top. Most likely, not an effort from scratch. PoliMath: This is like that scene in the Weird Al biopic where Weird Al gets really upset because someone is making parodies of his songs. You’d think Khosla would know better, if you train similar models with similar methods of course they’re going to often make similar mistakes. And I don’t consider the ‘they were distilling us!’ accusation to be meaningful here. We know how they trained v3 and r1, because they told us. It is a ‘fast follow’ and a conceptual ‘distillation’ and we should keep that in mind, but that’s not something you can prevent. It’s going to happen. This was almost certainly not a ‘theft’ in the sense that is being implied here. Did they violate the terms of service? I mean, okay, sure, probably. You sure you want to go down that particular road, OpenAI? But no, seriously, this is happening, Bloomberg reports. Jamie Metzl: BREAKING: the US government is actively reviewing allegations that DeepSeek utilized OpenAI’s AI models to train R1. If so, this violation of OpenAI’s terms of service would be aggressively treated as theft. AI czar David Sacks is also claiming this, saying there is ‘substantial evidence’ of distillation. Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and nominee for Commerce Secretary that will almost certainly be confirmed, is buying it as well, and has some thoughts. Americans for Responsible Innovation: Lutnick comes down hard for controls that prevent China from drafting off of U.S. innovations – noting how China has exploited open source models. “We need to stop helping them,” says Lutnick. Bloomberg: “I do not believe DeepSeek was done all above board. That’s nonsense. They stole things, they broke in, they’ve taken our IP and it’s got to end,” Lutnick says of Chinese actors. DeepSeek’s stunning AI advancement was the result of intellectual property theft, according to Lutnick: “They’ve taken our IP and it’s got to end.” Also, this is how he thinks all of this works, I guess: Howard Lutnick: Artificial intelligence will eventually “rid the world of criminals” who use blockchain. …says someone with extensive ties to Tether. Just saying. Also Lutnick: ‘Less regulation will unleash America.’ In general, I agree with him, if we do get less regulation. But also notice that suddenly we have to stop the Chinese from ‘breaking in’ and ‘taking our IP,’ and ‘it has to stop.’ Well, how do you intend to stop it? What about people who want to give ours away? Well, what do you know. Morgan Phillips (Fox News): DeepSeek fallout: GOP Sen Josh Hawley seeks to cut off all US-China collaboration on AI development This week the U.S. tech sector was routed by the Chinese launch of DeepSeek, and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is putting forth legislation to prevent that from happening again. Hawley’s bill, the Decoupling America’s Artifical Intelligence Capabilities from China Act, would cut off U.S.-China cooperation on AI. It would ban exports or imports of AI technology from China, ban American companies from conducting research there, and prohibit any U.S. investment in AI tech companies in China. “Every dollar and gig of data that flows into Chinese AI are dollars and data that will ultimately be used against the United States,” said Hawley in a statement. “America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary.” Jingoism is so hot right now. It’s a problem. No, every dollar that flows into China will not ‘be used against the United States’ and seriously what the actual f*** are you doing, once again, trying to ban both imports and exports? How are both of these things a problem? In any case, I know what Microsoft is going to do about all this. Shanghai Panda: Microsoft yesterday: DeepSeek illegally stole OpenAI’s intellectual property. Microsoft today: DeepSeek is now available on our AI platforms and welcome everyone trying it. Burny: The duality of man. Microsoft knows what Hawley doesn’t, which in this case is to never interrupt the enemy while he is making a mistake. If DeepSeek wants to then give their results back to us for free, and it’s a good model, who are we to say no? What other implications are there here? Robin Hanson, never stop Robin Hansoning, AI skepticism subversion. Robin Hanson: For folks worried about AI, this seems good news – leaders can’t get much ahead of the pack, & big spillover effects should discourage investment. Miles Kruppa (WSJ): Why ‘Distillation’ Has Become the Scariest Word for AI Companies. ”It’s sort of like if you got a couple of hours to interview Einstein and you walk out being almost as knowledgeable as him in physics,” said Ali Ghodsi, chief executive officer of data management company Databricks. Want some bad news for future AI capabilities? I’ve got just the thing for you. The WSJ article seems to buy into r1-as-distillation. Certainly r1 is a ‘fast follow’ and copies the example of o1, but v3 was the impressive result and definitely not distillation at all, and to primarily call r1 a distillation seems very wrong. r1 does allow you distill r1 into other smaller things (see ‘v3 implies r1’) or bootstrap into larger things too, and also they told everyone how to do it, but they chose that path. Also DeepSeek suddenly has a very valuable market position if they were to dare to try and use it, exactly because they spent a lot of money to get there first. The fact that others can copy r1 only partly takes that away, and it would be a much smaller part if they hadn’t gone as open as they did (although being open in this case helped create the opportunity). Similarly, Berkeley’s replication distilled a different open model. ChatGPT has retained dominant market share, at least until now, for reasons that have little to do with technical superiority. It is crazy how easy it is for people to go all Missile Gap, and claim we are ‘losing to China.’ Which, I suppose, means that in a key way we are indeed losing to China. We are letting them drive this narrative that they are winning, that the future belongs to them. Which, when so many people now believe in Rule By Vibes, means they have the vibes, and then here we are. That phenomenon is of course centered this week on AI, but it goes well beyond AI. Et tu, Tyler Cowen, citing ‘the popularity of apps like TikTok, RedNote and DeepSeek.’ I mean, ‘how did America’s internet become so cool? The popularity of apps like Google, Amazon, Instagram and Netflix’ is not a sentence anyone would ever utter these days. If China had America’s apps and America had China’s apps, can you imagine? Or the same for any number of other things. RedNote is effectively also TikTok, so Tyler is citing two examples. Yes, TikTok cracked the addiction algorithm, and China is now using that for propaganda and general sabotage, espionage and shenanigans purposes, and managed to ‘convince’ Trump for now not to ban it, and people were so desperate for their heroin fix some turned to RedNote as ‘refugees.’ Tyler notes he doesn’t use TikTok much. I find it completely worthless and unusable, but even in so doing I do think I kind of understand, somewhat, the kind of addictive haze that it invokes, that pull of spinning the roulette wheel one more time. I’ve watched people briefly use it when we’re both on trains, and yeah I’m Being That Guy but wow did it seem braindead, worthless and toxic AF. Even if they did find videos worth watching for you, given how people scroll, how would you even know? And how about ‘China seems cool’ being due primarily to… vibes out of TikTok, with the algorithm that is in large part designed to do that? It’s like when you periodically see a TikTok where some American youth sobs about how hard her life is and how it’s so much better in China, in various ways that are… documented as all being far worse in China. You are being played. My main exposure to TikTok is through the comedy show After Midnight. On Tuesday evening, they had an intro that was entirely about DeepSeek, painting exactly (mostly through TikTok) effectively a Chinese propaganda story about how DeepSeek manifested r1 out of thin air for $6 million without any other work, whereas OpenAI and American companies spent billions, and how much better DeepSeek is, and so on. And then host Taylor Tomlinson responded to some of the audience with ‘oh, you’re cheering now? Interesting.’ Part of the joke was that Taylor has no idea how AI works and has never used even ChatGPT, and the routine was funny (including, effectively, a joke about how no one cares if Nvidia stock is down 17%, which is completely fair, why should they, also by the taping it was only down 8%), but the streams crossed, I saw America directly being exposed to even worse takes than I’m used to straight from TikTok’s algorithm when I was supposed to be relaxing at the end of the day, and I really didn’t like it. Then again, I do bow to one clear way in which China did outperform us. Ethan Mollick: People don’t talk enough about a giant DeepSeek achievement over most US models – it actually has a reasonable name. Scott: Well, yes and no, the model is named r1…. Ethan Mollick: Thats fine as long as the next is r2 If they release anything called r1.5, I swear to God. Sarah (Yuan Yuan Sun Sara from China) suggests perhaps DeepSeek could get into doing AI safety research, maybe even ask for a grant? Certainly there’s great talent there, and I’d love if they focused on those styles of problem. There’d likely be severe corporate culture issues to get through given what they’ve previously worked on, but it’s worth a shot. Stephen McAleer: I’m hopeful we will figure out how to control superintelligence! Fouad: you at the office? could use some code review on superintelligence_control.py before i merge Stephen McAleer: It can surely wait until Monday. I increasingly worry about the pattern of OpenAI safety researchers thinking about how to ‘control’ superintelligence rather than align it, and how this relates to the techniques they’re currently using including deliberative alignment. (Note: I still owe that post on Deliberative Alignment, coming soon.) Are reasoning models including r1 a blackpill for robotics progress? Kyle Stachowicz: R1’s RL findings are great news for reasoning but grim for robotics. All the major takeaways (ground-truth reward, great base models, grouped rollouts from same initial state, sample-inefficient on-policy algos) are really hard to translate to the physical world. Chris Paxton: Hot deepseek take: before r1 blew up, a ton of western AI (and robotics!) efforts — startups, big companies, and even academic labs — were basically just waiting for openai to solve all their problems and it was honestly kind of sad. I hope r1 changed that Scott Reed: True. A lot of groups gave up prematurely, or allocate ~all resources to one giant model. This leads people to spend more effort on winner-take-all gpu politics and less on just training the best models they can with moderate resources. If anyone wondered what happened to Gato2, gpu game of thrones is (at least partly) what. An interesting counterfactual was the Genie project, which was stubbornly cobbled together mainly out of pooled user quota. This kind of stubborn independence can lead to cool results! “Um This scaling law model I made says [the world will end / company will die] if you dont give me all the GPUs and block any other team from pretraining” “No, f*** you, I will train my own model” Yes and no, right? It’s going to be relatively hard, but seems super doable to me, I know those in the field will say that’s naive but I don’t see it. The real physical world absolutely 100% has ground truth in it. If you want to train on an accurate reward signal, there’s various trickiness, but there are plenty of things we should be able to measure. Also, with time we should get increasingly strong physics simulations that provide increasingly strong synthetic data for robotics, or simply have so much funding that we can generate physical samples anyway? We’re sample-inefficient relative to a human but you can train a decent reasoning model on 17k data points, and presumably you could bootstrap from there, and so on. I am not going to quote or name particular people directly on this at this time. But as Obama often said, let me be clear. Reasonable people can disagree about: However. The existence of DeepSeek, and its explicit advocacy of open weights AGI, and potentially having it be the best model out there in the future in many people’s imginations, has been a forcing function. Suddenly, people who previously stuck to ‘well obviously your restrictions are too much’ without clarifying where their line was, are revealing that they have no line. And many more people than before are revealing that they prefer any or all of: These people are often saying, rather explicitly, that they will use whatever powers they have at their disposal, to ensure that humanity gets to a position that, if you think about it for a minute or five, humanity probably cannot survive. And that they will oppose, on principle, any ability to steer the future, because they explicitly oppose the ability to steer the future, except when they want to steer the future into a state that cannot then be steered by humans. No, I have not heard actual arguments for why or how you can put an aligned-only-to-user AGI into everyone’s desktop or whatever, with no mechanism of collective control over that whatsoever, and have this end well for the humans. What that future would even look like. Nor have I heard any argument for why the national security states of the world, or the people of the world, would ever allow this. The mask on those is fully off. These people don’t bother offering arguments on any of that. They just say say, essentially, ‘f*** you safetyists,’ ‘f*** you big tech,’ ‘f*** you United States,’ and often effectively ‘f*** you rest of humanity.’ They are the xenocide caucus, advocating for things that cause human extinction to own the in-context-libs. If that is you: I thank you for your candor. Please speak directly into this microphone. I disagree in the strongest possible terms. As always, be excellent to each other, and all that. A large part of this job I’ve assigned to myself is to do a f***ton of emotional labor. You have people who are constantly telling you that you’re a cartoon villain because you think that the United States government might want to know if someone trains a frontier model, or that you might think releasing a literal AGI’s weights would be unwise, or that we shouldn’t let China get our best GPUs. You get called statist and totalitarian for positions that are 95th to 99th percentile libertarian. You get outright lies, all the time, from all directions. Much from people trying to incept the vibes they want. And so on. And the same stuff to varying degrees coming from other directions, too. Honestly I’m kind of used to it. Up to a point. You get somewhat numb, you build up some immunity, especially when the same sources do it over and over. I accept it. And even with that, you have to patiently read all of it and respond to the arguments and also try to extract what wisdom might be there from the same sources that are filled with the toxoplasma of rage and trying their best to infect me and others like me as well. But it’s been a trying time. I see a world determined to try and go down many of the craziest, most suicidal paths simultaneously, where I’m surrounded by equal and opposite bad takes in many dimensions. Where the odds are against us and the situation is grim. In ways that I and others warned about explicitly, including the exact ways and dynamics by which we reached this point. Make no mistake. Humanity is losing. Meanwhile, on top of all the Being Wrong on the Internet, the toxoplasma is as bad as it has ever been, with certain sources going so far as to in large part blame not only worried people in general but also me specifically by name for our current situation – and at least one of those people I feel compelled to continue to listen to because they also have unique insights in other ways and I’m sometimes told I have a blind spot there – which I actually rarely hear about other credible sources. And I still try. But I’m only human and it’s just so damn hard at this point. Especially when they rage about things I said that turned out to be true, and true for exactly the reasons I said they’d be true, but I know trying to point this out wouldn’t do any good. I don’t know what my solution here is going to be. I do know that things can’t go on like this, I know life isn’t fair and reality doesn’t grade on a curve and someone has to and no one else will but also I only have so much in the tank that handles these things. And I’m going to have to budget that tank, but I want to be clear that I’m going to be doing that, and dropping certainly sources for this reason that I would otherwise have included for completeness. If this was talking about you, and you’d like to continue this trip, please get it together. Don’t worry, your argument remains valid. I mean, it’s wrong, but that never stopped you before, why start now? Time comes for us all. Matt: Live players in who kills us first? Peter Wildeford: Yes, that’s one way to look at it. I believe that opensource advancements like R1 will drive wider adoption of ai systems. I think that the pricing models will change soon. Everyone talks about cost per million tokens to contact a hosted service, but I think it'll switch to be cloud costs to provide infrastructure that can run models. Virtual machines running something like ollama. This solves another huge problem, privacy and how prompt data is handled. If you're using an api to a hosted service you need to have a very good understanding of how your submitted prompt data is handled. This is key for organisations. I feel like the lack of understanding here is preventing widespread adoption, especially for communication tools that handle sensitive data. For example, you could run Deepseek R1 using ollama on an Azure virtual machine (nc series) that you pay per hour for, and then your cost isn't based on usage of your ai. Right now it's expensive to provision the infra to support decent models, but these costs fall continuously. I can imagine a world where organisations provision cloud infrastructure in their environments running open source models. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nc-series?tabs=sizebasic https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 Is there any other consumer software that works on this model? I can't think of any Some enterprise software has stuff like this A very detailed and technical analysis of the bear case for Nvidia by Jeffrey Emanuel, that Matt Levine claims may have been responsible for the Nvidia price decline. I read that last week. It was an interesting case of experiencing Gell-Mann-Amnesia several times within the same article. All the parts where I have some expertise were vague, used terminology incorrectly and were often just wrong. All the rest was very interesting! If this article crashed the market: EMH RIP. I would hesitate to buy a build based on R1. R1 is special in the sense that the MoE-architecture trades off compute requirements vs RAM requirements. Which is why now these CPU-builds start to make some sense - you get a lot less compute, but much more RAM. As soon as the next dense model drops which could have 5-times fewer parameters for the same performance the build will stop making any sense. And of course until then you are also handicapped when it comes to running smaller models fast. The sweet spot is integrated RAM/VRAM like in a Mac and in the upcoming NVIDIA DIGITS. But buying a handful of used 3090s probably also makes more sense to me then the CPU-only builds. New benchmark agrees with my intuitions on r1's creative writing skills: https://x.com/LechMazur/status/1885430117591027712

Apple's earnings report shows why I always say "own it, don't trade it." Where it has launched Apple Intelligence, the iPhone 16 sells better. High-margin services revenues was better. Mac better. Accessories better. Europe better. India better. Expanding gross margins helped make the numbers, too. Shares are up about 4% Friday. 2. China is still a question mark for Apple, though. Revenues down 11% there in the quarter. Apple Intelligence still needs government approval to launch. Rivals Huawei and Xiaomi can access the AI from buzzy Chinese startup DeepSeek. What can Apple get to reverse its fortunes in China? Will Baidu be its AI partner? 3. The U.S. government is looking into whether DeepSeek used third-parties in Singapore to acquire Nvidia chips that Washington has banned in China, according to Bloomberg News. Club name Nvidia says it plays by the rules in Singapore, and that its revenue from the island country does not indicate diversion. 4. We know Tesla, Club stock Meta and Oracle want all the high-end Nvidia chips they can get, even with DeepSeek's emergence. We don't know about Club names Alphabet or Amazon, which both report next week. What if one of the two says we are reassessing our orders for Nvidia's next-gen AI platform Blackwell? What happens to the stock? What if Amazon, another Club holding, says it's leaning into using AMD? I made a call on Nvidia stock for Club members yesterday. 5. Geopolitics remain part of the Nvidia dilemma. Does DeepSeek have a juicer that can make 10 glasses of orange juice out of a single orange, or does it have 10 government-subsidized juicers that it just won't tell us about? If it is 10 juicers, I worry that President Donald Trump will just ban all semiconductor exports to China. 6. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, currently set to take effect Saturday, may exclude oil, the president told reporters Thursday night. U.S. oil benchmark WTI was slightly higher Friday, to roughly $73 barrel. The U.S. dollar index strengthened, but it's still below its recent highs set earlier this month. 7. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average were all set to open higher Friday. Stock futures held onto their gains after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge matched expectations for December. The PCE index rose 0.3% month over month and, when excluding food and energy, 2.8% on an annual basis. 8. Intel showed some cost discipline and improved cash flow in its quarterly results. But the fourth quarter is typically strong for them, and there might have been some pull-through ahead of higher tariffs on Chinese imports. The PC market is weak. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo cut their price targets on the struggling chip stock. Shares added more than 1% Friday. 9. Atlassian shares jumped almost 20% on the back of a very good quarter. The company, which trades under the ticker TEAM, makes pure enterprise software that makes it easier to share and simplify. Seems unstoppable. 10. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' non-opioid painkiller Journavx, which blocks pain signals sent to the brain at their origin. This drug could be a blockbuster, and it's been on my radar for a while now. Vertex shares climbed about 3% Friday. Sign up for my Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Do you have newsworthy information to share? Send tips to The Atlantic at tips@proton.theatlantic.com. The Chinese app has already hit the chipmaker giant Nvidia’s share price, but its true potential could upend the whole AI business model. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Only rarely does a single company’s new product provoke a major market sell-off. But that’s exactly what happened on Monday, when a large language model from a Chinese company named DeepSeek drove the entire Nasdaq index of tech companies down more than 3 percent and shaved more than 17 percent off the market capitalization of the chipmaker Nvidia—which, until that moment, had been the most valuable company in the world. The panicked selling of Nvidia had a surface logic. The company provides almost all of the computer chips (called GPUs) that companies such as Alphabet, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta rely on to train their LLMs. (The Atlantic entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI in 2024.) Consequently, it has been the biggest beneficiary of the huge boom in corporate spending on AI that we’ve seen over the past few years. (Nvidia’s annual revenue has quadrupled since 2022.) Although DeepSeek also used Nvidia chips to train its model, the company said that they were an older type of GPU—U.S. export controls imposed by the Biden administration have prevented Chinese companies from buying cutting-edge chips. DeepSeek’s disclosure raises the possibility that future progress in training LLMs could be made with fewer, simpler chips, and at a lower cost than previously anticipated. That would obviously put a big dent in Nvidia’s profits. So investors dumped its stock. Read: The DeepSeek wake-up call If investors are very concerned about how DeepSeek might hurt chipmakers, they seem surprisingly unconcerned about how it might affect big AI software companies. Meta’s stock price, for instance, actually rose on Monday, and although the stocks of Alphabet and Microsoft did take a hit, they bounced back over the next couple of days. Some of that is because the underlying business of these companies, independent of AI, remains enormously profitable. But it also suggests that investors aren’t paying enough attention to the way DeepSeek’s success could disrupt the AI market, and in doing so threaten the future profits of the tech companies that are currently spending many billions of dollars every year on their LLMs. Tech investors have historically profited by spotting the new new thing. But at the moment, they seem implicitly to assume that all of the fundamental change in the LLM business has already happened and that its future will look much like its present, with the companies that currently dominate the space—many of which are not simply competitors but also financial partners—continuing to do so indefinitely. What happened over the past week is a reminder that these assumptions may not be so solid. The large language model that caused such a stir on Monday, DeepSeek-R1, is clearly comparable with LLMs such as ChatGPT o1-mini and Claude 3.5. Measured by industry benchmarks that rate subject knowledge, reasoning, and accuracy, the DeepSeek model seems to deliver similar performance while costing much less to develop—though just how much less remains a matter of debate. Beyond dispute is that it’s cheaper to use: Consumers can get access to DeepSeek’s core functions for free, and third-party developers are being charged a fraction of the cost of a product such as ChatGPT. DeepSeek also uses open-source technology, meaning that, in theory, you could download the program and run your own AI on your desktop if you had a powerful-enough computer. The fact that the LLM offers reasonable performance—results that, even a year ago, would have seemed startlingly good—at a significantly lower cost means that it has to be taken seriously as a competitor. From one angle, in fact, DeepSeek looks like what the business-school professor Clayton Christensen, in his book The Innovator’s Dilemma, dubbed a “disruptive technology”: a product that’s less powerful than the products at the top of the market but also much cheaper, and that has the possibility of improving in quality over time to the point where it offers a superior combination of price and performance for most customers. In this regard, the rapid uptake of DeepSeek by users around the world has been striking. The LLM still has miles to go in market share to catch ChatGPT, which has more than 300 million weekly users, but since its release on January 20, its mobile-app version has been downloaded more than 3 million times from Google Play and Apple, making it the most popular app on both stores. That suggests that the cost of switching from one AI tool to another is very low, and that the moats big AI companies are building around their business may be much shallower than they’d hoped. Read: China’s DeepSeek surprise The underlying wager that these companies have made is that the big money they’re investing will result in radically better performance, which in turn will enable them to charge hefty sums to businesses and, to a lesser extent, consumers. (OpenAI, for instance, is reportedly targeting $100 billion in revenue by 2029.) And these companies remain committed to that bet. This week, the CEOs of both Microsoft and Meta said that enormous spending is essential to staying competitive in the market. Dario Amodei, a co-founder and the CEO of Anthropic (in which both Amazon and Google have invested heavily), wrote in a blog post that companies are going to continue to “spend more and more on training powerful AI models, even as … the cost of training a given level of model intelligence declines rapidly,” because “the economic value of training more and more intelligent models is so great.” In the long run, such investment may well result in the kind of performance improvement that a company like DeepSeek (which can’t even get access to the most powerful GPUs)—or the many other low-cost LLM developers that are sure to try to emulate it—cannot keep up with. When you look at ordinary users’ embrace of DeepSeek, though, you can also see an alternative future. In this one, AI performance improves so much that most customers are happy with cheap, good-enough LLMs, and AI models end up as essentially interchangeable, commoditized products, with the small profits that always follow that type of commercial diffusion. We’re going to find out whether the great authors of the disruptive technology that’s transforming the business world might themselves get disrupted.

Title: Streamer Dr Disrespect's YouTube income ban lifted after scandal

Controversial gaming streamer Herschel 'Guy' Beahm, known online as Dr Disrespect, has said he is able to start making money from YouTube again after being dropped in 2024. His announcement came on the same day as the gaming studio he co-founded said it was "closing its doors after three incredible years". Developer Midnight Society, which was working on shooter game Deadrop, cut ties with the YouTuber last year after becoming aware of "an allegation" against him. Beahm denied any wrongdoing, but admitted sending messages to "an individual minor" in 2017, insisting "nothing illegal happened". The content creator has 4.5 million subscribers on the platform and was dropped by various sponsors but declared on his stream on Thursday that "we've got our YouTube monetisation back". In a statement to BBC Newsbeat, YouTube said it had "reinstated" Dr Disrespect to its partner program "after careful review of the channel's recent activity". "Dr Disrespect was previously suspended... for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action," it added. The Dr Disrespect character gained popularity for his chaotic style of play and aggressive - at times rude - commentary. Last year, Midnight Society terminated Beahm's role at the company, four years after he was abruptly kicked off streaming platform Twitch, where he had a big following. In 2022, Beahm and Twitch agreed a settlement, where neither party admitted any wrongdoing. The reason for his removal then was never made clear - with the Amazon-owned platform only saying it acted whenever users broke the rules. Last June, a former Twitch employee said the removal was linked to messages sent to a minor. Beahm responded: "Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me." He did though apologise to his "community and colleagues" for his actions. "That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father... it should have never happened", he wrote on social media. He was suspended from YouTube's partner program and retreated from streaming until September. In November he signed a deal with video platform Rumble to head its gaming division. The closure of Midnight Society comes amid wider struggles in the games industry, with Ubisoft and Bioware among notable companies already announcing cuts in 2025. Midnight Society previously announced layoffs in September 2024 but said it remained committed to releasing the game this year. In its statement announcing its closure, the company apologised for being "unable to reach our ultimate goal" of making Deadrop. The game got its start through the sale of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) - "one-of-a-kind" digital assets that experience an intial boom before vastly dropping in value. Some who invested have asked the company if they will be receiving refunds. BBC Newsbeat has requested comment from Midnight Society but not heard back. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. It is the first study to look at school phone rules, alongside measures of pupil health and education. The star who played Meta's Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network slams his plan to ditch fact-checkers. Following a TikTok ban in the US, phones and iPads with the TikTok app preinstalled are up for sale. Experts say it's a security disaster waiting to happen. Many companies have left X but it's not always a simple decision. The US government says Chinese apps and online activities threaten Americans' security. But US internet users can't get enough of Chinese memes. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Title: M.M., Tempi, and the fainthearted, rumors of an acquisition by Piraeus bank, DEI and the Norwegians, and the… progressive lobbies of the stock market

Time Published: 2025-01-31T09:39:22Z
Full Content:
Tempi and Government Stress Levels Hello, the Tempi case continues to dominate public interest while also creating an extremely stressful situation within the government’s ranks, to the point where, dare I say, most of them are on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Not all of them, of course—there are also the level-headed ones who view Mitsotakis’ public appearance as a “necessary move for partial de-escalation and as proof to the public that the Prime Minister is listening, taking responsibility, and trying to solve problems, even assuming full accountability.” However, this is merely the calm assessment of some officials. There’s also the classic “fainthearted” reaction: “We’re doomed! The reports, the Preliminary Investigations, the trials are coming, and we’ll be entangled in this mess indefinitely.” Now, let me tell you what I know from my sources: First, the NTUA report, according to my information, will be ambiguous—it will state that the fireball was not caused by the lubricants used in the train’s engine, but at the same time, it will not confirm the presence of any flammable material. A report by a Belgian expert is expected to lean slightly more towards the existence of some quantity of flammable substance, but there are also reports suggesting otherwise. The government’s response to all this will be the obvious one: “Let everything go to the judiciary and let them draw the appropriate conclusions.” Second, regarding whether there will be a Preliminary Investigation Committee, the answer from an official source is crystal clear: “We’ve said dozens of times that if the Prosecutor’s indictment includes political figures, the government will facilitate the process and accept the establishment of a Preliminary Investigation Committee. But only if the judiciary requests it—not based on lawsuits filed by the victims’ families.” Third, the Tempi trial has been expected since day one. The government, through Floridis, even amended the law to expedite it, unlike the Mati trial, which took six years to begin. These are the facts, and this is the government’s approach. Where responsibility remains unclear is in what has been done from the time of the accident until now to allow the state to credibly say: “Here are the measures we’ve taken to drastically reduce the chances of this tragedy happening again.” Because, let’s not forget, accidents will always happen—whether in Washington, at the heart of the most technologically advanced transport system, or anywhere else. Also, a legal expert told me that the infamous case of backfilling (of the tracks) constitutes only a misdemeanor. As soon as K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) made statements about the Investigation Committee, former members of such committees turned pale. Many prominent figures involved avoided answering phone calls, something the government picked up on and decided to do some political “massaging.” The message from the government was that the Prime Minister’s position was a general one—this is his standard stance on Investigation Committees, which rarely produce clear conclusions. Therefore, the judiciary should be the one to provide the answers. I’m not sure if this improved anyone’s morale, but such is politics. February will be a long and rough month for the government, with various reports and inquiries on the way. Now, in M.M. (Maximos Mansion, the Greek Prime Minister’s office), they are not politically naive. They were not surprised by Androulakis’ intention to file a no-confidence motion against the government. The timing, of course, is the crucial factor. It’s clear that Androulakis is waiting for both the NTUA report and the report from EODASAAM (due on February 27) before making his move—coinciding with the second anniversary of the Tempi disaster. Obviously, he aims to align with public sentiment—thousands protesting in the streets while the government faces pressure in Parliament. Notably, this will be the second no-confidence motion filed by PASOK within a year. And to be fair, Androulakis is simply doing his job. Today’s Cabinet meeting, of course, is overshadowed by the Tempi case and the announcement of the no-confidence motion, but there are serious issues on the agenda. One of them is the Ministry of Education’s initiative to hire 600 priests over the next three years for the Greek-speaking Patriarchates. This has been a long-standing request of Patriarch Bartholomew, and Pierrakakis intends to grant it. It’s also a move with geopolitical significance, as Greece seeks to expand its soft power in the region, strengthening its influence through its Christian heritage. Now, let’s turn to market news, where all eyes are on a major move being prepared (intensely) by H. Megalou. But with acquisitions, you never really know—things usually turn out differently from what the market senses. Sources indicate that within the next two or three days, it will become clear whether Piraeus Bank’s plan will materialize. The very few details available suggest an acquisition, and not just any acquisition—a large-scale one. So, the “usual suspects” are ruled out. One rumor that surfaced on Dark Room’s radar—and let me stress, this is just a RUMOR, NOT VERIFIED INFORMATION—is that H. Megalou’s big move is towards acquiring Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance). Given that acquisitions often turn out different from market expectations, this scenario could be plausible. But it’s not simple or easy—National Insurance’s bancassurance agreement is with National Bank of Greece, and I don’t know what penalties or clauses that contract might include. However, if this deal is indeed in the works, I assume they have found a way around it. Strategically, it would make sense, as the ECB’s rapid interest rate cuts are pushing banks to seek acquisitions in sectors with high commission revenues. I don’t know the details, but it seems that market rumors about a small lobby that has grabbed Proodeftiki’s stock and sent it skyrocketing are not unfounded. The stock has closed higher for five consecutive sessions. From €0.28, it has surged to €0.376 (+34%). In two of those five sessions, it gained over 9%, and yesterday it closed up 5.6%. Proodeftiki used to be a construction company—now, I have no idea what they do (some say real estate), but for all I know, they might as well be in aerospace. Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence have a uniquely Greek angle. A startup called AI-Employee has been operating in Greece and launched a soft rollout 10 days ago. What do they do? They “rent out” AI executives to large corporations. These specialized employees enter companies with their own hardware and localized AI models. In fact, as founder John Doxaras announced on LinkedIn, AI-Employee “sold out” in record time, managing to place ALL of its available AI professionals. These AI-powered employees come equipped with AI agents, work within organizations to solve problems on the spot, develop new applications and solutions, and provide extensive training on AI prompting. Despite being just two weeks old, the Greek startup has already attracted clients from the banking sector, telecommunications, and even government agencies. Now, let’s head to Paris, specifically to the Palais-Royal area, where the Greek Roadshow by Piraeus Securities took place at Espace Clery. The event featured Greece’s top publicly traded companies, and French fund managers showed intense interest, with 150 meetings held with 30 different funds—compared to last year’s 116 meetings with 24 funds. As an investor relations executive from a participating company explained, the French investment market is challenging due to its broad spectrum of investors. Some funds are highly targeted and long-term, seeing opportunities in Greece, while others, as one analyst put it, are starting “from scratch” with no real knowledge of the Greek market. However, what stood out to many IR professionals and executives was the sense of instability surrounding France’s economic and political outlook, a concern that surfaced repeatedly in discussions. Regarding Greek assets, the French highlighted clear advantages, such as Greece’s regained investment-grade rating, its comparatively strong economic growth within the EU, and high dividend yields. PPC (Public Power Corporation) is charging toward a €5 billion market cap, with its stock price at €13.27—an 11-year high. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the Norges Fund, known as the ultimate “long-only fund,” consistently invests in “green” projects and has officially acquired a 0.14% stake in PPC, though market whispers suggest its actual holding is higher. Over the past three months, 23.5 million PPC shares have changed hands, with the stock price rising more than 10.6%. This surge in activity has fueled fresh speculation about PPC’s next big deal, one that CEO Giorgos Stassis is rumored to be working on—though lately, he’s been keeping a low profile. The stock of Viohalco, the parent company of the Viohalco Group, has gained roughly 14% over the past month, reaching €6.10. Its market capitalization now exceeds €1.58 billion, while its 72%-owned subsidiary, Cenergy, has surpassed €2 billion (€9.60 per share, up 2.24% yesterday). This means that all the other subsidiaries within the group—ElvalHalcor, Noval Property, etc.—are currently valued at essentially zero, despite the fact that the group as a whole contributes 8% of Greece’s GDP. Unless the sky falls on our heads today, the General Index will log its fourth consecutive positive week of 2025 and its sixth straight week of gains since mid-December 2024. The index hasn’t closed above 1,550.72 points (+0.3%) since way back on April 7, 2011. However, with trading volume at €108.9 million (of which €8.2 million came from block trades), the rally isn’t exactly convincing. In fact, buyers were largely absent for most of yesterday’s session, only showing up after 4 PM to keep heavyweight stocks in positive territory. Coca-Cola, Eurobank, and Motor Oil propped up the index, while other blue-chip stocks simply managed to shake off their earlier losses and stabilize. Not one, not two, but a whopping 35-minute delay (!) in announcing its earnings sent Mark Zuckerberg’s META (who, by the way, is house-hunting in Washington to be as close as possible to Trump) into a tailspin, causing a mini-meltdown on Wall Street. In that half-hour, META’s stock price swung wildly up and down based on AI-related rumors. In the end, META beat analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings per share ($8.02/share), bringing in $48.4 billion in revenue. Microsoft’s stock went through a similar ordeal—it posted stronger-than-expected profits but weak cloud revenue, and in this new AI-driven market, everything counts. Amid all this digital economy turbulence, one thing that truly shines is gold, which hit a new all-time high of $2,840 per ounce, marking a staggering 40% gain over the past 12 months. “If the Fed had spent less time on DEI—the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategy—gender ideology, ‘green’ energy, and the fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in our country’s history.” The term of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ends in 15 months, in May 2026. President Trump’s war against the Fed began on day one of his presidency. His view is that by increasing oil supply (“drill baby drill”), he will lower energy prices and, in turn, reduce inflation, leading to lower interest rates. Since January 20, crude oil and natural gas prices have dropped by more than 10%. Energy affects the Consumer Price Index by approximately 8%. However, energy costs also influence food prices and other services. Since Trump’s reelection in November, U.S. gasoline prices have dropped to $3.08 per gallon, close to the lowest level since 2021. Consequently: A $10 decrease in oil prices would reduce U.S. inflation by 0.2%. If oil prices fall to around $50, inflation could drop by nearly half a percentage point. However, the Fed’s priority is not just price stability—it also includes employment and economic stability. Some Federal Reserve Board members are Republicans (such as the St. Louis Fed banker), but they do not share Trump’s urgency to cut interest rates on the dollar, as the large public debt forces the Fed to borrow at high costs. The Trump-Powell war is only in its first phase. The German government announced the day before yesterday that economic growth in 2025 will barely exceed +0.3%, despite initial forecasts of +1.6%, later revised to +1.1%, and ultimately proven wrong. Yesterday, it was officially confirmed that in the fourth quarter of the year, Germany’s economic growth rate was negative (-0.2%), even worse than the initial estimates (-0.1%). Key economic indicators, such as the Ifo Business Climate Index or incoming orders, provide little reason for optimism. The elections in Germany are taking place in an atmosphere of general uncertainty, and we all know where that leads. Explore related questions

Title: Five market signals flashing red amid DeepSeek sell-off

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. LONDON (Reuters) - In a week when AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) suffered the biggest one-day loss of value on record and the Federal Reserve said it was in no hurry to cut rates again, a few gauges underscore markets' vulnerability to big swings. Investors and analysts said the sell-off in tech stocks this week, driven by the popularity of China's DeepSeek AI model, highlights the market ructions that can occur when heavy speculation meets unexpected bad news. Here are five signals that highlight some of the tensions simmering. Despite Monday's ructions investors remain bullish about U.S. tech and President Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation, heightening risks of market gyrations if this widespread consensus proves wrong. Short-term speculators have in recent months taken on more debt to magnify their gains, with levels of so-called gross leverage among hedge funds that trade U.S. stocks hitting their highest since 2010 in January, Morgan Stanley data showed. Citi's equity positioning model, derived from futures contracts, shows traders are heavily betting on further gains for Wall Street's tech-focused Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). "Everyone is sort of piled in. They're super optimistic," GAM chief multi-asset strategist Julian Howard said. These trends are making some long-term money managers nervous, with JPMorgan attributing part of Nvidia's violent Jan. 27 drop to traditional asset managers selling out. Kevin Thozet, investment committee member at Carmignac, said he had reduced exposure to U.S. tech stocks several days ago and added to positions that would profit if the Nasdaq fell, saying DeepSeek called U.S. tech-stock "exceptionalism" into question. High-for-longer U.S. interest rates, he added, might prompt U.S. households, now heavily invested in stocks, to pull money out. Analysis by the U.S. Office of Financial Research has also found strong correlations between retail investment in speculative assets, such as crypto-currencies and use of consumer credit, signaling last year's rate cuts fueled market gains. The highest bond yields in years could also dent stocks' appeal as investors can now get returns of 4% or more on government debt. One measure of the equity risk premium - the extra return investors can expect for stocks - dropped below zero in December for the first time since the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in 2002. "When people talk about managing volatility amidst all this, one of the areas which does it really well is short-dated fixed income," said GAM's Howard. Since the Nov. 5 U.S. election, traders have doubled the size of their bets that the dollar (DX=F) will rise. They now hold net short positions - a bet on the value of something falling - in all other major currencies. This has only happened on rare occasions in the last 10 years, LSEG data shows. Much of this positioning is predicated on the Fed cutting rates more slowly than elsewhere, and an assumption that tariffs and tax cuts spark higher inflation and government borrowing, meaning any change to that scenario could be problematic for the U.S. currency. High concentration in tech stocks has made portfolios vulnerable, analysts say, and a rush to alternatives, such as Japan's yen (JPY=X) and European credit, is another sign of fast-changing market dynamics. As European shares have hit record highs, Bank of America data showed money has flowed into European credit funds for 23 consecutive weeks. The VIX (^VIX), which measures how volatile traders expect the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to become, is below its long-run average of about 20. But it has spiked out of nowhere twice in the last six months, once in August when a surge in the yen wreaked global havoc and again in December when the Fed hinted it would slow the pace of rate cuts. Rob Almeida, global investment strategist and portfolio Manager at MFS International, described markets as "fragile" and said Monday's heavy stock selling may have been driven by "leverage that might be being unwound and isn't being accounted for".

Title: Chinese state-linked accounts hyped DeepSeek AI launch ahead of US stock rout, Graphika says

For premium support please call: For premium support please call: By Katie Paul and Stephen Nellis NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese state-linked social media accounts amplified narratives celebrating the launch of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI models last week, days before the news tanked U.S. tech stocks, according to online analysis firm Graphika. The accounts involved in the effort, including those of Chinese diplomats, embassies and state media, amplified media coverage of the launch and promoted the idea that DeepSeek challenged U.S. dominance in the AI sector, New York-based Graphika said in a report it provided to Reuters on Thursday. The messaging was rolled out on platforms such as Elon Musk's X and Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, as well as Chinese services Toutiao and Weibo, Graphika said. "This activity shows how China is able to quickly mobilize a range of actors that seed and amplify online narratives casting Beijing as surpassing the U.S. in critical areas of geopolitical competition, including the race to develop and deploy the most advanced AI technologies," Graphika Chief Intelligence Officer Jack Stubbs told Reuters. "We've consistently seen overt and covert Chinese state-linked actors among the first movers in leveraging AI to scale their operations in the information environment." Graphika said it also found a video featuring pro-China, anti-Western content on a YouTube channel whose activity resembled that of Shadow Play, a coordinated influence campaign involving at least 30 YouTube channels that was first identified by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in 2023. YouTube owner Alphabet, Meta, X and the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. Graphika said it found a small spike in discussion about DeepSeek's advancements in relation to OpenAI's ChatGPT on X immediately after DeepSeek released its models on Jan. 20, followed by a much larger uptick that started on Friday and continued to build over the weekend. By Monday, DeepSeek's free AI assistant had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's app store and global investors dumped U.S. tech stocks, wiping $593 billion off chipmaker Nvidia's market value in a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street. Nvidia declined to comment on the Graphika report. DeepSeek's researchers claim to have developed aspects of their AI model at a far lower cost than U.S. rivals, sparking worries that U.S. companies that have plowed tens of billions of dollars into AI data centers could face a price war with China. Shares of Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI that operates data centers on behalf of the ChatGPT creator, slid earlier this week when it disclosed slower cloud revenue growth than Wall Street expected while it continued to plow billions into capital expenditures. Microsoft and Meta have vowed to continue deep investments in AI for the foreseeable future. DeepSeek's rise to prominence was celebrated in China as a sign that the nation was beating back Washington's attempts to contain China's tech industry with curbs on technology exports. In the U.S., DeepSeek's accomplishments sparked accusations that it had improperly accessed technology from OpenAI and other leaders, though the allegations remain unproved. The U.S. Commerce Department is looking into whether DeepSeek has been using U.S. chips that are not allowed to be shipped to China, a person familiar with the matter said.
