How Substack, Kajabi, Patreon and more are solving the industry’s sustainability problem Hey Creatorverse readers, A lot of digital ink has been spilled about the money you can make in the creator space. But while social media monetization and brand deals get a lot of love, less is written about highly profitable subscription-based universe of the creator ecosystem. “[Social media platforms] are constantly going to tweak the algorithm to make sure that the way they make money is optimized. But if you’re a creator and you’re used to certain rules of the game and that changes, your business can go upside down overnight,” Ahad Khan, CEO of Kajabi, told me. For a monthly fee, Kajabi allows creators to build assets like digital shops, email newsletters, courses and podcasts. Instead of floating around in YouTube or TikTok’s algorithm hoping the right person clicks on the right link, platforms like Kajabi give creators a way to build a more direct connection to their fans. And the company has emerged as a sustainable option for many creators. Since the company’s launch in 2010, creators have collectively earned $10 billion through Kajabi, according to the company. Overall, 1,800 Kajabi creators have reached millionaire status, more than 70 have crossed the $10 million threshold and at least one has surpassed $100 million. According to Khan, creators only need to make about $8,300 a month in order to build a six-figure business. “It’s a very sustainable way to make a living, if you do it right,” he said. And Kajabi is far from alone when it comes to profitable platforms that directly connect creators to their fans. Here’s what companies are saying about how much creators are making on their platforms: Creators who use platforms like these don’t have to post as often since offering pay-walled content gives them a way to make passive income. Not only does that help eliminate burnout, but it also gives creators more control over their businesses. Entrepreneurs who use these platforms are also much more likely to use social media to promote their paid offerings than rely largely on social monetization. Of course, this isn’t a strategy that works for everyone. The biggest categories under Kajabi’s umbrella are health, fitness, business and finance — topics that have an evergreen quality to them and that people are always anxious to learn more about. But it just shows there is at least some sort of tried-and-true strategy for the 15% of creators who are making over $100,000 a year. Now onto what you may have missed the rest of the week. Kayla CobbSenior Reporterkayla.cobb@thewrap.com P.S. You don’t want to miss a livestream roundtable I’ll be moderating, “Creator Power: The Business of Influence,” at noon PT on Aug. 14. Sign up today here. Clarification: A previous version of this story mistakenly classified Raptive as a subscription based company. It is actually a creator media company with open web creators and has been removed from the list. Regal is hoping Dude Perfect will do for it what Taylor Swift did for AMC The theater chain struck a deal with the five-person duo known for trick shots. Starting in September, the “Dude Perfect: The Hero Tour” documentary will play on more than 800 screens across the U.S., U.K., Western Europe and Australia. The original deal will run for two weeks with an option for extension. Though more creators have been heading to theaters lately (“House of Eden” anyone?), this move is more about Regal trying to fill the 25%-drop-in-ticket-sales hole in its heart. But even for a group that has over 61 million subscribers on YouTube, Dude Perfect probably won’t bring in the crowds Taylor Swift brought to AMC. Amazon’s betting more on creator podcasts, and Nielsen is getting into the podcast tracking game Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is leaving the Amazon-owned podcasting company in the midst of a restructuring move that will impact roughly 110 jobs. Basically, Amazon is folding Wondery’s narrative podcasts into Audible and focusing more on creator-led talk shows like Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” and Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert.” Also this week, Nielsen announced it will be collaborating with Edison Research to launch a podcast dataset as part of the company’s media planning tool. Two big news stories, one big bet on podcasts. WGA is starting to seriously talk about creators ahead of 2026 negotiations As the elections for the WGA West board heat up, YouTube creators are becoming a source of discussion. Board candidate Dahéli Hall said that the guild needs to find a “nuanced way” to protect creators, and incumbent board member Adam Conover agreed that creators were the “future.” It’s still early days,and it’s very possible this idea will be dropped. But the tides, they are a-turnin’. Meta, YouTube and Reddit are up All three companies were winners this quarter, owed in large part to the rise of AI. YouTube’s ad revenue hit almost $10 billion for the quarter, a 13% year-over-year increase. As for Reddit, the influx of AI chatbots worked in the company’s favor, increasing its revenue by 78% to hit just under $500 million in its second quarter — the best growth the company has seen since 2022. But the big winner was Instagram and Facebook’s parent company Meta. The company’s $48 billion revenue caused its shares to jump 11%. Roblox surpasses 100 million daily active users You know who else did well? Roblox. The online game platform averages 111 million daily active users during the quarter — a 41% increase — and secured $1.44 billion in net bookings. Roblox continues to be a massive deal, especially among Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers. In fact, videos related to Roblox have surpassed 1 trillion views on YouTube, an achievement the company celebrated with the YouTube’s Roblox Museum. Snap and Spotify are down You know who didn’t have a great quarter? Snap. After its reported $1.34 billion in revenue missed Wall Street’s expectations, shares for the company dropped 15%. CEO Evan Spiegel blamed a bungled update and Trump’s trading policies for the weak quarter. Spotify also had a hard August with its shares dropping 11% after earnings — the biggest decline the company has ever seen. But fear not. The music streamer’s stock has already bounced back 7% after the announcement of its price hike.

Feeney, a recent Penn State University graduate who has 14 million subscribers across platforms, will be creating daily content for ESPN’s social and digital channels. And considering the NFL’s 10% stake in ESPN, chances are high that coverage is really going to go behind the scenes. A former social media correspondent for the White House and the Washington Commanders, Feeney is used to creating content on the corporate dime.

Quality journalism. Progressive values. Direct to your inbox. U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on July 31, 2025. "Stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers," said one critic. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans' 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that "the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts." The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. "This is the holy grail for private equity," Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump's inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that "there was added desperation from the industry" for access to 401(k)s "because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals." "Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners," they added. "Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential." "Private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that "stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers—and it's being done at the expense of Americans' retirements everywhere." "There's a reason most employers didn't bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign," said Olen. "These funds are high-fee, risky, and opaque. Private equity consistently underperforms the S&P 500. This is a windfall for billionaire fund managers and a disaster in the making for regular Americans trying to save for retirement." Last week, the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and American Federation of Teachers released a report warning that if private equity is given a foothold in 401(k)s, "millions of workers saving for retirement would be exposed to higher risks and steep fees in products that lack basic investor protections and transparency requirements." The report found that private equity profitability "has been in a year-over-year decline" for the past two decades and that "fee structures—paid directly by investors or indirectly through portfolio companies—are prone to extensive manipulation." Lisa Donner, co-executive director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, said that "private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." "Now they want fees from the trillions of dollars in individual retirement accounts," Donner added, "putting millions of more people at risk."

Title: Oligarch’s Heirs Reveal US Fund Bets in Family Office Revamp

Badri Patarkatsishvili’s family set up a firm to manage his multibillion-dollar fortune after the mustachioed Georgian tycoon died suddenly at his English mansion in 2008. As his heirs fended off opportunists seeking a slice of the billionaire’s assets, the money manager kept a low profile, offering few details of how it handled the wealth he amassed alongside fellow oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That’s starting to change. The Patarkatsishvilis’ family office, Bili Capital, has revealed more than two dozen bets on funds from some of the biggest names in global finance, including BlackRock Inc. and Ares Management Corp., on a recently launched website. Patarkatsishvili’s 70-year-old widow, Inna, the de facto head of the family after his death, also ceded her stake in the firm within the past year, registry filings show. That move coincides with the resolution of a long-running legal battle over the fortune of Georgia’s one-time richest man, and has separately led to Inna’s son-in-law, Yevhen Hunyak, 51, becoming Bili Capital’s only shareholder. As a result, a second-generation member is now in sole control of one of London’s biggest — and historically most discreet — family offices for the first time. A representative for the Patarkatsishvili dynasty, who describe Bili Capital as a multi-generational family office overseeing more than $1 billion in assets, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The disclosures give rare insight into one of the biggest fortunes to emerge from Russia’s so-called “wild ‘90s” as the country transitioned from communism to a market-based economy. They also make the once-secretive Bili Capital more transparent than many other family offices, whose public profiles often comprise a single-page website with little information. At least one-fifth of individuals among the world’s 500 biggest fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totaling more than $4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bili Capital’s “transparency on what they’re doing makes them much more accessible, and relatable, to the outside world,” said David Hawkins, founder of Cliveden Advisory, a strategic consulting and reputation-management firm for ultra-wealthy individuals. “They likely want to do more deals.” Bili Capital’s other fund allocations include Silicon Valley venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, index-fund pioneer Vanguard and Mubadala-backed Fortress Investment Group. It also oversees direct stakes in a Georgia theme park, a mineral-water company and a real estate developer serving Miami’s Fisher Island enclave for the ultra-wealthy. ‘The Muscle’ Patarkatsishvili began to build his fortune in the early 1990s when he teamed up with Berezovsky, one of the most influential oligarchs of that decade, to run car dealership LogoVaz. The pair later partnered with Abramovich to help establish Russian oil giant Sibneft out of state-owned assets, with Berezovsky leveraging his Kremlin connections and Patarkatsishvili keeping business relations running smoothly behind the scenes. “Berezovsky was the public face of their alliance, while Badri was the muscle,” said David Lingelbach, who headed Bank of America Corp.’s Russian operations during the 1990s and is now a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Baltimore. “He’s such an interesting oligarch as everything about him was so opaque. He was one of the most powerful — if not the most powerful – person in Georgia.” In 2001, Abramovich acquired the Sibneft stakes owned by Patarkatsishvili and Berezovsky for more than $1 billion after their relationship with the Kremlin soured. Berezovsky later tried unsuccessfully to sue Abramovich over that deal in one of London’s most high-profile legal battles, before he was found dead at his own English mansion in 2013. Abramovich is worth $7.8 billion today, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. Bili Capital’s revamp comes after years of battles over the patriarch’s assets have receded, freeing his heirs to focus on what’s left of the fortune. Since his death, the family has been entangled in several cases, including a $3 billion claim in 2008 by Berezovsky, who alleged that a portion of his former business partner’s holdings — often stashed in secretive tax havens — rightfully belonged to him. Berezovsky withdrew his claim four years later, while the family also successfully fended off a distant relative positioning themselves as Patarkatsishvili’s heir. Another case dating to 2016 wrapped up this year at the UK’s highest court. By some estimates, the family has recovered at least $2 billion of Patarkatsishvili’s assets, though that’s just a fraction of what his overall wealth was believed to be at the time of his death. Branding Strategy Founded in December 2008, Bili Capital is led by Chief Executive Officer Sergey Ershikov and Chief Financial Officer Ilia Demidov, who both previously worked at Russian lender Alfa-Bank. Like other family offices, the closely held firm isn’t regulated as it doesn’t manage money for external investors, limiting transparency requirements. Allocating to funds instead of striking deals under its own name also allows it to keep a low profile, while its longtime holding entity is in Jersey, a low-tax territory neighboring the UK that offers exemptions from publicly disclosing consolidated accounts. A 2022 job posting for Bili Capital cited further assets including a yacht, a fleet of vehicles and several European homes, underscoring how the firm caters to both the financial affairs and jet-setting lifestyle of its owners. The online post also described the firm developing a “branding” strategy, signaling how it has been considering its public image for years. “Reputational capital is important,” said Hawkins, who also advises family offices. “It’s a necessary form of insurance.” In a section entitled “Meet our family,” Bili Capital’s website features a black-and-white image of Inna accompanied in a countryside setting by her two daughters: Liana, 45, the founder of an arts production company, and Iya, 42, a human rights activist. Iya’s husband Hunyak, the co-founder of a private children’s dental group and Bili Capital’s sole shareholder since September, stands to the right of the three women with a small gap between them. The group are all smiling, with no trace of their past traumas. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Digital tokens have staged recoveries on Thursday as the global crypto market cap increased by over 3% in the past day to $3.83 trillion. While Ethereum’s jump past $3,850 has renewed the ‘altseason’ narrative, commission-free trading site Robinhood has boosted FLOKI and ONDO’s momentum with today’s listing. $FLOKI and $ONDO are now available to trade on Robinhood. pic.twitter.com/RxZlKtaCOS — Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) August 7, 2025 The leading trading platform in the United States has officially listed FLOKI and ONDO. Meanwhile, this is beyond a listing. It is a key step toward crypto mainstream adoption. The listing will open Floki Inu and Ondo to Robinhood’s over 25 million users. Furthermore, crypto-curious investors can explore the meme and RWA assets on a regulated platform. The listing news extended the altcoins’ 24-hour gains to nearly 10% amid renewed retailer appetite. Floki Inu has witnessed a conventional journey in the crypto world. While initially criticized as another meme asset relying on hype, the team has quietly built a robust ecosystem. The project now boasts a vivid metaverse gaming world, Valhalla. Also, it launched the FlokiFi Locker LP token to amplify DeFi security. Moreover, crypto enthusiasts can tap into the University of Floki to learn about the blockchain industry. Licensed trading platforms are now recognizing the developers’ efforts. Commenting on Robinhood support, the team stated: Floki has gone from a meme to a movement, and now it’s sitting alongside the most recognizable assets in crypto and finance, easily accessible to the next wave of everyday investors. $FLOKI is Now Listed on the Robinhood App This marks a huge step forward for Floki, unlocking access to 25+ million users on the most influential retail trading platform in the world.

Robinhood App users can now access the meme token alongside established assets, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and HBAR. Ondo Finance has dominated crypto trends in the past months, attracting users due to its unique approach, prioritizing institutional-level finance. It aims to bring real-world assets like US Treasuries, property, and bonds on-chain. Ondo is bringing global markets onchain. Flipping the switch to a more open, modern financial system. pic.twitter.com/vvdZjtSpvh — Ondo Finance (@OndoFinance) August 7, 2025 Ondo boasts a lucrative product lineup. The OUSG exposes investors to short-term US government bonds. Further, it hosts asset-backed tokens like ENA for on-chain yield hunters. Moreover, the project has entered strategic collaborations with traditional giants like BlackRock, MasterCard, and Goldman Sachs. Indeed, RWA tokenization is becoming a hot narrative in the blockchain space. Institutions seeking to join the craze are looking for secure and regulated channels, and Ondo remains at the forefront of this momentum. The altcoins exhibited bullish trajectories, fueled by the ongoing crypto market rebound and Robinhood listing. Floki Inu hovers at $0.0001117 after an over 8% increase on the daily chart. ONDO surged 7.7% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.9820. However, the weak trading volumes signal short-lived gains, unless accompanied by a continued broad market recovery.

Title: OpenAI Is About to Make Employees Millionaires

It’s a figure so large it almost loses meaning: $500 billion. That is the staggering valuation OpenAI, the company behind the revolutionary ChatGPT, could soon command. The company is in discussions with investors for a deal that would allow its current and former employees to sell their privately held shares, a source familiar with the matter told Gizmodo. This type of deal, known in financial jargon as a secondary sale or a tender offer, would more than double OpenAI’s recent $260 billion valuation, catapulting Sam Altman’s company into the same league as legacy titans like Costco. The news, first reported by The Information and Bloomberg, confirms the AI craze isn’t slowing down. But more importantly, it reveals OpenAI’s secret weapon in the brutal war for talent that is defining Silicon Valley. For the company’s employees, it means a massive payday is coming. For its rivals, it’s a clear signal that OpenAI is willing to pay any price to keep its geniuses in-house. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. To understand why a private company is suddenly worth half a trillion dollars, you have to look beyond its technology and focus on its people. The world of elite AI research is remarkably small, and companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta are locked in a fierce battle to recruit and retain the few hundred minds capable of building the next generation of AI. Recently, this talent war has intensified, with Meta aggressively poaching top AI researchers from OpenAI, reportedly offering salaries well into the millions. How can OpenAI compete with guaranteed multi-million dollar paychecks? By turning its employees’ stock options into real, life-altering wealth. According to the source, OpenAI and potential investors, including Thrive Capital (founded by Josh Kushner, Jared Kushner’s brother), are discussing a deal that would let employees and alumni sell their stock. Based on past sales, many OpenAI staffers could pocket anywhere from $2 million to $10 million each, depending on their equity. This is the power of “golden handcuffs.” An engineer might be tempted by a rival’s massive salary, but it’s much harder to walk away when your current company is allowing you to cash out millions while your remaining stock continues to skyrocket in value. The deal transforms “paper wealth” into a tangible fortune, creating a powerful incentive to stay and see how much higher the valuation can climb. This financial maneuver comes as OpenAI is on a tear. The companyâs annualized revenue has nearly doubled to $12 billion in just a few months, driven by the massive adoption of ChatGPT and its enterprise products. OpenAI also recently secured $8.3 billion in new investment commitments as part of a larger $40 billion funding round. This massive influx of capital is a war chest. Investors are betting that OpenAI is poised for even bigger things, with the highly anticipated launch of GPT-5 expected in the coming weeks. A powerful new model could give it a decisive edge over its main rivals, including Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude. This financial muscle will allow OpenAI to accelerate its research, acquire complementary technologies, and invest in the incredibly expensive computing power needed to train more advanced models. At a time when all major players are in a race to build Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)âAI systems smarter than humansâOpenAI now has the resources to lead the pack. But such a high valuation also raises the stakes. OpenAI will be under immense pressure to deliver on the transformative potential its valuation implies, all while navigating the complex ethical and societal challenges that come with creating world-changing technology. This $500 billion figure confirms OpenAI is the undisputed face of the AI revolution. But it also raises a fundamental question. The company was founded as a non-profit dedicated to ensuring AI benefits all of humanity. Now, it operates as a hyper-capitalist rocket ship, fueled by venture capital and creating immense wealth for a select few. Does the future of AI belong to investors chasing returns and the engineers cashing in, or is there still room for the original mission of building something for everyone? As OpenAI’s valuation soars into the stratosphere, that question becomes more urgent than ever. Correction: A previous version of this article referred to Costco as a “legacy tech titan.” The wholesaler chain has a valuation close to that of OpenAI’s, though it is not a tech company.

Investment advisors at BlackRock will invest up to $1 billion into marketplace programs run by a California-based fintech firm. The San Francisco-based LendingClub Corporation, which offers a suite of deposit and loan products, bought Radius Bank in 2020 for $185 million in cash and stock, becoming one of the first fintechs to acquire a national banking charter. Clarke Roberts, LendingClub’s senior vice president, says the new deal with BlackRock is an “exciting step forward” for the financial services firm. “It also validates the strength of our underwriting, the effectiveness of our marketplace programs, and the trust we’ve earned as a counterparty of choice in this asset class. We want to thank BlackRock for their collaboration and execution, and we look forward to growing this partnership over time.” LendingClub has sold nearly $6 billion in loans via its structured certificates programs since rolling out the offerings in 2023, according to a press release from the firm. LendingClub’s stock, LC, is down more than 1% in the past 24 hours but up more than 28% in the past month. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, saw its stock tick up by nearly 1% on Wednesday. The stock, BLK, is also up more than 4% in the past 30 days.

Title: Can Rupert Murdoch Conquer LA?

The tabloid baron will launch a West Coast version of the New York Post next year. Los Angeles can expect a lot more lurid tabloid coverage in its media future, to judge by the New York Post’s track record It’s been a busy week for Rupert Murdoch, the extremely elder statesman of American yellow journalism. He’s currently fending off a $20 billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who’s seeking revenge from the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal after it ran a story on a nude drawing and lewd note Trump denies he drew or wrote for the man he currently also denies was his close personal friend, Jeffrey Epstein. Trump also has an older score to settle with Murdoch’s Fox News for its early (and accurate) election-night call that Arizona had gone for Biden in 2016. The 94-year-old Murdoch claims his fragile health prevents him from being deposed for Trump’s suit against the Journal anytime soon. Anxious to ensure that the suit goes forward, Trump announced that he had come to an agreement with the frail tabloid titan that he must be apprised of Murdoch’s health every three days—in order to make sure, one assumes, that Murdoch isn’t getting away with anything. While Murdoch may be in delicate health, one of his media properties, the New York Post Media Group, made a surprise announcement this week that it’s expanding into Los Angeles. Murdoch is no stranger to LA. He owned 20th Century Fox for decades until Disney gave him $71.3 billion for the company in 2019. That deal greatly expanded Disney’s intellectual-property archive, but it left the film world with one fewer major studio making theatrical movies and flouting the industry’s now-dominant model of reviving legacy franchises ad infinitum. Murdoch’s new foray into LA media will be called the California Post and is projected to start rolling off the presses next year. What’s surprising is not that Murdoch still wants more of the media world—it’s that in 2025, he’s making a bold move into newspapers. Where every other media guru talks digital and streaming, of AI and YouTube channels and podcast empires, Murdoch chose to return to his 1950s roots in Adelaide, Australia. Back then, he had a particular genius for sensing weak newspapers in untapped, vital markets. And true to form, Murdoch and his top print team at the New York Post sensed a media market so underserved, and a competitor so weak, it must have reminded Murdoch of an ailing Aussie backwater recycler—Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times. “Los Angeles is fast becoming a news desert,” the Post’s PR flacks announced on Monday. “Thousands of stories are going untold and countless perspectives aren’t being represented by a media ecosystem that has lost touch with the people—especially as the city and state face unprecedented challenges and leadership vacuums.” They’re not wrong. While the paper will be based in LA, Murdoch plans to cover the whole state with the California Post, from the Mexican border to Hollywood to Silicon Valley, Governor Gavin Newsom’s probable presidential run, and the Bay Area. And Murdoch will offer Los Angeles something it has not had in a long time—a tabloid paper. Los Angeles is the second-biggest media market in the country, with a population of 13 million. And yet the Times, the city’s iconic legacy newspaper, currently struggles with a print circulation of less than 70,000 and just over 200,000 online subscribers. The Times’ closest rival is the LA Daily News, with a print circulation of around 56,000. After Soon-Shiong bought the Times, he moved it out of its iconic downtown headquarters in 2018 to El Segundo. He then shut down its printing plant in 2024. At the start of this year, the paper laid off 115 editorial employees—more than 20 percent of its newsroom. This July on Jon Stewart’s podcast, Soon-Shiong announced that the Times will soon go public, under a plan similar to the municipal ownership scheme that’s kept the Green Bay Packers in the possession of its fan base. It’s not clear just how many remaining fans the LA Times can claim, but it’s likely well short of what it would take to reverse the paper’s tailspin. The LA Times blames its woes on this winter’s fires for decimating important print subscriber markets in the Palisades and Altadena, but that doesn’t account for the layoffs or the reported $30–50 million the paper loses annually. The current nosedive goes back to Soon-Shiong’s decision to kill the Times’ 2024 presidential endorsement for Vice President Kamala Harris. In her home state, and in a city targeted by Trump as a blue woke stronghold, Soon-Shiong’s decision looked purely craven. The Times endured the same brutal market reversals that Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post faced after the Amazon baron’s order to spike that paper’s Harris endorsement, suffering a steep drop in subscriptions and an equally devastating loss of credibility among its readership. When Soon-Shiong bought the Times, he wrote in an e-mail to his new staff, “As someone who grew up in apartheid South Africa, I understand the role that journalism needs to play in a free society.” As with Bezos—who was initially hailed as a brave voice against creeping MAGA authoritarianism in Washington—Soon-Shiong rapidly shed his pet image of himself as a supporter of crusading, reform-minded journalism in favor of editorial dictates all but designed to drive away serious news consumers. Bezos remade the Post’s op-ed section into a libertarian agitprop outlet. Soon-Shiong concocted an AI-makeover for the Times’ opinion coverage that assigns a bias meter reading for its published content, once more substituting inert and unreliable tech programming for critical thinking. Needless to say, the section’s editors fled shortly after the gimmicky experiment was announced. Keith Poole, the New York Post’s current editor in chief, sees big opportunities in the Times’s self-inflicted woes: “California is the most populous state in the country, and is the epicenter of entertainment, the AI revolution and advanced manufacturing—not to mention a sports powerhouse,” he said in the statement laying out plans for the California Post. “Yet many stories are not being told, and many viewpoints are not being represented. With the California Post, we will bring a common-sense, issue-based approach to metropolitan journalism.” The California Post should not have much trouble competing with the Times on its Hollywood and sports coverage. When Soon-Shiong took over the paper in 2018 he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” And how did that go? “Of the 14 major pro and college teams in the region, the Times only has a traveling beat writer for the Lakers, Dodgers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA,” The Sporting Tribune recently reported. After the Times sold its printing plant, it discontinued daily box scores, standings, and game stories because the paper’s news deadline was now 3 pm. The Post is also well positioned to have its Hollywood coverage overtake that of the Times. Even though the Times has a huge legacy advantage on this beat, back to publishing the work of reporters like the legendary studio-era gossip troll Hedda Hopper, the modern Times approaches the entertainment scene as just another industry—albeit one central to the region’s economy. Like most tabloid impresarios, Murdoch has always viewed entertainers and celebrities as the lifeblood of circulation. The British phone-hacking scandal, and the sensationalist coverage in the Post’s successful Page Six gossip franchise both underline how Murdoch properties thrive on gut-punch celebrity gotcha reporting. It’s a safe bet that the California Post will fill a massive gossip void in LA’s mainstream Hollywood coverage. Certainly there’s no shortage of paparazzi and TMZ-style scandal reporting coming out of LA—but you don’t find it in the Times or trade outlets like The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline. This week, the Times’ Hollywood Inc. section is covering the exits of several Paramount executives and management hires under the new Skydance buyout of the studio, as well as news of recent streaming deals. Page Six includes bikini photos of Gwyneth Paltrow’s daughter, Apple Martin, Raven Symone talking about her ex-boyfriend getting someone else pregnant and asking Raven to be the godmother, and paparazzi shots of Denise Richard with a possible black eye and allusions to domestic violence. It’s not that Los Angelenos are above that sort of thing, but the prestige-driven daily papers and trades want us to be. Murdoch knows we’re not, and it’s a market that’s never failed him. John Nichols Joan Walsh Sarah Sophie Flicker Ben Schwartz But the broader challenge here is that the Post’s understanding of “commonsense” journalism is anathema to the Los Angeles reader base. The irony is that Soon-Shiong, in his fumbling mogul way, is already steering his paper toward a money-losing and MAGA-appeasing worldview. If that pivot costs him up to $50 million a year, and prompted the paper’s desperate move to a crowd-funded business model, why does the NY Post think it will fare any better by injecting “many viewpoints” into the mediasphere of Southern California? This week, Poole’s Post ran a cover featuring Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani and Senator Elizabeth Warren meeting in New York with the headline “African-American meets Native American.” It’s hard to see how a parallel embrace of race-baiting will appeal to readers in LA—particularly given Trump’s steady barrage of ICE raids at workplaces, churches, and playgrounds, all backstopped by the cynical deployment of members of the National Guard and United States Marines as political props. For this and countless other reasons, LA and New York do not have the same political base. LA’s last Republican mayor left office in 2001. It’s true that the California Post plans a statewide marketing strategy, meaning that the right-wing voters in the state’s interior, as well as Orange County and San Diego, could rally to the paper—though that will likely still be a tough sell to MAGA followers who increasingly consume news online and via social media and know that Trump views Murdoch as an enemy. Maybe Murdoch’s dramatic expansion plan will yield a robust new audience for the Post’s right-leaning tabloid fare—but it seems far more likely that, at least in LA, the California Post will join Murdoch’s acquisitions of MySpace and Vice Media as a big media bet that somebody should have talked him out of. In this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump. We’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel. The Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here? At The Nation, we know which side we’re on. Every day, we make the case for a more democratic and equal world by championing progressive leaders, lifting up movements fighting for justice, and exposing the oligarchs and corporations profiting at the expense of us all. Our independent journalism informs and empowers progressives across the country and helps bring this politics to new readers ready to join the fight. We need your help to continue this work. Will you donate to support The Nation’s independent journalism? Every contribution goes to our award-winning reporting, analysis, and commentary. Thank you for helping us take on Trump and build the just society we know is possible.

I still recommend the article below by John Ruehl because it provides a detailed discussion of the growth and development of the corporate form, going back to precursors in the Roman Republic. However, when he gets to the modern era, he makes some glaring error which ironically undermine his effort to depict modern large corporations as dangerously unaccountable to the public’s interest. First, Ruehl perpetuates the canard that corporations exist to serve shareholders, citing a too-often invoked Michigan ruling. In fact, shareholders are residual claimants. All others from the supplier to employees to the landlord to the taxman come ahead. We’ve debunked this idea long form many times. Hoisting from a 2014 post: One of my pet peeves is the degree to which the notion that corporations exist only to serve the interests of shareholders is accepted as dogma and recited uncritically by the business press. I’m old enough to remember when that was idea would have been considered extreme and reckless. Corporations are a legal structure and are subject to a number of government and contractual obligations and financial claims. Equity holders are the lowest level of financial claim. It’s one thing to make sure they are not cheated, misled, or abused, but quite another to take the position that the last should be first. As we wrote last year: If you review any of the numerous guides prepared for directors of corporations prepared by law firms and other experts, you won’t find a stipulation for them to maximize shareholder value on the list of things they are supposed to do. It’s not a legal requirement. And there is a good reason for that. Directors and officers, broadly speaking, have a duty of care and duty of loyalty to the corporation. From that flow more specific obligations under Federal and state law. But notice: those responsibilities are to the corporation, not to shareholders in particular…Shareholders are at the very back of the line. They get their piece only after everyone else is satisfied. If you read between the lines of the duties of directors and officers, the implicit “don’t go bankrupt” duty clearly trumps concerns about shareholders… So how did this “the last shall come first” thinking become established? You can blame it all on economists, specifically Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen. In other words, this idea did not come out of legal analysis, changes in regulation, or court decisions. It was simply an academic theory that went mainstream. And to add insult to injury, the version of the Jensen formula that became popular was its worst possible embodiment. One good source for the fact that economists, rather than legal decisions, were the basis for the acceptance of this idea, is a 2005 article by Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn, “Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value.” This paper looked back to the 1970s, the era of diversified and often underperforming firms (remember the conglomerate discount?). Deregulation, high inflation, and a lax attitude towards anti-trust enforcment stoked a hostile takeover boom. Economists celebrated this development as disciplining chief executives and moving assets into the hands of managers who could operate them more productively. In reality, the success of these early deals depended mainly on asset sales, both of non-core operations and of hidden sources of value, like corporate real estate, as well as leverage and slashing bloated head office staffs (the across-the-company headcount efforts became more prominent in the 1990s). Later in that post, we describe the seminal role of an internally inconsistent New York Times op-ed in 1970 in starting this ideological ball rolling. Another serious sour note is when Ruehl depicts the like of BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard as wielding enormous influence with corporations. Earth to base, they don’t. These huge shareholders are indexers. Their business in index replication at the lowest cost. They don’t sell shares because they don’t like how a company is run. They might lighten up because its price falls and so it represents a smaller amount of the index. On top of that, all of these giant fund managers compete for the lucrative 401 (k) business of public companies. Think they are going to sabotage getting those mandates by pressuring the C-Suite? Even for active manager, this idea of investor influence was eviscerated in Amar Bhide’s classic Harvard Business Review article, Efficient Markets, Deficient Governance. Aside from a small cohort of activist fund managers (aka greenmmail artists), even a big fund manager will not hold a large enough position of a public company to make it worth the bother to get them to shape up. It’s easier to sell a stock whose management is doing things you don’t like. One proof of the impotence of big shareholders: In 2009, investors got wind of Goldman’s intent to pay staff big bonuses. They were opposed, seeing it as a slap in the face to taxpayers who’d bailed them out. A group visited CEO LLoyd Blankfein to tell him they strongly opposed the plan. Blankfein went ahead anyhow. So the real scandal here is not investor influence. It’s an agency problem, that top executives control corporate assets and influence the fate of employees and communities, yet for the most part are accountable only to themselves. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute Home to almost 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, Delaware’s reputation as America’s “corporate capital” has faced challenges in recent years. Tesla’s and SpaceX’s high-profile exits to Texas in 2024highlighted other cracks in Delaware’s seamless relationship with large corporations, compounded by other states jockeying to attract businesses. Delaware’s government has launched a legislative charm offensive in response, passing several amendments in March 2025, which have eased restrictions on insider deals and reinforced the state’s commitments to low taxes and a business-friendly legal framework. Corporations can be created in minutes almost anywhere, yet all share a core identity as legal entities with rights and responsibilities. Over time, they have replaced religious institutions and political parties as the most powerful actors in society, largely shaping what we consume, how we work, and influencing behavior and social norms. Their modern form traces back to 17th-century charters, with roots in Roman law. Though often tools of the state, global corporations have proven capable of operating across borders and legal systems, developing unprecedented sovereignty and power. The benefits of corporations, including lower prices from scale, capital-driven innovation and efficiency, and global reach, have been undermined by the relentless accumulation of financial assets, particularly in the West. Short-term gains often supersede long-term value and sustainability, and despite stronger regulation on paper, modern corporations operate with greater independence from the state and increasingly avoid public accountability. The basic model behind them remains intact, with core legal principles like limited liability and separate legal personality, stemming from early corporate charters from the 1600s and fully developed by the 1800s, still forming the corporate foundation despite enormous growth in their scale and influence. Over the years, calls for democratic renewal and institutional imagination have been mounting, pointing to a long-overdue rethinking of corporate power. Building up to and Defining the Corporation Before modern corporations, societies around the world developed institutions to pool capital and dilute risk for trade, construction, and investment. In the Roman Republic, societas publicanorum had transferable shares (partes), professional managers, and central offices, and bid on state contracts for tax collection and infrastructure. However, Roman law allowed any partner to dissolve the business at will, limiting their longevity, and these types of partnerships faded under the empire’s centralized bureaucracy. After 313 CE, following the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity, the Catholic Church gained legal standing that helped it become one of Europe’s first enduring corporate-like entities. By the eighth century, European monarchs began issuing charters that bestowed privileges to monasteries, universities, towns, and tax collection, while guilds of merchants and artisans also emerged in the 11th century. This century also saw the emergence of the commenda in Italy, which allowed passive investors to fund merchant voyages for a share of the profits, an early form of limited liability that spread across Europe. Family banking dynasties from Florence emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, building pan-European financial networks and eventually expanding to other industries like mining and manufacturing. Similar models developed globally. The commenda is believed to be inspired by Islamic qiradpartnerships that began in the sixth century, where one party provided the capital and the other conducted trade. Beginning in the 1600s, large family firms in China thrived with imperial support. Maritime guilds thrived in Southeast Asian port cities like Majapahit and Srivijaya. Still, it was in Europe, where Roman and Canon Law fused, that legal innovation evolved most dramatically and took on the modern corporate form by the 17th century. Before the rise of modern corporations, most businesses were family-run shops, temporary partnerships, or informal arrangements that lacked legal separation from their owners. What earlier institutions lacked was the five features defining the modern corporation; representation allowing designated agents to act on behalf of the firm without binding investors; entity-shielding protecting corporate assets from the debts of investors; capital lock-in preventing investors from pulling funds or forcing liquidation; transferable shares letting investors exit without disrupting operations; and limited liability ensuring investors aren’t personally responsible for corporate debts. The most foundational corporate characteristic is a legal personality, the ability to exist separately from its owners, with its own rights and responsibilities. From the Latin corpus (“body”), this concept lends context to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s controversial 2011 remark that “corporations are people.” These features enable corporations to attract capital, own property, sign contracts, and avoid dissolution with membership changes. They vary widely from public to private, with tradable or restricted shares, and can be state-owned, profit-driven, or mission-based. But nearly all corporations share these core traits, which have been used by some to build the most flexible, powerful, and enduring institutions ever created. The Dutch and British East India Trading Companies The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, is widely considered the first modern multinational corporation. Though joint-stock ventures had existed earlier (mostly as short-term partnerships for single voyages), the VOC stood apart by introducing permanent capital, tradable shares, and a form of limited liability, attracting strong investment. As maritime trade and colonialism expanded over the previous century, long-term capital was increasingly required for risky, lucrative ventures in spices, textiles, and tea. The VOC met this demand by locking in investment, limiting shareholder exposure, and providing an orderly way to exit. Backed by the Dutch state, it merged competing firms into a single entity with centralized management, enabling it to scale up with unprecedented freedom. Dutch political institutions also played a role in the VOC’s power. As a new republic, the Netherlands offered investors protection from royal interference. Unlike other European countries where royal families funded and closely monitored colonial expeditions, the VOC operated with more autonomy. It received a perpetual charter and became the first company listed on a stock exchange, and was empowered to sign treaties, raise armies, and wage war, all while shielding shareholders from personal accountability. Despite collapsing in 1799 due to debt and corruption, it pioneered a corporate form unlike anything before. Two years before the VOC’s founding, its counterpart, the English East India Company (EIC), was formed in 1600. The EIC didn’t obtain permanent capital until 1657 and was slower to adopt liquidity. But the English Civil War curbed royal power after 1657, allowing it to evolve in ways that mirrored the VOC. The Bank of England, founded as a corporation in 1694, helped stabilize credit lines and made it easier for the EIC and other corporations to raise capital. The EIC eventually came to colonize and rule large parts of India, establishing a civil service and even clashing militarily with the VOC. Yet its power drew intense scrutiny. Following the Bengal Famine of 1770, the English parliament passed the Regulating Act of 1773 and Pitt’s India Act of 1784, curbing the EIC’s powers. The company was finally dissolved in 1874. “In 1857, the Indians rose in revolt against high-handed and oppressive Company rule… The Company lost all its administrative powers following the Government of India Act of 1858, and its Indian possessions and armed forces were taken over by the Crown. … The East India Company itself was formally dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1874,” according to the UK Parliament website. Though the VOC’s model was emulated by the EIC and influenced commercial ventures elsewhere in Europe, such corporations remained a form of special incorporation granted by state charter, not open to anyone. This exclusivity began to loosen over time, but the South Sea Bubble crash of 1720, seen as the first major financial crash, triggered fears of economic instability and unchecked corporate power. In response, governments reimposed strict controls, requiring corporations to obtain specific approval and follow stringent guidelines. Corporations proved essential during Britain’s industrial revolution, which began in the late 1700s. To support economic growth, parliament introduced reforms: the Joint Stock Companies Regulation and Registration Act of 1844 allowed businesses to register without special legislation, while the Limited Liability Act of 1855 extended legal protections to shareholders. These reforms, combined with Britain’s access to capital markets and imperial power, kick-started rapid corporate expansion in Europe. Arriving late to maritime trade, the Dutch and English drove corporate innovation to keep up with other European powers. Politicians supported corporate growth, benefiting from lucrative shares in the monopolies they helped create. But the VOC and EIC demonstrated the promise and peril of corporations. They could generate wealth and wield power beyond what states alone could achieve, but they also bred corruption and posed political threats. European leaders, therefore, aimed to harness the benefits of corporations while limiting their power by closely tying them to government control. The United States and the Modern Corporate Form Early British joint-stock companies like the Virginia Company planted the first corporate seeds in North America in the early 17th century. But while European models like the VOC and EIC inspired early colonial enterprises, the corporate form developed more slowly in the U.S. after independence, in both scale and structure. Shaped by a deep-rooted “distrust” of monopolies and state-chartered privilege, and wary of corporations as instruments of elite power and financial instability, many Americans didn’t trust companies that had special deals with the government. Instead, they preferred smaller, more personal business models like family-run shops, partnerships between a few people, or joint-stock ventures where people pooled money but didn’t have the legal structure of modern corporations that offered them protections. The early U.S. enterprises also lacked strong, centralized authority and consistent legal protections, especially for property and contracts, and many investors in states like Florida, Texas, and California avoided corporate structures until they were included in the U.S. Constitution. Yet this decentralized system ultimately gave corporations room to grow. Without strong federal control, states competed to attract businesses by loosening incorporation requirements. New York led with the first general incorporation law for manufacturers in 1811, with other states soon following and expanding the scope of the law. The vast, unexploited North American landmass and push for industrialization made the corporate structure increasingly attractive, further aided by America’s quicker and widespread adoption of limited liability and lighter state oversight compared to Europe. While state legislatures tried to regulate corporations with rules on capitalization, voting rights, and director terms, these measures proved mostly ineffective. Corporations amassed enormous influence, with “company towns” illustrating their growing control over local economies and governance. Corporate imperialism returned under an American banner, with the United Fruit Company, which controlled enormous banana plantations in Central America and used its political influence to overthrow governments. These towns still exist in some shape or form today. “The original coal and textile towns in America are now largely ghostly, but places like Hershey and Corning, New York, which were invigorated by the Corning glass company, are still going strong. Plus, as the LA Times writes, businesses such as Google and Facebook today are providing housing, amenities, and transportation for their workers—meaning that while we think of company towns in sepia tones, they’re also in digital blue,” statesSmithsonian magazine. In The Visible Hand, Alfred D. Chandler Jr. suggests that the dominance of American corporations by the 20th century was due to their managerial hierarchies rather than entrepreneurs, which provided them with stability, coordination, and centralized planning. This is partly supported in The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea, which argues that robber barons were replaced by “the faceless manager” and the multidivisional firm. By the 1930s, legal scholar Adolf A. Berle and economist Gardiner C. Means, whose work shaped modern corporate governance theory, warned that dispersed shareholders had lost control to entrenched managers and called for reforms in corporate oversight. The 1919 Dodge v. Ford case had already enshrined shareholder primacy in U.S. law, declaring that directors must prioritize shareholder profits. But rather than democratizing ownership, the rise of institutional investors, like pension and mutual funds, and other financial giants, further concentrated power among select shareholders. By the end of the 20th century, globalization offered American corporations, as well as others, a platform to dominate beyond natural borders. The American corporate model became the ruling template in a worldwide ecosystem, largely controlled by shareholder interests and executive compensation tied to quarterly earnings pressures. The Growing Power of Corporations Over time, corporations have become the dominant business entities. Despite only representing 18 percent of U.S. businesses, corporations generate nearly 82 percent of all revenues. Around 20,000 large corporations employ as many people as the 31.7 million small businesses, according to the 2024 data provided by payment processor company Clearly Payments. Many of them now function as monopolies or organized cartels. In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, the Supreme Court affirmed that corporations have First Amendment rights, including the right to “use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.” Borderless by design, major corporations drive a race to the bottom for cheap international labor and pass sustainability costs onto consumers. Countries often lack the strength to rein them in, and where they can, corporations simply exploit tax havens and flexible jurisdictions. As economist Lynn A. Stout observed, outdated yet profitable business practices like shareholder primacy are hard to shake. Accountability and sustainability appear largely ignored, with corporations long prioritizing profit over public safety. Asbestos manufacturers suppressed evidence of its deadly health effects to keep selling their products. Tobacco firms knowingly misled the public about cancer risks for decades.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, used its LLC status and shell corporations to dodge accountability for the opioid crisis. According to an Associated Press investigation, “the Sacklers’ wealth is shielded in a web of companies and trusts, some registered in offshore tax havens far from Purdue’s Connecticut headquarters,” states a 2019 article by CBS News. Calls for corporate responsibility have grown as the power of corporations has increased. The corporate social responsibility movement began with philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and resurged in the 1970s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, ESG and stakeholder activism sought to revive this initiative, but became politicized and have waned, even as corporate influence continues to grow. As “universal owners” of the economy, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street control vast shares and command corporate influence. While it was hoped their broad holdings would make them stewards of the economy, short-term thinking and weak oversight continue to limit meaningful action like prioritizing long-term sustainability, fair labor practices, and avoiding hoarding wealth. Corporations are wielding new tools of dominance through AI and digital technologies. “Companies such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, Koch Industries, Maersk, Siemens, and Unilever are using AI tools to swiftly find and engage with alternative suppliers during unexpected disruptions. They are also employing AI tools to pre-qualify suppliers ahead of time. These AI tools provide buyers with enhanced information that allows them to beat their competitors in securing alternate sources of supplies,” points out a Harvard Business Review 2023 article. They can also deflect accountability through PR campaigns, obscure controversies through complex supply chains and legal structures, and offload responsibility to subsidiaries, contractors, or consumers. Combined with the growing use of private military and security contractors, some modern corporations operating in unstable or contested regions are regaining a degree of coercive power reminiscent of the colonial-era trading giants. The core problem is that while we retain some voice in the political system, that influence doesn’t extend to massive corporate structures. “Voting with our wallets” offers little power when essential services are dominated by a handful of interconnected firms. Reform While the corporate model dominates, alternatives continue to evolve. In early 20th-century China, corporate law was weakly enforced, and corporations were uncommon. Today, China exerts control over both state-owned and private corporations, embedding Chinese Communist Party officials into corporate governance. This hybrid model places corporate activity under tighter oversight, supported in part by nationwide social credit scores for all companies. President Teddy Roosevelt promoted trust-busting as the solution to corporate abuse by big business, but as economist Lawrence Mitchell notes, the prior era of fierce competition among smaller companies was also disastrous. He identified the real problem of states competing for corporate charters in a “race to the bottom,” a danger that Justice Louis Brandeis also noted in 1933. Roosevelt even acknowledged in 1902 that only the federal government could properly regulate interstate corporations, which Mitchell supports. So, how should governments regulate monopolies? Some countries have taken a more open approach to consolidation. The German government, for example, legalized collusion and cartel formation to control prices and output in ways that serve national interests, actively encouraging the attempted merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank since 2019. Cooperatives offer another path. The first successful cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was founded in 1844 in the UK, championing democratic control, open membership, and profit-sharing. In Spain, the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker-owned cooperatives founded in 1956, has become the “leading business project in the Basque Country and one of the largest corporations in Spain.” Rather than lay off workers, Mondragon often reallocates them across its network. New reformist approaches are also emerging in Europe. France’s 2019 PACTE Act allows companies to define a social purpose beyond profit, embedding missions into corporate charters and expanding employee influence in mergers and executive oversight. Economist Mariana Mazzucato has promoted this mission-driven model as part of her vision for innovation-led governance. In the U.S., Delaware’s recent legislative push is part of a broader effort challenging shareholder primacy, notably since the 2019 Business Roundtable, where top CEOs pledged to serve all stakeholders. Delaware and other American states already allow businesses to register as benefit corporations (B-corps), balancing profits with goals like environmental protection or community development. Existing corporations can convert by amending their founding documents. CHS Inc., a major agricultural cooperative ranked 115th on the Forbes 500 list in 2025, meanwhile, demonstrates how cooperative principles still have traction in the country. It has emerged as one of the “largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the world.” Digital finance is also leading to experimentation in how businesses are owned and operated. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, are blockchain-based communities with decentralized governance that make decisions by vote. Aiming for transparency and shared control, they face clear hurdles. Unclear legal status has slowed adoption, while security flaws, including a major 2016 breach, have seen millions stolen due to a code exploit. Governance challengesinclude low participation, power centralization, and slow decision-making. “In some high-profile DAOs, the majority of governance tokens are often held by the founders and early investors, which can skew decision outcomes in favor of their interests rather than the broader community,” states a blog by Colony, a platform providing a framework for DAOs. Not all innovation prioritizes the public good. The “Network State” concept, coined by tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, envisions venture-backed private cities, colonies, and zones across the U.S., Latin America, Africa, and beyond. These digital-first enclaves aim for diplomatic recognition and eventual sovereignty through special economic zones, framing private microstates as expressions of libertarian freedom. Efforts to reduce shareholder power can also backfire by merely concentrating power in the hands of corporate managers rather than all stakeholders. Elon Musk is a clear example; by retaining large ownership stakes, employing dual-class shares, and keeping firms like X, Tesla, and SpaceX private or under holding structures, he has shielded himself from shareholder influence while consolidating control. The planned incorporation of Starbase, Texas, a township effectively governed by SpaceX, demonstrates how this management style can dovetail with Network State ambitions. Born in the Dutch Republic, matured in England, and transformed by the United States, the march of the modern corporation has proven remarkably resilient over the centuries. Hudson’s Bay Company, founded in 1670 as an English trading giant like the EIC, once controlled vast swaths of North America and now exists as a retail chain. Corporate power in general, however, continues to expand. After early overreach by the VOC and EIC prompted containment efforts, corporations have resurged through globalization, financialization, and advances in technology. Short-term profit maximization is seen as natural, with structures geared away from wider stakeholder responsibility. Many firms resist direct governance to escape the negative optics of being seen as too powerful, which would bring more scrutiny and accountability. Yet some corporations have grown so large that they have become pillars of modern society and carry significant responsibility, even if they do not openly acknowledge it. Without altering their growing influence, the future will be shaped less by democratic will through established channels and more by concentrated, private authority. ‘So, how should governments regulate monopolies?’ I’m sure that the Chinese have a few good ideas. If any of their billionaires get out of line and start muscling in on the government (cough*Jack Ma*cough), they tend to go missing. Sometimes they turn back up again. Sometimes they don’t. In reading this article, I was struck how he insisted that corporations must aim for ‘longevity’. But in one of John Michael Greer’s novels – “Retrotopia” – he mentioned that it was not always so. That for example a corporation might be set up to build a road, it would raise the funds needed, it would then use those funds to have the road built, set aside money for maintenance, and would then dissolve itself after having completed the purpose that it was set up for. That sounded so strange the first time I read that. Some of it may depend on the type of corporation. A couple of examples from the entertainment and real estate areas. in the entertainment industry it is not uncommon for there to be a production company formed strictly for the production of one movie or television show. Because of the way it is financed or distributed it is hard to tell when you look at the credits. (As they are involved in distribution it does allow for some leeway in getting satisfaction if there is a problem.) The real estate part I know of is that it is not unheard of for the bigger company to form a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) to actually construct a building. After the building is built the LLC “sells” the building but it is always done that they continue to hold all responsibilities for the construction, but that is just for show as it ceases to exist. “Blankfein went ahead anyhow.” Sounds like Llyod could serve in any number of ‘representative’ elected offices. Interesting reading the background to the idea corporations have to but shareholders first. It always bugged me for two reasons. I mean General Electric couldn’t decide ro day that they were going to start importing and selling heroin as they thought it would give a better return to shareholders. Clearly they still have to follow the laws of the land of face the consequences. And secondly, even if it was the case that it was a legal requirement, so what? It’s nit a law of nature or of physics. It could only ever be a law of man and those can be changed. As I recall, some conservatives advocate that corporations should violate laws if the profits ensuing from violating the laws are larger than the associated penalty. Maybe this is a calculation done by citizens as well, so corporations would be following Citizens United into people hood. A country could enforce laws and set the penalties for law violation high enough to discourage societal harmful behaviors. But the USA seems to have harsh justice for little people with a policy of “friends don’t let friends do time” for the rich and connected. I never go over the Ford pardon of Nixon as the pardon was justified as healing to the nation and Nixon had “suffered enough”. . In an it will never happen desire, I desperately want there to be minimum fines attached to overcharging or embezzling the government. I recognize that the system has been gamed enough that they don’t even have to pay back the government (see the special master throwing out the DOJ case against United Health for overcharging Medicare by 2 billion dollars), but in my world not only would it be incumbent on United Health for proving that the various supposed treatments occurred and that the charges were accurate for those treatments. And if they weren’t they would be required to pay back the full amount plus an additional 50% of that amount just to keep their C suite executives out of jail. There should be no return on investment for deceiving customers and employees. AND bankruptcy law should be rewritten to have owner corporation continue to be on the stick for any lawsuits or liabilities from fraud or malfeasance of fully owned subsidiaries rather than allowing that to die with the bankruptcy of said subsidiary. Whenever I hear of a corporation skating in some manner, I remember that beacon of Republican responsibility prosecuting minor crimes in NY left and right (homeless people washing windshields, minor drug offenses, etc) because that was going to increase overall adherence to the law. I always compared it to the trickle down theory as in all profits go to the top and all penalties go to the bottom. It’s not really talked about much outside of law journals but all of the British colonies in America were set up as corporate entities, not just the Virginia Company. If you read the charters of each of them, it’s truly not far off from corporate organization documents of today. The legacy of this structure remains and it seems very anachronistic but I guess it’s all we got. +1 on the reform path of Cooperatives. Just change the bylaws of a corporation to one member = one share/vote, you bring in democracy and accountability of the management to the workers. And I know this may sound crazy, but if, in the same spirit and reasoning chattel slavery was made illegal, we could do the same to human rental (i.e. wage system), all corporations with employees would effectively have to become Worker-Cooperatives. Instead of Capital renting humans, Humans would rent capital, which makes much more sense. It’s a great path towards democracy….. The venerable Hudson’s Bay Company shuttered its last retail store just a few months ago. The end of an era. Fond memories of their iconic point blankets and clothing. I bought one of the point blankets a couple of years ago as a sort of nostalgic, ironic hat tip to the early days of Canadian colonization, well aware as I am of the horrors that came with it. They were not made in Canada — Yorkshire, I think. I have no love for the Weston family but they just bought the original HBC charter and are donating it to a museum. https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/the-mix/not-meant-to-be-manitoba-museum-reflects-as-bay-charter-heads-elsewhere-11049467 HBC was Canada’s East India Company, another example of colonialism at its worst. Very fine intro, Yves. A corporate charter was at one time simply a grant by the sovereign of limited liability to protect investors from being dragged underwater by a failing business concern. An investor might lose their share value in a business failure but their other assets were protected. This promoted investment in enterprises which benefitted the polity as a whole by building necessary infrastructure and providing employment. Under today’s system of Inverted Totalitarianism the corporations control the sovereign state through massive infusions of campaign cash while looting infrastructure and destroying employment in order to enrich corporate executives and officers encouraged by stock “incentive” compensation to game short-term performance through looting. Self-dealing executives and officers becoming major shareholders created an enormous conflict of interest. The “Last have become the First” negating the entire social justification for a sovereign grant of corporate status. All of which was proceeded by an ideology cut from/cobbled together and funded by Capital from bastardized theology aka TINA/Powell memo thingy … Thank you, Yves, for this article and the fine commentary. It’s indeed frustrating to see the zombie shareholder primacy myth making rounds, raising again from the dead to eat our brains. That’s specially true when the author even cites Lynn Stout, arguably the most important scholar to debunk this myth. But there’s one point I wanted to ask you for further thoughts, if you’d be kind enough to bear with me. I always thought that it was part of the plan for the ETF managers of the world (particularly BlackRock) to wield greater influence over big corporations. They certainly make loads of money with ETF on their own right, but when you index something like S&P500, you’re making sure you have the right stocks, i.e. of the corporations that actually matter right now. Ditto for oil, tech, whatever. It makes it much easier to coordinate a strategy among them. The common assumption is that Blackrock, Vanguard etc. are sitting on their hands with that much power on their hands. Although you’re right that they won’t sell the shares as a form of pressure, they can still vote as shareholders. Not selling their shares makes their threat more worrisome in this case. BlackRock became more notorious because it tried to do the old Whig/Democrat/liberal/”woke” thing of pretending to care about ESG etc. and, after this is accepted and normalized, legitimately exert its own illegitimate control for its own purposes. As the article noticed, the worst kind of push-back materialized (the Tory/Republican/”conservative” one); instead of pretending to care, we won’t even pretend anymore and outright burn anyone suggesting that we care about the environment, society, workers, consumers… Unfortunately, most of the evidence I have is my tin foil hat and the eternal lust for power of these groups. But you really think that the voting rights they get from significant proportions of shares in big companies is siting idle? I also don’t think I understood the 401(k) argument. Is it that corporations choose these institutional investors for managing the pension funds? Thanks for bearing with me! No, they will always vote with management (save extremely bad governance abuses) because they want the 401(k) business, which has vastly higher margins than running index funds. Tons of fees and grifting via how they handle trades by plan participants in and out of funds. Also the margins on index funds are too thin to support any kind of corporate lobbying. You actually have to have a reasoned position on important proxy issues. That takes staff. Indexers compete on the tightness of their index replication and having the lowest fees possible. Any extra expenses undermine competitiveness. A finer epitaph I know not … The link to the 1919 Dodge v. Ford case was interesting. Yves, great intro! The pep talks we got from upper management about “shareholder values” always made more sense when one substituted “my bonus”. And once all my co-workers saw how they were implementing these “shareholder values”, we realized that had morphed into “bone us”. Your email address will not be published.

Yves here. It’s frustrating to see a piece that presents itself as well researched get information important to its argument wrong. I still recommend the article below by John Ruehl because it provides a detailed discussion of the growth and development of the corporate form, going back to precursors in the Roman Republic. However, when he gets to the modern era, he makes some glaring error which ironically undermine his effort to depict modern large corporations as dangerously unaccountable to the public’s interest. First, Ruehl perpetuates the canard that corporations exist to serve shareholders, citing a too-often invoked Michigan ruling. In fact, shareholders are residual claimants. All others from the supplier to employees to the landlord to the taxman come ahead. We’ve debunked this idea long form many times. Hoisting from a 2014 post: One of my pet peeves is the degree to which the notion that corporations exist only to serve the interests of shareholders is accepted as dogma and recited uncritically by the business press. I’m old enough to remember when that was idea would have been considered extreme and reckless. Corporations are a legal structure and are subject to a number of government and contractual obligations and financial claims. Equity holders are the lowest level of financial claim. It’s one thing to make sure they are not cheated, misled, or abused, but quite another to take the position that the last should be first. As we wrote last year: If you review any of the numerous guides prepared for directors of corporations prepared by law firms and other experts, you won’t find a stipulation for them to maximize shareholder value on the list of things they are supposed to do. It’s not a legal requirement. And there is a good reason for that. Directors and officers, broadly speaking, have a duty of care and duty of loyalty to the corporation. From that flow more specific obligations under Federal and state law. But notice: those responsibilities are to the corporation, not to shareholders in particular…Shareholders are at the very back of the line. They get their piece only after everyone else is satisfied. If you read between the lines of the duties of directors and officers, the implicit “don’t go bankrupt” duty clearly trumps concerns about shareholders… So how did this “the last shall come first” thinking become established? You can blame it all on economists, specifically Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen. In other words, this idea did not come out of legal analysis, changes in regulation, or court decisions. It was simply an academic theory that went mainstream. And to add insult to injury, the version of the Jensen formula that became popular was its worst possible embodiment. One good source for the fact that economists, rather than legal decisions, were the basis for the acceptance of this idea, is a 2005 article by Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn, “Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value.” This paper looked back to the 1970s, the era of diversified and often underperforming firms (remember the conglomerate discount?). Deregulation, high inflation, and a lax attitude towards anti-trust enforcment stoked a hostile takeover boom. Economists celebrated this development as disciplining chief executives and moving assets into the hands of managers who could operate them more productively. In reality, the success of these early deals depended mainly on asset sales, both of non-core operations and of hidden sources of value, like corporate real estate, as well as leverage and slashing bloated head office staffs (the across-the-company headcount efforts became more prominent in the 1990s). Later in that post, we describe the seminal role of an internally inconsistent New York Times op-ed in 1970 in starting this ideological ball rolling. Another serious sour note is when Ruehl depicts the like of BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard as wielding enormous influence with corporations. Earth to base, they don’t. These huge shareholders are indexers. Their business in index replication at the lowest cost. They don’t sell shares because they don’t like how a company is run. They might lighten up because its price falls and so it represents a smaller amount of the index. On top of that, all of these giant fund managers compete for the lucrative 401 (k) business of public companies. Think they are going to sabotage getting those mandates by pressuring the C-Suite? Even for active manager, this idea of investor influence was eviscerated in Amar Bhide’s classic Harvard Business Review article, Efficient Markets, Deficient Governance. Aside from a small cohort of activist fund managers (aka greenmmail artists), even a big fund manager will not hold a large enough position of a public company to make it worth the bother to get them to shape up. It’s easier to sell a stock whose management is doing things you don’t like. One proof of the impotence of big shareholders: In 2009, investors got wind of Goldman’s intent to pay staff big bonuses. They were opposed, seeing it as a slap in the face to taxpayers who’d bailed them out. A group visited CEO LLoyd Blankfein to tell him they strongly opposed the plan. Blankfein went ahead anyhow. So the real scandal here is not investor influence. It’s an agency problem, that top executives control corporate assets and influence the fate of employees and communities, yet for the most part are accountable only to themselves. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute Home to almost 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, Delaware’s reputation as America’s “corporate capital” has faced challenges in recent years. Tesla’s and SpaceX’s high-profile exits to Texas in 2024highlighted other cracks in Delaware’s seamless relationship with large corporations, compounded by other states jockeying to attract businesses. Delaware’s government has launched a legislative charm offensive in response, passing several amendments in March 2025, which have eased restrictions on insider deals and reinforced the state’s commitments to low taxes and a business-friendly legal framework. Corporations can be created in minutes almost anywhere, yet all share a core identity as legal entities with rights and responsibilities. Over time, they have replaced religious institutions and political parties as the most powerful actors in society, largely shaping what we consume, how we work, and influencing behavior and social norms. Their modern form traces back to 17th-century charters, with roots in Roman law. Though often tools of the state, global corporations have proven capable of operating across borders and legal systems, developing unprecedented sovereignty and power. The benefits of corporations, including lower prices from scale, capital-driven innovation and efficiency, and global reach, have been undermined by the relentless accumulation of financial assets, particularly in the West. Short-term gains often supersede long-term value and sustainability, and despite stronger regulation on paper, modern corporations operate with greater independence from the state and increasingly avoid public accountability. The basic model behind them remains intact, with core legal principles like limited liability and separate legal personality, stemming from early corporate charters from the 1600s and fully developed by the 1800s, still forming the corporate foundation despite enormous growth in their scale and influence. Over the years, calls for democratic renewal and institutional imagination have been mounting, pointing to a long-overdue rethinking of corporate power. Building up to and Defining the Corporation Before modern corporations, societies around the world developed institutions to pool capital and dilute risk for trade, construction, and investment. In the Roman Republic, societas publicanorum had transferable shares (partes), professional managers, and central offices, and bid on state contracts for tax collection and infrastructure. However, Roman law allowed any partner to dissolve the business at will, limiting their longevity, and these types of partnerships faded under the empire’s centralized bureaucracy. After 313 CE, following the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity, the Catholic Church gained legal standing that helped it become one of Europe’s first enduring corporate-like entities. By the eighth century, European monarchs began issuing charters that bestowed privileges to monasteries, universities, towns, and tax collection, while guilds of merchants and artisans also emerged in the 11th century. This century also saw the emergence of the commenda in Italy, which allowed passive investors to fund merchant voyages for a share of the profits, an early form of limited liability that spread across Europe. Family banking dynasties from Florence emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, building pan-European financial networks and eventually expanding to other industries like mining and manufacturing. Similar models developed globally. The commenda is believed to be inspired by Islamic qiradpartnerships that began in the sixth century, where one party provided the capital and the other conducted trade. Beginning in the 1600s, large family firms in China thrived with imperial support. Maritime guilds thrived in Southeast Asian port cities like Majapahit and Srivijaya. Still, it was in Europe, where Roman and Canon Law fused, that legal innovation evolved most dramatically and took on the modern corporate form by the 17th century. Before the rise of modern corporations, most businesses were family-run shops, temporary partnerships, or informal arrangements that lacked legal separation from their owners. What earlier institutions lacked was the five features defining the modern corporation; representation allowing designated agents to act on behalf of the firm without binding investors; entity-shielding protecting corporate assets from the debts of investors; capital lock-in preventing investors from pulling funds or forcing liquidation; transferable shares letting investors exit without disrupting operations; and limited liability ensuring investors aren’t personally responsible for corporate debts. The most foundational corporate characteristic is a legal personality, the ability to exist separately from its owners, with its own rights and responsibilities. From the Latin corpus (“body”), this concept lends context to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s controversial 2011 remark that “corporations are people.” These features enable corporations to attract capital, own property, sign contracts, and avoid dissolution with membership changes. They vary widely from public to private, with tradable or restricted shares, and can be state-owned, profit-driven, or mission-based. But nearly all corporations share these core traits, which have been used by some to build the most flexible, powerful, and enduring institutions ever created. The Dutch and British East India Trading Companies The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, is widely considered the first modern multinational corporation. Though joint-stock ventures had existed earlier (mostly as short-term partnerships for single voyages), the VOC stood apart by introducing permanent capital, tradable shares, and a form of limited liability, attracting strong investment. As maritime trade and colonialism expanded over the previous century, long-term capital was increasingly required for risky, lucrative ventures in spices, textiles, and tea. The VOC met this demand by locking in investment, limiting shareholder exposure, and providing an orderly way to exit. Backed by the Dutch state, it merged competing firms into a single entity with centralized management, enabling it to scale up with unprecedented freedom. Dutch political institutions also played a role in the VOC’s power. As a new republic, the Netherlands offered investors protection from royal interference. Unlike other European countries where royal families funded and closely monitored colonial expeditions, the VOC operated with more autonomy. It received a perpetual charter and became the first company listed on a stock exchange, and was empowered to sign treaties, raise armies, and wage war, all while shielding shareholders from personal accountability. Despite collapsing in 1799 due to debt and corruption, it pioneered a corporate form unlike anything before. Two years before the VOC’s founding, its counterpart, the English East India Company (EIC), was formed in 1600. The EIC didn’t obtain permanent capital until 1657 and was slower to adopt liquidity. But the English Civil War curbed royal power after 1657, allowing it to evolve in ways that mirrored the VOC. The Bank of England, founded as a corporation in 1694, helped stabilize credit lines and made it easier for the EIC and other corporations to raise capital. The EIC eventually came to colonize and rule large parts of India, establishing a civil service and even clashing militarily with the VOC. Yet its power drew intense scrutiny. Following the Bengal Famine of 1770, the English parliament passed the Regulating Act of 1773 and Pitt’s India Act of 1784, curbing the EIC’s powers. The company was finally dissolved in 1874. “In 1857, the Indians rose in revolt against high-handed and oppressive Company rule… The Company lost all its administrative powers following the Government of India Act of 1858, and its Indian possessions and armed forces were taken over by the Crown. … The East India Company itself was formally dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1874,” according to the UK Parliament website. Though the VOC’s model was emulated by the EIC and influenced commercial ventures elsewhere in Europe, such corporations remained a form of special incorporation granted by state charter, not open to anyone. This exclusivity began to loosen over time, but the South Sea Bubble crash of 1720, seen as the first major financial crash, triggered fears of economic instability and unchecked corporate power. In response, governments reimposed strict controls, requiring corporations to obtain specific approval and follow stringent guidelines. Corporations proved essential during Britain’s industrial revolution, which began in the late 1700s. To support economic growth, parliament introduced reforms: the Joint Stock Companies Regulation and Registration Act of 1844 allowed businesses to register without special legislation, while the Limited Liability Act of 1855 extended legal protections to shareholders. These reforms, combined with Britain’s access to capital markets and imperial power, kick-started rapid corporate expansion in Europe. Arriving late to maritime trade, the Dutch and English drove corporate innovation to keep up with other European powers. Politicians supported corporate growth, benefiting from lucrative shares in the monopolies they helped create. But the VOC and EIC demonstrated the promise and peril of corporations. They could generate wealth and wield power beyond what states alone could achieve, but they also bred corruption and posed political threats. European leaders, therefore, aimed to harness the benefits of corporations while limiting their power by closely tying them to government control. The United States and the Modern Corporate Form Early British joint-stock companies like the Virginia Company planted the first corporate seeds in North America in the early 17th century. But while European models like the VOC and EIC inspired early colonial enterprises, the corporate form developed more slowly in the U.S. after independence, in both scale and structure. Shaped by a deep-rooted “distrust” of monopolies and state-chartered privilege, and wary of corporations as instruments of elite power and financial instability, many Americans didn’t trust companies that had special deals with the government. Instead, they preferred smaller, more personal business models like family-run shops, partnerships between a few people, or joint-stock ventures where people pooled money but didn’t have the legal structure of modern corporations that offered them protections. The early U.S. enterprises also lacked strong, centralized authority and consistent legal protections, especially for property and contracts, and many investors in states like Florida, Texas, and California avoided corporate structures until they were included in the U.S. Constitution. Yet this decentralized system ultimately gave corporations room to grow. Without strong federal control, states competed to attract businesses by loosening incorporation requirements. New York led with the first general incorporation law for manufacturers in 1811, with other states soon following and expanding the scope of the law. The vast, unexploited North American landmass and push for industrialization made the corporate structure increasingly attractive, further aided by America’s quicker and widespread adoption of limited liability and lighter state oversight compared to Europe. While state legislatures tried to regulate corporations with rules on capitalization, voting rights, and director terms, these measures proved mostly ineffective. Corporations amassed enormous influence, with “company towns” illustrating their growing control over local economies and governance. Corporate imperialism returned under an American banner, with the United Fruit Company, which controlled enormous banana plantations in Central America and used its political influence to overthrow governments. These towns still exist in some shape or form today. “The original coal and textile towns in America are now largely ghostly, but places like Hershey and Corning, New York, which were invigorated by the Corning glass company, are still going strong. Plus, as the LA Times writes, businesses such as Google and Facebook today are providing housing, amenities, and transportation for their workers—meaning that while we think of company towns in sepia tones, they’re also in digital blue,” statesSmithsonian magazine. In The Visible Hand, Alfred D. Chandler Jr. suggests that the dominance of American corporations by the 20th century was due to their managerial hierarchies rather than entrepreneurs, which provided them with stability, coordination, and centralized planning. This is partly supported in The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea, which argues that robber barons were replaced by “the faceless manager” and the multidivisional firm. By the 1930s, legal scholar Adolf A. Berle and economist Gardiner C. Means, whose work shaped modern corporate governance theory, warned that dispersed shareholders had lost control to entrenched managers and called for reforms in corporate oversight. The 1919 Dodge v. Ford case had already enshrined shareholder primacy in U.S. law, declaring that directors must prioritize shareholder profits. But rather than democratizing ownership, the rise of institutional investors, like pension and mutual funds, and other financial giants, further concentrated power among select shareholders. By the end of the 20th century, globalization offered American corporations, as well as others, a platform to dominate beyond natural borders. The American corporate model became the ruling template in a worldwide ecosystem, largely controlled by shareholder interests and executive compensation tied to quarterly earnings pressures. The Growing Power of Corporations Over time, corporations have become the dominant business entities. Despite only representing 18 percent of U.S. businesses, corporations generate nearly 82 percent of all revenues. Around 20,000 large corporations employ as many people as the 31.7 million small businesses, according to the 2024 data provided by payment processor company Clearly Payments. Many of them now function as monopolies or organized cartels. In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, the Supreme Court affirmed that corporations have First Amendment rights, including the right to “use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.” Borderless by design, major corporations drive a race to the bottom for cheap international labor and pass sustainability costs onto consumers. Countries often lack the strength to rein them in, and where they can, corporations simply exploit tax havens and flexible jurisdictions. As economist Lynn A. Stout observed, outdated yet profitable business practices like shareholder primacy are hard to shake. Accountability and sustainability appear largely ignored, with corporations long prioritizing profit over public safety. Asbestos manufacturers suppressed evidence of its deadly health effects to keep selling their products. Tobacco firms knowingly misled the public about cancer risks for decades.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, used its LLC status and shell corporations to dodge accountability for the opioid crisis. According to an Associated Press investigation, “the Sacklers’ wealth is shielded in a web of companies and trusts, some registered in offshore tax havens far from Purdue’s Connecticut headquarters,” states a 2019 article by CBS News. Calls for corporate responsibility have grown as the power of corporations has increased. The corporate social responsibility movement began with philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and resurged in the 1970s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, ESG and stakeholder activism sought to revive this initiative, but became politicized and have waned, even as corporate influence continues to grow. As “universal owners” of the economy, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street control vast shares and command corporate influence. While it was hoped their broad holdings would make them stewards of the economy, short-term thinking and weak oversight continue to limit meaningful action like prioritizing long-term sustainability, fair labor practices, and avoiding hoarding wealth. Corporations are wielding new tools of dominance through AI and digital technologies. “Companies such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, Koch Industries, Maersk, Siemens, and Unilever are using AI tools to swiftly find and engage with alternative suppliers during unexpected disruptions. They are also employing AI tools to pre-qualify suppliers ahead of time. These AI tools provide buyers with enhanced information that allows them to beat their competitors in securing alternate sources of supplies,” points out a Harvard Business Review 2023 article. They can also deflect accountability through PR campaigns, obscure controversies through complex supply chains and legal structures, and offload responsibility to subsidiaries, contractors, or consumers. Combined with the growing use of private military and security contractors, some modern corporations operating in unstable or contested regions are regaining a degree of coercive power reminiscent of the colonial-era trading giants. The core problem is that while we retain some voice in the political system, that influence doesn’t extend to massive corporate structures. “Voting with our wallets” offers little power when essential services are dominated by a handful of interconnected firms. Reform While the corporate model dominates, alternatives continue to evolve. In early 20th-century China, corporate law was weakly enforced, and corporations were uncommon. Today, China exerts control over both state-owned and private corporations, embedding Chinese Communist Party officials into corporate governance. This hybrid model places corporate activity under tighter oversight, supported in part by nationwide social credit scores for all companies. President Teddy Roosevelt promoted trust-busting as the solution to corporate abuse by big business, but as economist Lawrence Mitchell notes, the prior era of fierce competition among smaller companies was also disastrous. He identified the real problem of states competing for corporate charters in a “race to the bottom,” a danger that Justice Louis Brandeis also noted in 1933. Roosevelt even acknowledged in 1902 that only the federal government could properly regulate interstate corporations, which Mitchell supports. So, how should governments regulate monopolies? Some countries have taken a more open approach to consolidation. The German government, for example, legalized collusion and cartel formation to control prices and output in ways that serve national interests, actively encouraging the attempted merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank since 2019. Cooperatives offer another path. The first successful cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was founded in 1844 in the UK, championing democratic control, open membership, and profit-sharing. In Spain, the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker-owned cooperatives founded in 1956, has become the “leading business project in the Basque Country and one of the largest corporations in Spain.” Rather than lay off workers, Mondragon often reallocates them across its network. New reformist approaches are also emerging in Europe. France’s 2019 PACTE Act allows companies to define a social purpose beyond profit, embedding missions into corporate charters and expanding employee influence in mergers and executive oversight. Economist Mariana Mazzucato has promoted this mission-driven model as part of her vision for innovation-led governance. In the U.S., Delaware’s recent legislative push is part of a broader effort challenging shareholder primacy, notably since the 2019 Business Roundtable, where top CEOs pledged to serve all stakeholders. Delaware and other American states already allow businesses to register as benefit corporations (B-corps), balancing profits with goals like environmental protection or community development. Existing corporations can convert by amending their founding documents. CHS Inc., a major agricultural cooperative ranked 115th on the Forbes 500 list in 2025, meanwhile, demonstrates how cooperative principles still have traction in the country. It has emerged as one of the “largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the world.” Digital finance is also leading to experimentation in how businesses are owned and operated. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, are blockchain-based communities with decentralized governance that make decisions by vote. Aiming for transparency and shared control, they face clear hurdles. Unclear legal status has slowed adoption, while security flaws, including a major 2016 breach, have seen millions stolen due to a code exploit. Governance challengesinclude low participation, power centralization, and slow decision-making. “In some high-profile DAOs, the majority of governance tokens are often held by the founders and early investors, which can skew decision outcomes in favor of their interests rather than the broader community,” states a blog by Colony, a platform providing a framework for DAOs. Not all innovation prioritizes the public good. The “Network State” concept, coined by tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, envisions venture-backed private cities, colonies, and zones across the U.S., Latin America, Africa, and beyond. These digital-first enclaves aim for diplomatic recognition and eventual sovereignty through special economic zones, framing private microstates as expressions of libertarian freedom. Efforts to reduce shareholder power can also backfire by merely concentrating power in the hands of corporate managers rather than all stakeholders. Elon Musk is a clear example; by retaining large ownership stakes, employing dual-class shares, and keeping firms like X, Tesla, and SpaceX private or under holding structures, he has shielded himself from shareholder influence while consolidating control. The planned incorporation of Starbase, Texas, a township effectively governed by SpaceX, demonstrates how this management style can dovetail with Network State ambitions. Born in the Dutch Republic, matured in England, and transformed by the United States, the march of the modern corporation has proven remarkably resilient over the centuries. Hudson’s Bay Company, founded in 1670 as an English trading giant like the EIC, once controlled vast swaths of North America and now exists as a retail chain. Corporate power in general, however, continues to expand. After early overreach by the VOC and EIC prompted containment efforts, corporations have resurged through globalization, financialization, and advances in technology. Short-term profit maximization is seen as natural, with structures geared away from wider stakeholder responsibility. Many firms resist direct governance to escape the negative optics of being seen as too powerful, which would bring more scrutiny and accountability. Yet some corporations have grown so large that they have become pillars of modern society and carry significant responsibility, even if they do not openly acknowledge it. Without altering their growing influence, the future will be shaped less by democratic will through established channels and more by concentrated, private authority. ‘So, how should governments regulate monopolies?’ I’m sure that the Chinese have a few good ideas. If any of their billionaires get out of line and start muscling in on the government (cough*Jack Ma*cough), they tend to go missing. Sometimes they turn back up again. Sometimes they don’t. In reading this article, I was struck how he insisted that corporations must aim for ‘longevity’. But in one of John Michael Greer’s novels – “Retrotopia” – he mentioned that it was not always so. That for example a corporation might be set up to build a road, it would raise the funds needed, it would then use those funds to have the road built, set aside money for maintenance, and would then dissolve itself after having completed the purpose that it was set up for. That sounded so strange the first time I read that. Some of it may depend on the type of corporation. A couple of examples from the entertainment and real estate areas. in the entertainment industry it is not uncommon for there to be a production company formed strictly for the production of one movie or television show. Because of the way it is financed or distributed it is hard to tell when you look at the credits. (As they are involved in distribution it does allow for some leeway in getting satisfaction if there is a problem.) The real estate part I know of is that it is not unheard of for the bigger company to form a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) to actually construct a building. After the building is built the LLC “sells” the building but it is always done that they continue to hold all responsibilities for the construction, but that is just for show as it ceases to exist. “Blankfein went ahead anyhow.” Sounds like Llyod could serve in any number of ‘representative’ elected offices. Interesting reading the background to the idea corporations have to but shareholders first. It always bugged me for two reasons. I mean General Electric couldn’t decide ro day that they were going to start importing and selling heroin as they thought it would give a better return to shareholders. Clearly they still have to follow the laws of the land of face the consequences. And secondly, even if it was the case that it was a legal requirement, so what? It’s nit a law of nature or of physics. It could only ever be a law of man and those can be changed. As I recall, some conservatives advocate that corporations should violate laws if the profits ensuing from violating the laws are larger than the associated penalty. Maybe this is a calculation done by citizens as well, so corporations would be following Citizens United into people hood. A country could enforce laws and set the penalties for law violation high enough to discourage societal harmful behaviors. But the USA seems to have harsh justice for little people with a policy of “friends don’t let friends do time” for the rich and connected. I never go over the Ford pardon of Nixon as the pardon was justified as healing to the nation and Nixon had “suffered enough”. . In an it will never happen desire, I desperately want there to be minimum fines attached to overcharging or embezzling the government. I recognize that the system has been gamed enough that they don’t even have to pay back the government (see the special master throwing out the DOJ case against United Health for overcharging Medicare by 2 billion dollars), but in my world not only would it be incumbent on United Health for proving that the various supposed treatments occurred and that the charges were accurate for those treatments. And if they weren’t they would be required to pay back the full amount plus an additional 50% of that amount just to keep their C suite executives out of jail. There should be no return on investment for deceiving customers and employees. AND bankruptcy law should be rewritten to have owner corporation continue to be on the stick for any lawsuits or liabilities from fraud or malfeasance of fully owned subsidiaries rather than allowing that to die with the bankruptcy of said subsidiary. Whenever I hear of a corporation skating in some manner, I remember that beacon of Republican responsibility prosecuting minor crimes in NY left and right (homeless people washing windshields, minor drug offenses, etc) because that was going to increase overall adherence to the law. I always compared it to the trickle down theory as in all profits go to the top and all penalties go to the bottom. It’s not really talked about much outside of law journals but all of the British colonies in America were set up as corporate entities, not just the Virginia Company. If you read the charters of each of them, it’s truly not far off from corporate organization documents of today. The legacy of this structure remains and it seems very anachronistic but I guess it’s all we got. +1 on the reform path of Cooperatives. Just change the bylaws of a corporation to one member = one share/vote, you bring in democracy and accountability of the management to the workers. And I know this may sound crazy, but if, in the same spirit and reasoning chattel slavery was made illegal, we could do the same to human rental (i.e. wage system), all corporations with employees would effectively have to become Worker-Cooperatives. Instead of Capital renting humans, Humans would rent capital, which makes much more sense. It’s a great path towards democracy….. The venerable Hudson’s Bay Company shuttered its last retail store just a few months ago. The end of an era. Fond memories of their iconic point blankets and clothing. I bought one of the point blankets a couple of years ago as a sort of nostalgic, ironic hat tip to the early days of Canadian colonization, well aware as I am of the horrors that came with it. They were not made in Canada — Yorkshire, I think. I have no love for the Weston family but they just bought the original HBC charter and are donating it to a museum. https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/the-mix/not-meant-to-be-manitoba-museum-reflects-as-bay-charter-heads-elsewhere-11049467 HBC was Canada’s East India Company, another example of colonialism at its worst. Very fine intro, Yves. A corporate charter was at one time simply a grant by the sovereign of limited liability to protect investors from being dragged underwater by a failing business concern. An investor might lose their share value in a business failure but their other assets were protected. This promoted investment in enterprises which benefitted the polity as a whole by building necessary infrastructure and providing employment. Under today’s system of Inverted Totalitarianism the corporations control the sovereign state through massive infusions of campaign cash while looting infrastructure and destroying employment in order to enrich corporate executives and officers encouraged by stock “incentive” compensation to game short-term performance through looting. Self-dealing executives and officers becoming major shareholders created an enormous conflict of interest. The “Last have become the First” negating the entire social justification for a sovereign grant of corporate status. All of which was proceeded by an ideology cut from/cobbled together and funded by Capital from bastardized theology aka TINA/Powell memo thingy … Thank you, Yves, for this article and the fine commentary. It’s indeed frustrating to see the zombie shareholder primacy myth making rounds, raising again from the dead to eat our brains. That’s specially true when the author even cites Lynn Stout, arguably the most important scholar to debunk this myth. But there’s one point I wanted to ask you for further thoughts, if you’d be kind enough to bear with me. I always thought that it was part of the plan for the ETF managers of the world (particularly BlackRock) to wield greater influence over big corporations. They certainly make loads of money with ETF on their own right, but when you index something like S&P500, you’re making sure you have the right stocks, i.e. of the corporations that actually matter right now. Ditto for oil, tech, whatever. It makes it much easier to coordinate a strategy among them. The common assumption is that Blackrock, Vanguard etc. are sitting on their hands with that much power on their hands. Although you’re right that they won’t sell the shares as a form of pressure, they can still vote as shareholders. Not selling their shares makes their threat more worrisome in this case. BlackRock became more notorious because it tried to do the old Whig/Democrat/liberal/”woke” thing of pretending to care about ESG etc. and, after this is accepted and normalized, legitimately exert its own illegitimate control for its own purposes. As the article noticed, the worst kind of push-back materialized (the Tory/Republican/”conservative” one); instead of pretending to care, we won’t even pretend anymore and outright burn anyone suggesting that we care about the environment, society, workers, consumers… Unfortunately, most of the evidence I have is my tin foil hat and the eternal lust for power of these groups. But you really think that the voting rights they get from significant proportions of shares in big companies is siting idle? I also don’t think I understood the 401(k) argument. Is it that corporations choose these institutional investors for managing the pension funds? Thanks for bearing with me! No, they will always vote with management (save extremely bad governance abuses) because they want the 401(k) business, which has vastly higher margins than running index funds. Tons of fees and grifting via how they handle trades by plan participants in and out of funds. Also the margins on index funds are too thin to support any kind of corporate lobbying. You actually have to have a reasoned position on important proxy issues. That takes staff. Indexers compete on the tightness of their index replication and having the lowest fees possible. Any extra expenses undermine competitiveness. A finer epitaph I know not … The link to the 1919 Dodge v. Ford case was interesting. Yves, great intro! The pep talks we got from upper management about “shareholder values” always made more sense when one substituted “my bonus”. And once all my co-workers saw how they were implementing these “shareholder values”, we realized that had morphed into “bone us”. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Does the Stock Market Know Something We Don’t?

The uncomfortable fact about its historic run is that no one is sure why it’s happening—or what could bring it to an end. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here. Can anything stop the stock market? The U.S. economy recently weathered the worst pandemic in 100 years, the worst inflation in 40 years, and the highest interest rates in 20 years. Yet from 2019 through 2024, the S&P 500 grew by an average of nearly 20 percent a year, about double its historical average rate. Despite President Donald Trump’s erratic economic policies, which include the highest tariffs since the 19th century, the market is already up by about 8 percent in 2025. As the stock market soars ever higher, the theories of why it rises have suffered the opposite fate. One by one, every favored explanation of what could be going on has been undermined by world events. The uncomfortable fact about the historic stock-market run is that no one really knows why it’s happening—or what could bring it to an end. According to textbook economics, the stock market’s value reflects what are known as “fundamentals.” An individual company’s current stock price is derived from that firm’s future-earnings potential, and is thus rooted in hard indicators such as profits and market share. The value of the market as a whole, in turn, tends to rise and fall with the state of the broader economy. According to the fundamentals theory, the market can experience the occasional speculative bubble, but reality will bite soon enough. Investors will inevitably realize that their stocks are overvalued and respond by selling them, lowering prices back to a level that tracks more closely with the value justified by their fundamentals—hence the term market correction. The fundamentals story held up well until the 2008 financial crisis. Within six months of the U.S. banking system’s collapse, the market fell by 46 percent. In response, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero and pushed money back into the economy by purchasing trillions of dollars in securities from financial institutions. The Fed’s goal was to get the economy going again quickly. This didn’t happen. For most of the 2010s, corporate earnings were modest, GDP and productivity growth were low, and the labor market remained weaker than it had been before the crisis. In other words, the fundamentals were not great. Yet the stock market soared. From 2010 to 2019, it tripled in value. Rogé Karma: The Federal Reserve’s little secret This gave rise to what became known as the “liquidity” theory of the market. In this telling, the force driving the ups and downs of markets was the Federal Reserve. As long as the central bank was willing to keep flooding the financial system with cash, that money would eventually find its way into the stock market, causing valuations to rise regardless of what was happening in the real economy. The apotheosis of the liquidity theory came in early 2020: The stock market crashed when the coronavirus pandemic hit, and the Fed once again responded by turning on the money taps. By mid-summer, unemployment was still above 10 percent, but the stock market had already rebounded past its pre-pandemic peak. But the liquidity theory’s run was short-lived. In 2022, as inflation replaced unemployment as the economy’s biggest problem, the central bank reversed course, quickly raising interest rates and selling its securities. As the liquidity theory would predict, the stock market took a nosedive, falling by close to 20 percent. Then something strange happened. The Fed continued to raise interest rates over the course of 2023, to their highest levels in two decades, and kept them there in 2024. It also drained about $2 trillion of liquidity from the financial system. Yet the market took off once again. The S&P 500 rose by nearly 25 percent in both 2023 and 2024, making it the market’s best two-year run of the 21st century. “Between 2008 and 2022, the view on Wall Street was we were experiencing a liquidity-driven market,” Mohamed El-Erian, an economist and the former CEO of the asset-management firm PIMCO, told me. “That wasn’t at all the case in ’23 and ’24.” The stock market’s performance in those years was unusual for another reason. More than half of the S&P 500’s total growth in 2023 and 2024 was driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia. During those two years alone, Tesla’s value rose by 286 percent, Meta’s by 355 percent, and Nvidia’s by 861 percent. The biggest firms have always been responsible for a disproportionate share of the market’s growth, but never had the gains been so acutely concentrated. The phenomenon couldn’t be explained solely by superior business performance; the Magnificent Seven’s stock prices had begun to exceed earnings by record amounts, implying that their valuations had more to do with expectations about future growth. This gave rise to a new theory: The stock market was being supercharged by the coming AI revolution—or, at least, by belief in it. The Magnificent Seven’s extreme surge began in early 2023, shortly after the release of ChatGPT, which kicked off a wave of interest and investment in the AI sector. The seven companies seem especially well positioned to prosper from the emerging technology, either because they provide crucial inputs to the development of AI models (Nvidia), are investing heavily in building their own models (Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet), or stand to benefit significantly from automation (Amazon, Tesla, Apple). To some experts, the situation has all the markings of a speculative bubble. In a recent blog post, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at the asset-management firm Apollo, pointed out that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued—meaning their stock prices exceed their earnings by larger factors—than the top 10 companies at the height of the 1990s dot-com bubble were. Take Nvidia, the chipmaker that recently became the first company in history to hit a $4 trillion valuation. Historically, the average price-to-earnings ratio for a company in the U.S. market has been about 18 to 1, which means that to buy a share of stock, investors are willing to pay $18 for every $1 of the company’s yearly earnings. Nvidia’s current price-to-earnings ratio is 57 to 1. AI boosters argue that these valuations are justified by the technology’s transformative potential; skeptics respond that the technology is far from being adopted at scale and, even if it eventually is, that there’s no guarantee that these seven specific companies will be the ones to rake in the profits. “We’ve seen this story play out before,” Jim Bianco, an investment analyst, told me, pointing to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. “Just because there’s a truly revolutionary technology doesn’t mean stocks are correctly pricing in that reality.” If the current market froth is indeed an AI bubble, then a day must come when the bubble bursts. For a moment, that day appeared to have arrived on April 2, when Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Over the next week, the stock market fell by 12 percent, and the Magnificent Seven took even steeper hits. But then, on April 9, Trump backed down from his most extreme tariff proposals and, a few weeks after that, de-escalated what seemed like an imminent trade war with China. The market swiftly recovered and launched into a bonanza even wilder than those of the previous two years. The S&P 500 has risen nearly 30 percent since its post–Liberation Day low, setting all-time records, and the Magnificent Seven have come roaring back. This gave rise to the concept of the “TACO trade,” as in “Trump always chickens out.” The idea is that Trump hates falling stock prices and will back off from any proposal that puts the market in jeopardy. So rather than sell their stocks every time the president threatens to impose crippling trade restrictions, investors should continue to pour money into the market, confident that the proposals Trump ultimately leaves in place won’t do much damage. The flaw in the TACO theory is that Trump hasn’t completely chickened out. Tariffs are the highest they’ve been in more than a century, and the president is announcing new ones all the time. Still, the market appears largely unfazed. When Trump announced “trade deals” with the European Union and Japan that set the tariff on most goods arriving from those places at 15 percent, the stock market actually rose. Even last week, when the president announced a sweeping new set of global tariffs—an announcement immediately followed by a brutal jobs report suggesting that tariffs were weakening the economy—the market suffered only a blip. As of this writing, it is higher than it was before the announcement. This leaves a final theory, one that has nothing to do with Trump, AI, or the Federal Reserve. Thirty years ago, almost all of the money in the U.S. mutual-fund market was actively managed. Retirees or pension funds handed over their savings to brokers who invested that money in specific stocks, trying to beat the market on behalf of their clients. But thanks to a series of regulatory changes in the late 2000s and early 2010s, about half of fund assets are now held in “passive funds.” Most retirees hand their savings over to companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, which automatically invest the money in a predetermined bundle of stocks for much lower fees than active managers would charge. The most common type of passive fund purchases a tiny share of every single stock in an index, such as the S&P 500, proportional to its size. Annie Lowrey: Could index funds be “worse than Marxism”? Some experts believe that this shift is the best explanation for the otherwise inexplicably resilient performance of the stock market. “The move to passive funds is a radical shift in the structure of financial markets,” Mike Green, the chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, told me. “To think that wouldn’t dramatically impact how those markets behave is just silly.” Active investors are highly sensitive to company fundamentals and broader economic conditions. They pore over earnings reports, scrutinize company finances, and analyze market trends, and will often sell at the first sign of an economic downturn or poor company performance, which causes markets to “correct.” Passive investors, on the other hand, typically just pick a fund or two when they set up their retirement accounts and then forget about them, meaning they are automatically buying stocks (and rarely selling), no matter what. In June 2020, for example, Vanguard released a statement bragging that fewer than 1 percent of its 401(k) clients had tried to sell any of their equities from January to the end of April, even as the economy was melting down. Thus, whereas a market dominated by active investors tends to be characterized by “mean reversion”—in which high valuations are followed by a correction—a market dominated by passive investors is instead characterized by “mean expansion,” in which high valuations are followed by even higher valuations. “When there’s a constant flow of passive money coming in, betting against the market is like standing in front of a steamroller,” Green said. “You’d be crazy to do it.” A market dominated by passive investors also naturally becomes more concentrated. Active investors tend to avoid larger stocks that they believe might be overvalued, but the opposite is true for passive investors. Because they allocate funds based on the existing size of companies, they end up buying a disproportionate share of the biggest stocks, causing the value of those stocks to rise even more, and so on. The explosion of passive funds over the past 15 years could explain why the market has become less sensitive to real-world downturns, more likely to keep going up no matter what, and dominated by a handful of giant companies. Or that theory could end up being disproved by unforeseen events. It wouldn’t be the first. Support for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

Title: Ethereum Is 10 Years Old As The SEC Chair Heralds DeFi As The Future Of Finance

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. On July 30, 2025, Ethereum celebrated 10 years since its launch, marking a new milestone in crypto history. With a decade-long record of uninterrupted uptime, it has laid the foundations for DeFi and an era of open public digital networks that serve all of society. In the past decade, Ethereum has traversed uncharted territory, from a unique fundraising strategy called the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014, raising $18.3 million, to hosting Blackrock’s first public onchain money market fund last year - you’ve come a long way baby. Regulatory clarity in the American economy now plays a big role in Ethereum’s future. Since the SEC’s massive crackdown on ICOs in 2018, accusing them of violating securities laws, the agency has itself come a long way in the past few months in under a new chair. Recently, SEC chair, Paul Atkins, gave a speech on “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution”. In the speech, he highlighted Trump’s Executive Order to make America the “crypto capital of the world” and that the “DNA of the DeFi movement embodies American ideals like economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation.” Atkins explicitly stated that the right to self-custody digital assets is a "core American value," emphasizing the importance of individuals having control over their own property, and announced the kick off of Project Crypto aimed at modernizing SEC custody rules to accommodate crypto assets, including exploring exemptive relief and potential rule changes to allow market participants to operate efficiently. The SEC is considering an "innovation exemption" to protect DeFi projects from overly restrictive regulations, allowing them to operate within a more flexible framework. Atkins defended developers of self-custody wallets and DeFi applications, stating that they shouldn't be held liable for how users utilize their software, comparing it to holding car manufacturers responsible for traffic accidents. He also highlighted the resilience of self-executing, on-chain systems, particularly in contrast to centralized platforms and stressed the need for regulatory clarity regarding core crypto activities like staking and mining, stating that they should not be automatically classified as securities. The SEC issued a clarification this week that properly structured liquid‑staking protocols and their receipt tokens generally do not constitute securities under U.S. law. Happy 10th Birthday Ethereum, the SEC has honored you by giving the DeFi ecosystem the best gift ever – regulatory clarity that supports DeFi as the future for financial services, and you are the DeFi market leader - a worthy award for the groundbreaking innovation you have brought us. On this momentous occasion, let’s look back at how Ethereum built the underlying architecture for dapps as it is positioned to play a central role in daily interactions and enterprise systems in the financial services sector in decade to come. Ethereum draws its strength from a strong developer community that emphasizes strengthening the network’s infrastructure. Trevor Koverko, co-Founder of Polymath and Sapien, commented, “For a decade, Ethereum has paved the way for tech founders to tinker with their ideas and build something meaningful. "Take the example of the ERC-20 token standard. It transformed the idea of token launches and brought uniformity in value transfers without worrying about liquidity fragmentation across different blockchains. "The 2017-18 ICO boom did lead to the growth of scam tokens, but that’s negligible collateral damage. Scammers gave serious projects the incentives and confidence to build something that delivered real value on a secure and decentralized network like Ethereum. “Ever since, builders have doubled down on token standards, with the introduction of ERC-721 for NFTs, ERC-1155 to combine fungible and non-fungible attributes, ERC-1400 for compliant security tokens, and many others.” Ethereum has, however, had its share of dark days. In 2016, the Ethereum DAO suffered a $60 million exploit, leading to a permanent split of the blockchain. The new chain after the hard fork reversed the network to the moment before the theft and continued as Ethereum, while the older one is now called Ethereum Classic. As Qi Wu, co-Founder of PLVR, explained, “From the DAO fork to hundreds of exploits, Ethereum paid the price early. But those lessons created the best developer tooling, auditing practices, and frameworks in the space. Today, building on Ethereum is safer, smarter, and more robust than ever.” Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither was Ethereum - It took its time to gain the confidence of its well-knit community of developers and users to build a robust network. Elaborating on Ethereum’s trust-building exercise, Alexander Cutler, co-founder of Aerodrome, a DEX on Base, said, “Entering a trustless global system, ironically, requires trustworthiness. And Ethereum has earned it over the past 10 years by consistently leading the way with uncompromising infrastructure built to last the next 100 years.” No one thought Ethereum would become such a time-tested and reliable backbone of onchain interactions. Isidoros Passadis, head of staking and core contributor at Lido, noted, “Ten years ago, Ethereum was just a bold experiment. Today, it supports billions in economic activity and is reshaping finance, governance, and coordination worldwide.” Echoing that sentiment, Michael Huynh, co-founder of DCentral Conference, said, “Ethereum is no longer an experiment. It’s now a pillar of the crypto industry. From an idea ten years ago to a thriving ecosystem with thousands of companies innovating the future of tech — it has transcended the speculative norms to redefine technologies that were once just mere theories.” With the end of the first decade, the age of experimentation at Ethereum is over. The next decade is about iteration and doubling down on its strengths to lead research and development in the digital assets space. Billy Luedtke, ceo and founder of Intuition, remarked, “After ten years of head-down engineering, Ethereum’s infrastructure has quietly crossed a threshold: it’s now sturdy enough for mainnet, mission-critical workloads. "Advancements such as rollups, data availability layers, account abstraction, and staking — ideas that were truly no more mature than prototypes a few years ago — have hardened into audited production systems. We can finally retire the “test in prod” meme and start migrating the world’s first financial system onto the credibly neutral rails of Ethereum. "Crucially, the network effects that matter most — security, developer mindshare, and tooling — have only deepened. Competing chains still sell “faster and cheaper”, yet Ethereum’s roadmap (verkle trees, danksharding, recursive L3s) points to near-infinite scalability without sacrificing decentralization.” As Ethereum matures and sets a target for the next decade, its strength lies in advancing crypto’s core strength of decentralized internet - Web3 - architecture. There’s a reason why Ether (ETH) is the OG altcoin, next only to bitcoin, in terms of market cap and popularity. Wu explains, “Ethereum is still the most used chain because it’s where developers go first, where trust is highest, liquidity deepest, and infrastructure most mature. L1 remains the secure backbone, while L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base deliver scalability. "This layered design, shaped by a community committed to credible neutrality and decentralization, attracts the best builders and drives Ethereum’s continued leadership in developer activity, app composability, and settlement value.” It is Ethereum’s commitment to the blockchain’s primary principles that makes it a winner. Cutler says, “Ethereum hasn’t sacrificed the security or neutrality of its infrastructure, even though it had immense pressures to do so in exchange for greater adoption, profits, and market share. This is why, as the world comes onchain, Ethereum is the only credible infrastructure that has the track record and consistent practices to support its adoption at scale.” On a similar vein, Passadis adds, “As Ethereum moves into its second decade, more institutions and individuals are seeing the value of its decentralization and neutrality. This growing interest gives us a genuine opportunity to reinforce these core principles actively. By thoughtfully welcoming new participants, we can make sure Ethereum stays resilient, inclusive, and truly open to everyone. "Ethereum’s strength has always come from collective participation. If we carefully align future growth with the values that got us here, the next decade will firmly establish Ethereum as the trusted and neutral foundation for the global economy.” The institutional demand is evident from the market data. ETH ETFs have recorded massive monthly inflows of $5.4 billion in July, as Ethereum celebrated its 10th anniversary. Since June, crypto treasury firms have also acquired more than 1% of ETH’s circulating supply, outpacing Bitcoin treasury funds. Luedtke explained, “The market has noticed. Institutions like BlackRock have turned ETH from a “venture bet” into an allocation-worthy treasury asset, giving institutions a compliance-ready onramp to staking yield and onchain participation. "Meanwhile, Robinhood has begun issuing tokenized U.S. equities on an Ethereum-based L2, offering its European users 24/7 trading and instant settlement — an early glimpse of Wall Street’s operating system in the cloud. For the first time, the buy-side is dragging the sell-side (and the regulators) towards on-chain infrastructure rather than waiting for banks to lead.” Huynh observed, “Ethereum’s future is still untold. As newer companies from every sector build on the blockchain and start experimenting, the more we’ll see newer tools emerging. RWAs, decentralized treasuries, stocks, ETFs, loans, NFTs, games, AI — all these sectors are beginning to emerge, and I believe they would multiply demand drastically.” Luedtke says, “We’re still only in inning one. An infinite roadmap — including stateless clients, unified liquidity across rollups, and richer data-and-identity layers — remains on deck for the infinite garden of Ethereum. "Ethereum’s real promise is bigger than finance: it is an open, programmable trust layer for society — exactly the kind of substrate we’ll need to prevent AI-era power structures from ossifying behind black box algorithms and closed APIs, ensuring through code that no one person or group has too much power.” The next decade of Ethereum’s journey will be about further developing the plumbing – the backend infrastructure - and solving real problems with innovative onchain products, without compromising on decentralization and security. It sounds rather boring, but it is this steady hand on the tiller and commitment to quality scaling and network growth that is the backbone of the digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) game, and is the not-so-secret sauce that wins support from developers and financial institutions alike. And let’s not forget the SEC’s role in accelerating the growth and adoption of DeFi into the next decade. Here’s to the next 10 years of Ethereum – the OG that started the DeFi movement – may the force be with you.

Title: How AMD Stock Falls To $80
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/07/how-amd-stock-falls-to-80/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD) has had a strong run this year so far, rising nearly 35% since early January, driven by recovering CPU demand and investor enthusiasm around generative AI. But with the stock now trading at a lofty 42x forward earnings, investors may want to pause and ask: how much of this valuation is justified, and how much is riding on high expectations? Here’s the thing, a 50% drawdown from current levels would not be unprecedented. It happened in 2022, when AMD stock lost over 60% of its value in just a few quarters. With the stock now around $163, a return to $80 levels isn’t out of the question. And after a mixed Q2 earnings report and mounting macroeconomic pressures - including tariffs under President Donald Trump - a reality check may be in order. See our counter scenario on AMD Stock upside to $330. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that AMD is a pretty volatile stock. Valuation Rests on AI Hope. But Are Things Going To Plan? A key driver of AMD's premium valuation is its potential in the AI chip space. However, Q2 revenues from the company’s data center division, which houses its AI accelerator business, fell short of expectations with revenue rising just 14% to $3.2 billion. What's worse - AI chip sales appear to have declined year-over-year, held back by export restrictions to China and a pause as customers await the next-gen Instinct MI350. Compare this with Nvidia, which reported over 70% growth in its data center business to $39 billion last quarter. AMD’s AI efforts remain a distant second, and it may be missing out on a significant chunk of the capital pouring into generative AI infrastructure. Should you buy or fear AMD stock? For perspective, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet together spent roughly $222 billion in capex in 2024, projected to surge to $360 billion in 2025. AMD's inability to capture a larger share of that spend raises concerns about whether its AI narrative can continue to support such a high multiple. There are some positives as well. The Trump administration recently eased restrictions on AMD’s MI308 chip shipments to China, which could provide a near-term revenue boost. However, Nvidia’s entrenched position - bolstered by its proprietary CUDA software ecosystem - makes customer switching harder and limits AMD’s upside. AI Spending Sustainability, Competition There are also broader risks to the AI story. Despite massive infrastructure spending, most companies have yet to figure out compelling monetization models for AI. Shareholder pressure could eventually mount to improve returns, and this could cause tech giants may slow their GPU spending. Meanwhile, many of the big tech companies are building their own custom AI chips. Google has its TPUs, Microsoft is rolling out Maia, Amazon has Trainium and Inferentia, and Meta is building in-house silicon optimized for its own AI workloads. These in-house efforts could reduce dependency on AMD (and Nvidia), and could meaningfully reduce their addressable market. Even if the GPU story stumbles, could AMD fall back on CPUs? Not without challenges. AMD’s bread-and-butter PC and server CPU businesses could face pressure as the U.S. economy softens. Inflation remains elevated, job growth is moderating, and President Trump’s new tariffs on key trading partners risk driving up costs, dampening consumer spending and business investment alike. That could impact PC sales and in turn hit CPU revenues. How resilient is AMD stock during a downturn? AMD stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard AMD Dropped 6.4% In A Day. Have You Fully Evaluated The Risk? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Inflation Shock (2022) • AMD stock fell 65.4% from a high of $161.91 on 29 November 2021 to $55.94 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 January 2024 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and currently trades at around $163. Covid Pandemic (2020) • AMD stock fell 34.3% from a high of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 22 July 2020 Global Financial Crisis (2008) • AMD stock fell 91.2% from a high of $20.35 on 1 January 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 21 August 2018 Premium Valuation In summary, it also doesn’t help that AMD stock is still expensive; it trades at almost 49x trailing earnings and 42x forward earnings. Sure, Advanced Micro Devices' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years, rising at an average rate of about 15% over the last 3 years (vs. 5% for S&P 500). However, this growth could fade quickly if the economy takes a turn for the worse and if the company fails to meaningfully capture share of the AI chip market. At current multiples, even modest disappointments could trigger an outsized correction in the stock. The rich valuation of AMD stock limits its upside potential in the near-to-mid term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

The Partnership will host a call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the results and business outlook. Details for accessing the call can be found below under "Earnings Webcast & Conference Call." Financial Highlights The Partnership reported the following results as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2025: The difference between reported net income and CAD is primarily due to the treatment of provisions for credit losses and unrealized losses on the Partnership’s interest rate derivative positions. A reconciliation of net income to CAD is included below under “Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures - Cash Available for Distribution.” In June 2025, the Partnership announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone AF Manager LLC declared a regular quarterly distribution to the Partnership's BUC holders of $0.30 per BUC. The distribution was paid on July 31, 2025, to BUC holders of record as of the close of trading on June 30, 2025. Management Remarks “We continue to focus our investing activity on lending associated with low income housing tax credit projects,” said Kenneth C. Rogozinski, the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer. “In the second quarter, we extended the maturity date for both of our corporate credit lines and increased our total borrowing capacity by $30 million. In July, we received an additional capital commitment of approximately $60 million for the BlackRock construction lending joint venture from a second institutional investor. Both of these developments make us well positioned to deploy capital into new affordable housing investment opportunities.” Recent Investment and Financing Activity The Partnership reported the following updates for the second quarter of 2025: Investment Portfolio Updates The Partnership announced the following updates regarding its investment portfolio: Earnings Webcast & Conference Call The Partnership will host a conference call for investors on Thursday, August 7, 2025 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Partnership’s Second Quarter 2025 results.

About Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP was formed in 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the primary purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, seniors and student housing properties. The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis. The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership seeks to achieve its investment growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by its Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, dated December 5, 2022 (the “Partnership Agreement”), taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.

Similarly, statements that describe objectives, plans, or goals also are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Partnership. The Partnership cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, implied, or projected by such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: defaults on the mortgage loans securing our mortgage revenue bonds and governmental issuer loans; the competitive environment in which the Partnership operates; risks associated with investing in multifamily, student, senior citizen residential properties and commercial properties; general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions, including the current and future impact of changing interest rates, inflation, and international conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East) on business operations, employment, and financial conditions; uncertain conditions within the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, including monetary and fiscal policy and conditions in the investment, credit, interest rate, and derivatives markets; any effects on our business resulting from new U.S. domestic or foreign governmental trade measures, including but not limited to tariffs, import and export controls, foreign exchange intervention accomplished to offset the effects of trade policy or in response to currency volatility, and other restrictions on free trade; adverse reactions in U.S. financial markets related to actions of foreign central banks or the economic performance of foreign economies, including in particular China, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom; the general condition of the real estate markets in the regions in which the Partnership operates, which may be unfavorably impacted by pressures in the commercial real estate sector, incrementally higher unemployment rates, persistent elevated inflation levels, and other factors; changes in interest rates and credit spreads, as well as the success of any hedging strategies the Partnership may undertake in relation to such changes, and the effect such changes may have on the relative spreads between the yield on investments and cost of financing; the potential for inflationary impacts resulting from macroeconomic conditions and policy initiatives; the Partnership’s ability to access debt and equity capital to finance its assets; current maturities of the Partnership’s financing arrangements and the Partnership’s ability to renew or refinance such financing arrangements; local, regional, national and international economic and credit market conditions; recapture of previously issued Low Income Housing Tax Credits in accordance with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; geographic concentration of properties related to investments held by the Partnership; changes in the U.S. corporate tax code and other government regulations affecting the Partnership’s business; risks related to the development and use of artificial intelligence; and the other risks detailed in the Partnership’s SEC filings (including but not limited to, the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K). Readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. If any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or if any of the assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements proves to be incorrect, the developments and future events concerning the Partnership set forth in this press release may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our expectations and beliefs to change. The Partnership assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless obligated to do so under the federal securities laws. * The amounts indicated above have been adjusted to reflect the distribution completed on April 30, 2024 in the form of additional BUCs at a ratio of 0.00417 BUCs for each BUC outstanding as of March 28, 2024 on a retroactive basis. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures - Cash Available for Distribution The Partnership believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership’s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses or income consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments, provisions for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit), and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also adjusts net income for the Partnership’s share of (earnings) losses of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the Market Rate Joint Venture Investments segment as such amounts are primarily depreciation expenses and development costs that are expected to be recovered upon an exit event. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 22 to the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and distributions and accretion for the Preferred Units. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership’s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership’s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership’s net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to CAD) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 (all per BUC amounts are presented giving effect to the distributions in form of additional BUCs on a retroactive basis for all periods presented): (1) The adjustments reflect the change in allowances for credit losses under the CECL standard which requires the Partnership to update estimates of expected credit losses for its investment portfolio at each reporting date. Credit losses are not reported within CAD until such loses are realized. The provision for credit loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 includes asset-specific provisions for credit losses for affordable multifamily investments totaling approximately $9.3 million. In connection with the final settlement of the bankruptcy estate of the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB in July 2024, the Partnership recovered approximately $169,000 of its previously recognized allowance credit loss which is not included as an adjustment to net income in the calculation of CAD for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. (2) As described in Note 22 to the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the limited partners and BUC holders, as a class, and 25% to the General Partner. This adjustment represents 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner. Tier 2 income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 related to the gain on sale of Vantage at Helotes and the premium received upon redemption of the Companion at Thornhill Apartments MRB. There was no Tier 2 income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. (3) The Partnership determined there was a recovery of previously recognized impairment recorded for the Live 929 Apartments Series 2022A MRB prior to the adoption of the CECL standard effective January 1, 2023. The Partnership is accreting the recovery of prior credit loss for this MRB into investment income over the term of the MRB consistent with applicable guidance. The accretion of recovery of value, net of adjustments, is presented as a reduction to current CAD as the original provision for credit loss was an addback for CAD calculation purposes in the period recognized. (4) The Partnership declared the distribution completed on April 30, 2024 in the form of additional BUCs equal to $0.07 per BUC for outstanding BUCs as of the record date of March 28, 2024.

Title: BlackRock Dumps Ethereum, Over $375M in a Single Day – Is the ETH Price Set to Fall?

Ethereum price is facing some challenges after BlackRock, one of the biggest asset management firms, sold over $375 million worth of Ethereum in just one day. This move has made some investors nervous, wondering if the Ethereum price will drop even more. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), a fast-growing cryptocurrency, has been seeing impressive gains, already up more than 500% in 2025. Source: TradingView On August 5, blockchain data showed that BlackRock moved 101,975 Ethereum into Coinbase Prime, worth about $372 million. This caused some uncertainty in the market, with Ethereum price falling to around $3,611, a 1.4% drop on the day and almost 5% down for the week. In addition to this, Ethereum ETFs faced big outflows of around $600 million, though some of that was later recovered. Currently, Ethereum price is facing strong resistance near $3.10. If it can’t break through, it could face more declines. The price is also stuck in a symmetrical triangle pattern on the chart, which often signals a major price move is coming. If Ethereum fails to hold above $3,583, it may drop further. While Ethereum price is struggling, Remittix (RTX) is quietly building momentum. Remittix has raised over $18.2 million through the sale of 583 million tokens, each priced at $0.0895. This new crypto payment platform is quickly becoming popular because of its focus on low-fee, fast, and secure crypto payments across 30+ countries. Here are some reasons why Remittix could outperform other cryptos like Ethereum in the future: With its potential uses in business and individuals, Remittix will remain in the spotlight as its user base increases. Compared to Ethereum, which is yet to gain acceptance in the marketplace, Remittix is gaining traction and has a chance to turn the crypto payments industry upside down. As Ethereum price struggles with resistance and declines in the market, Remittix is an excellent long-term investment. With real-world applications in the payment sector, Remittix offers consistent growth and has a much clearer path forward compared to the volatility of speculative assets like Ethereum. As Remittix continues to develop, it could become one of the best crypto investments for the future.

At 72 weeks, all three doses of orforglipron, met the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints compared to placebo, delivering clinically meaningful weight loss as an adjunct to a healthy diet and physical activity. For the primary endpoint, orforglipron 36 mg, taken once per day without food and water restrictions, lowered weight by an average of 12.4% (27.3 lbs) compared to 0.9% (2.2 lbs) with placebo using the efficacy estimand.1 "Obesity is one of the most pressing global health challenges of our time, driving global chronic disease burden and impacting more than one billion people worldwide," said Kenneth Custer, Ph.D., executive vice president and president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health. "With orforglipron, we're working to transform obesity care by introducing a potential once-daily oral therapy that could support early intervention and long-term disease management, while offering a convenient alternative to injectable treatments. With these positive data in hand, we are now planning to submit orforglipron for regulatory review by year-end and are prepared for a global launch to address this urgent public health need." In the ATTAIN-1 trial, orforglipron met the primary endpoint of superior body weight reduction compared to placebo. Participants taking the highest dose of orforglipron lost an average of 27.3 lbs (12.4%) at 72 weeks using the efficacy estimand. In a key secondary endpoint, 59.6% of participants taking the highest dose of orforglipron lost at least 10% of their body weight, while 39.6% lost at least 15% of their body weight. In addition to achieving significant weight loss, orforglipron was also associated with reductions in known markers of cardiovascular risk, including non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and systolic blood pressure in pooled analyses across all doses. In a pre-specified exploratory analysis, the highest dose of orforglipron reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels by 47.7%. Efficacy Estimand Results Orforglipron 6 mg Orforglipron 12 mg Orforglipron 36 mg Placebo Primary Endpoint Mean percent change in body weight from avg.baseline of 103.2 kg(227.5 lbs) and 37.0 BMIi -7.8% (-8.0 kg; -17.6 lbs) -9.3% (-9.4 kg; -20.7 lbs) -12.4% (-12.4 kg; -27.3 lbs) -0.9% (-1.0 kg; -2.2 lbs) Key Secondary Endpoints Percentage of participants achievingbody weight reductionsof ≥10%i 35.9 % 45.1 % 59.6 % 8.6 % Percentage of participants achieving body weight reductionsof ≥15%i 16.5 % 24.0 % 39.6 % 3.6 % iSuperiority test was adjusted for multiplicity. For the treatment-regimen estimand,2 each dose of orforglipron led to statistically significant improvements across the primary and all key secondary endpoints. The overall safety profile of orforglipron in ATTAIN-1 was consistent with the established GLP-1 receptor agonist class. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild-to-moderate in severity. The most common adverse events for participants treated with orforglipron (6 mg, 12 mg and 36 mg, respectively) were nausea (28.9%, 35.9% and 33.7%) vs. 10.4% with placebo, constipation (21.7%, 29.8% and 25.4%) vs. 9.3% with placebo, diarrhea (21.0%, 22.8% and 23.1%) vs. 9.6% with placebo, vomiting (13.0%, 21.4% and 24.0%) vs. 3.5% with placebo, and dyspepsia (13.0%, 16.2% and 14.1%) vs. 5.0% with placebo. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 5.1% (6 mg), 7.7% (12 mg) and 10.3% (36 mg) for orforglipron vs. 2.6% with placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 21.9% (6 mg), 22.5% (12 mg) and 24.4% (36 mg) for orforglipron vs. 29.9% with placebo. No hepatic safety signal was observed. The detailed ATTAIN-1 results will be presented next month at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting 2025 and published in a peer-reviewed journal. More results from the ATTAIN Phase 3 clinical trial program will be shared later this year, along with findings from the ACHIEVE Phase 3 clinical trial program evaluating orforglipron for adults with type 2 diabetes. About orforglipron Orforglipron (or-for-GLIP-ron) is an investigational, once-daily small molecule (non-peptide) oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that can be taken any time of the day without restrictions on food and water intake.3 Orforglipron was discovered by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and licensed by Lilly in 2018. Chugai and Lilly published the preclinical pharmacology data of this molecule together.4 Lilly is running Phase 3 studies on orforglipron for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical problem. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension in adults with obesity. About ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN clinical trial program ATTAIN-1 (NCT05869903) is a Phase 3, 72-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of orforglipron 6 mg, 12 mg and 36 mg as monotherapy to placebo in adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one of the following comorbidities: hypertension, dyslipidemia, OSA or cardiovascular disease, who did not have diabetes. The trial randomized 3,127 participants across the U.S., Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, Spain and Taiwan in 3:3:3:4 ratio to receive either 6 mg, 12 mg or 36 mg orforglipron or placebo. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that orforglipron (6 mg, 12 mg, 36 mg) is superior to placebo in body weight reduction from baseline after 72 weeks in people with a BMI ≥30.0 kg/m² or a BMI ≥27.0 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity and a history of at least one self-reported unsuccessful dietary effort to lose body weight. All participants in the orforglipron treatment arms started the study at a dose of orforglipron 1 mg once-daily and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 6 mg (via steps at 1 mg and 3 mg), 12 mg (via steps at 1 mg, 3 mg and 6 mg) or 36 mg (via steps at 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg and 24 mg). Dose reduction was only allowed for GI tolerability if other mitigations failed. The ATTAIN Phase 3 global clinical development program for orforglipron has enrolled more than 4,500 people with obesity or overweight across two global registration trials. The program began in 2023 with additional results anticipated this year. About LillyLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

Title: Apple just got a big win in Trump’s tariff war. It may have bigger concerns | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Apple CEO Tim Cook should be breathing a sigh of relief. The White House on Wednesday ratcheted tariffs on Indian imports up by an additional 25%, raising the total levies on one of the United States’ most crucial trading partners to 50% when they kick in later this month. But smartphones are exempt from President Donald Trump’s new levies on India, marking a crucial win for the tech giant as it approaches its most important time of the year: its annual September iPhone launch followed by the holiday season. Apple will also dodge incoming new tariffs on semiconductors, since it’s committed to building iPhone components in the United States, Trump said Wednesday. That’s not to say tariffs won’t hurt; CEO Tim Cook said tariffs will likely cost the company $1.1 billion this quarter. But analysts say Apple has bigger concerns, such as its future product strategy and approach to artificial intelligence, a burgeoning field that the tech behemoth is perceived to be behind in. Under different circumstances, such high tariffs could have spelled trouble for Apple. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, making up the majority of its revenue. Most iPhones sold in America come from India. And the Americas, which includes the United States, is Apple’s largest market. “In terms of the longer-term issues, more than a year out, I would say tariffs are probably 20% of it,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, who has covered Apple for decades. “I think what’s going on the regulatory environments (is) probably 25%, and 55 is related to how they’re going to capitalize on AI.” Tariffs are a challenge for Apple, but one that analysts seem confident the company can manage. A combination of Apple’s diversified supply chain – which it partially shifted to areas like India and Vietnam around five years ago to reduce reliance on China during COVID – along with its high margins and Cook’s operations expertise put the company in a strong position. Supply chain resilience is “supposed to allow you to adjust tactically to any major changes that comes unexpected,” said Runar Bjørhovde, a research analyst for market research firm Canalys. That held true even before Apple committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the United States to manufacture iPhone parts domestically on Wednesday. While moves like these don’t directly impact tariff policy, they do likely help Apple curry favor with the administration, especially as Trump has pressed Apple to build its iPhones domestically. “Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple is coming back to America.” Some analysts already expected that the iPhone would be exempt from the upcoming levies on India ahead of Wednesday’s tariff announcement. But the back-and-forth tariff policies, which have changed multiple times throughout the year, make it challenging to predict what could happen in the future. “Because (smartphones are) such an important category, the relationship that Apple has with both administrations, and specifically, even the US administration, we do think that they will be able to maneuver against this threat,” said Nabila Popal, senior director with the International Data Corporation’s data and analytics team. “But it is important, of course. It does present a risk.” That said, analysts largely believe India and China are Apple’s only two options for producing US-bound iPhones at scale. And since iPhone models available in the United States don’t precisely match those sold elsewhere, Apple can’t just redirect iPhones intended for different markets. New iPhones sold in America, for example, don’t have physical SIM card slots anymore, and they support millimeter wave 5G, the kind of connection that provides faster, low-latency speeds but usually only at a short distance. “It’s a massive tactical nightmare to deal with,” said Bjørhovde. “Because you have to try and find a sweet spot and figure out what comes next.” Cook said iPhones will continue to be assembled outside of the United States for “a while” during an event at the Oval Office announcing the new $100 billion investment on Wednesday. But he pointed to the company’s strategy of instead producing iPhone components stateside. “Well, if you look at the bulk of it, we’re doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we’re doing the glass here, we’re doing the Face ID module here, and so there’s a ton of it, and we’re doing these for products sold elsewhere in the world,” Cook said. “And so there’s a lot of content in there from United States.” The narrative that Apple is behind in AI has been looming over the company all year – and some analysts see it as a more challenging issue to overcome than tariffs. Apple delayed a high-profile upgrade to its Siri assistant that would have enabled it to provide more personalized answers and act across apps, bringing it up to speed with the agent-like capabilities that Google and OpenAI are pursuing with their digital helpers. And the company’s rivals are still using that setback as ammunition to promote their own products over Apple’s. Just this week, Google posted an ad for its upcoming Pixel 10 phone that said: “If you buy a new phone because of a feature that’s coming soon, but it’s been coming soon for a full year, you could change your definition of soon.” Apple’s initial batch of AI features also didn’t launch in time for the iPhone 16’s arrival last September. At the same time, many of Apple’s peers are seeing booming returns from their AI investments. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both hit $4 trillion in market capitalization in July, a milestone Wall Street previously thought Apple (AAPL) might reach first. That’s partially because of their fundamentally different products and business models. Apple is a consumer hardware company. In contrast, Microsoft, Meta (META) and Nvidia also provide the tools that businesses rely on to support AI-powered services and features, like cloud computing, chips and AI models. Still, Apple saw stellar earnings results for the June quarter, surpassing expectations for iPhone sales – including in China – and overall revenue. But during Apple’s earnings call, analysts pressed Cook about his perspective on AI and what it means for the company’s products. Those questions ranged from whether AI services might be eating into search engine usage, whether the forthcoming Siri upgrade could drive future new products and whether Apple would consider acquiring AI companies to further its product roadmap. “Taking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,” Cook said in his opening remarks during the earnings call. “We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.” But Apple can’t risk falling too far behind when it comes to the iPhone’s AI capabilities. By doing so, it could create an opportunity for Samsung, Google and Qualcomm – the three of which dominate the Android phone space – to pull ahead, says Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. “What’s more important with investors is, after the iPhone 17, what do they really do?” he said. “I mean, as far as generative AI and AI functionality, that that’s the real focus on Apple right now.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: The stock market still has a $7 trillion secret weapon that could boost gains into year-end

Investors might be sitting on a secret weapon that could send stocks soaring. That's according to Wall Street strategists, who say that a big reason to be bullish on stocks in the near term is the record $7 trillion in cash investors have stored in money markets fund. That money — sidelined in assets like US Treasurys, money market mutual funds, and other short-term, highly-liquid debt instruments — could eventually make its way back into equities. That would be a huge boom for stocks, according to Savita Subramanian, the head of US equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America. "We've still got a lot of cash, still got a lot of fixed income on the plate," Subramanian said, speaking to CNBC on Wednesday, speculating that money could make its way into equities once the Fed resumes its rate-cutting cycle. Central bankers trimmed rates twice in late 2024, but have held off on a third rate cut as they assess the impact of tariffs on inflation. But investors have ramped up bets for rate cuts after a weak July jobs report last Friday, betting that the Fed will cut rates at its September meeting. Markets are pricing in a 95.1% chance the Fed could issue a 25-basis-point rate cut at its next policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The return on cash and bonds is also "not great," Subramanian added, another reason investors could eventually plough cash back into the stock market. Others have also touted the potential boost from record amounts of cash coming off the sidelines. Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat, said it is one reason he remains optimistic on equities in a note last month. Lee, known as permabull bull on Wall Street, said he still sees the S&P 500 reaching 6,600 by the end of the year, implying around 4% upside from current levels. "The bull market has proven itself intact," he wrote, referring to the benchmark index's record-breaking rally in recent months. Kristy Akullian, the head of iShares investment strategy in the Americas at BlackRock, also referenced the large amount of cash in money market funds recently. "A portion of those funds could be poised to come off the sidelines if investors — like us — anticipate rate cuts without an accompanying recession," she wrote. Jump to

Title: What CFOs say about AI when they’re speaking off the record

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Everyone is talking about AI. Earlier this week, we hosted a dinner with 17 CFOs from some of the world’s largest companies, where they talked about how they’re using AI in their jobs. Some are using it to highlight how different words are likely to impact sentiment on earnings calls, based on historical data. Many use it to create scenarios around earnings projections against the vagaries of tariffs, policy shifts, technology investments and more. They’re creating hyper-personalized data sets and go-to-market strategies that not only use AI agents but tailor interactions to customers’ AI agents. I also learned about their strategies for embedding AI knowledge throughout their organizations, from top-down learning to metrics for getting promoted into the senior ranks. And while most are not yet cutting jobs in response to AI, they’re also not adding to their overall headcount. The dinner, sponsored by Deloitte and ServiceNow, was conducted under the Chatham House rule to encourage conversation by sharing highlights anonymously. But during my on-the-record chat with economist Rebecca Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, we heard about the impact of a shift in fiscal policy. “It’s not just the fact that Congress ignored the Congressional Budget Office and historical norms in enacting the reconciliation bill,” she noted. “It’s also the size of the increase to future deficits at a time when the economy has been growing above its long-term potential. I thought we would see some fiscal hawks push back more and water down the ultimate bill, or that there would be a longer fight. I was wrong.” Patterson also said she expects policies under the Trump Administration to “lean towards” structurally higher inflation. And she talked about the continued strength of the U.S. relative to other economies and the transformative impact of AI. Insights from leaders on the front lines are critical in shaping the themes of this column and underscore the unique role that Fortune plays in convening and creating connections. Next up is Brainstorm Tech, which Andrew Nusca will lead on Sept. 8 to 10 in Park City, Utah. One Strategy Group CEO David Meadvin told me yesterday that “there’s nowhere better for genuine relationship building.” I believe him. I’ll be going there to moderate some conversations and cohost a dinner for CEO Initiative members with Qualtrics CEO Zig Serafin. If you’d like to join us at Brainstorm Tech, you can apply here. Trump’s tariffs are now in effect Americans must now pay steep taxes if they want to import from countries like Syria (41%), Laos and Myanmar (40%) or Switzerland (39%). Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter failed to change the White House’s mind over the last few days and it remains unclear why Switzerland was singled out for such a harsh rate. Quote of the day: “We are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,” Chad Bown, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told the FT. 100% tariff on semiconductor chips The president said he would double the price of imported computer chips but not for companies that are “building in the United States.” Few other details are available. Apple pledges $600 billion U.S. investment In an amazing coincidence, the iPhone maker yesterday said it would add $100 billion to its existing domestic “manufacturing” commitments and add 20,000 jobs to its payroll. Apple stock was up 4% on the news. Palantir’s rise, explained Palantir’s blowout earnings on Tuesday capped a 555% year-over-year stock surge, raising the defense-tech company’s market cap to over $400 billion. Here’s how the Alex Karp-led company became one of the 25 most valuable companies in the world. AI will destroy jobs, ex-Google exec says Google X’s former chief business officer Mo Gawdat says the notion AI will create jobs is “100% crap,” and even warns that “incompetent CEOs” are on the chopping block. The tech guru predicts that AGI will be better at everything than most humans. Only the best workers in their fields will keep their jobs “for a while,” and even “evil” government leaders might be replaced by the robots, he said. Microsoft raids Google’s AI ranks Mustafa Suleyman, one of the founders of Google’s DeepMind, who is now head of Microsoft AI, is raiding his old company for talent, calling them personally on the phone with the promise that life at Microsoft has more of a startup vibe than Google does. He has poached two dozen Googlers with compensation that far exceed those paid at DeepMind. Trump favors meeting with Putin to end Ukraine war The president told European leaders and U.S. reporters yesterday that he was open to meeting Putin soon to get a ceasefire in Ukraine. But he also sounded sceptical about Putin’s motives, saying he had “been disappointed before with this one.” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump was “open to meeting with both President Putin and President Zelensky” and “wants this brutal war to end.” Disney earnings and NFL deal Disney posted solid earnings on Wednesday, just a day after announcing that Disney’s ESPN sports network is acquiring major NFL media assets in exchange for a 10% equity stake in ESPN. The company raised its full-year guidance for fiscal 2025 and now believes it will finish the year with an 18% year-over-year gain in adjusted earnings. S&P 500 futures were up 0.48% this morning, premarket, after the index closed up 0.73% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.5% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.33% in early trading.

Despite its fair share of ups and downs, 2025 has shaped up to be a banger year for crypto. Both market giants like $BTC and $ETH, and low-cap wildcards like $PENGU and $TROLL, have been painting the charts green, racking up good gains for early investors. Looking ahead, the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Big institutions are gobbling up $BTC and $ETH like it’s a Black Friday sale. Crypto ETFs are widely expected to get the green light by Q3 according to James Seyffart. And mainstream adoption continues to surge thanks to improving regulation and scalability breakthroughs. So, to help you unearth high-potential tokens, we turned to ChatGPT, the world’s most popular (and arguably most powerful) AI chatbot. Thanks to its ability to analyze massive troves of on-chain data, market sentiment, social trends, and real-time developments, GPT is surprisingly capable of spotting high-potential cryptos before the herd catches on. Sure, that was in stocks, but it proves the AI’s ability to crunch numbers and make smart picks in volatile markets. So, keep reading to discover ChatGPT’s top picks for the best crypto to buy right now, complete with insights into what makes these projects noteworthy. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). By adding Solana-style capabilities and bridging to the Bitcoin Layer 1, Hyper delivers ultra-fast transactions, low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem – all while maintaining the network’s top-tier security. Given Bitcoin’s lofty price predictions – Standard Chartered says it could hit $200K by year-end – ChatGPT picking a Bitcoin-themed token as the best altcoin to buy now isn’t all that surprising. So, how does it work? A decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge will let you interact with the SVM-powered Web3 environment on Hyper’s Layer-2. The bridge mints an equivalent wrapped amount of your native $BTC on the Bitcoin Hyper network, ready for use on various side-chain platforms and dApps. These ‘wrapped’ tokens are fully compatible with the Layer 2 and can be used for: All without having to put up with Bitcoin’s painfully slow speeds. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is progressing faster than Usain Bolt; it has already raised $7.4M+, with several whale purchases ($74.9K, $54.1K, $37.9K, and $19.6K) in past three months alone. As for the upside, $HYPER could surge up to 2,449% and hit $0.32 by the end of 2025. Right now, you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for a low price $0.01255. Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers Best Wallet, a free crypto wallet that solves the most common issues associated with crypto on-boarding – confusing tech and stressful secret key management. Best Wallet is not just easy to use, though. It’s also versatile, which perfectly positions it to benefit from the rapidly growing global crypto wallet market, which is expected to reach $57.61B by 2029 at a CAGR of 31.9%. Security-wise, this wallet is non-custodial and relies on Multi-Party Computation to secure private keys. In plain English, you won’t have to worry about data leaks or hacks. Your wallet’s secret key is split between your device and a private server, never being fully revealed to any external source. It’s also very intuitive. You can go from making your first wallet to swapping tokens across top blockchains within minutes. Holding the $BEST token also gives you lower fees. One of Best Wallet’s features worth mentioning is its Presale Aggregator, which lets you buy the best crypto presales directly from within the app. This sets a new benchmark for convenience in the wallet industry, as you don’t have to visit any external presale sites. Buying $BEST right now (at just $0.025445 per token) will give you early access to this presale aggregator, plus governance rights and generous staking rewards (currently 93% APY). The project has in total raised over $14.5M in early investor funding, with a new price increase due in 12 hours. Now’s a good time to buy $BEST if you want to support the project. Visit Best Wallet Token’s official website. The biggest hub of meme coins, Solana ($SOL), is currently riding both fundamental and technical tailwinds that could push it beyond the $200 mark – and possibly even $300 – by the time Santa Claus comes down through your chimney. One of the biggest reasons to remain bullish on $SOL is the overwhelming likelihood of a spot Solana ETF being approved by the SEC in the third quarter. According to Bloomberg, the chances now stand at a staggering 95%. Such approval could significantly increase retail participation, driving up both trading volume and demand. Things look positive from a technical analysis perspective, too. After bouncing off a key support zone, $SOL has now pulled back to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. This is considered a strong bullish signal because it’s often seen as the ‘golden pocket’ where asset prices tend to find support before continuing their upward trend. Interestingly, the support zone in question is the same one that triggered a ~100% rally back in October-November 2024. If a similar move plays out this time, $SOL could climb to around $250 in the current rally alone. The token is currently trading around $169, up 13% over the past month. The best part is that you can readily find Solana on Binance and other top crypto exchanges. Overall, ChatGPT’s list of recommendations included a fantastic blend of low-cap presale gems, like $HYPER and $BEST, and established, proven performers like $SOL. So, you can create a well-rounded portfolio for yourself for August and beyond. That said, this article is not financial advice. Remember that crypto is volatile.

Title: A laid-off Accenture manager has been job hunting for 21 months. Recruiters keep telling him he's too expensive.

Full Content:
Alexander Valen thought his more than two decades of experience in the tech industry would help him find a job, but he said it sometimes feels like a disadvantage. In November 2023, Valen was laid off from his project manager role at the consulting firm Accenture, where he said he managed up to 150 developers, architects, and software testers, depending on the project. Over the past 21 months, Valen said he's had more than two dozen interviews but hasn't been able to land a job. He and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, have relied on DoorDash earnings, unemployment benefits, and family support. But it hasn't been enough, and Valen said they've fallen behind on their mortgage payments. "More recently, it's just dead — I don't hear anything," Valen, who's 51 and lives in Florida, said of his job applications. "It's like a black hole, and I don't know what's going on." In recent months, Valen said even landing interviews has become challenging. The end of his Accenture tenure and his conversations with recruiters have led him to draw one conclusion: It's a particularly tough job market for workers with a lot of experience and corresponding pay expectations. "The first thing recruiters say when they see my profile is it's very expensive," he said. Valen's experience reflects a broader shift in the US labor market that's made it more difficult for workers in managerial positions to find jobs. Several corporations, including Microsoft, Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart, have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. And it's not just big businesses. Gusto, a small and midsize payroll and benefits platform, found that manager firings and layoffs have risen 66% between January 2022 and September 2024 for those ages 45 to 54 — and more than 400% for those ages 35 to 44. This trend, dubbed the Great Flattening, reflects a broader push to reduce costs and bureaucracy, moves business leaders say will make their organizations more efficient. But for some laid-off managers, finding new employment has been far from easy. Amid economic uncertainty, ranging from tariffs to the early impacts of AI adoption, US businesses are hiring at nearly the slowest pace in more than a decade. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of Americans over the past year who are struggling to find work as US businesses slow hiring and flatten management structures. Share your story by filling out this quick form and read more below: Throughout his final year on the job, Valen said he noticed a shift: clients were requesting lower-cost workers, and he spent as long as two months "on the bench," meaning that he wasn't assigned to any client projects. Since being laid off, Valen's pay level has continued to feel like a barrier. His Accenture role paid about $87 an hour, and he said he's targeted roles that pay between roughly $65 and $85 an hour or roughly $135,000 to $177,000 annually. But in the current hiring landscape, some recruiters have told him that his compensation level is too steep for their clients. It's left Valen struggling to find openings where there's demand for someone with his experience and salary expectations. "I applied for one job and they're like, 'We're going to have to pay you $35 an hour.' That's really, really low." Valen said he decided to stay in the running for the role but didn't get an interview. While he's willing to stray a bit from his target compensation range, he said he doesn't want to go below $50 an hour — about $104,000 annually. Over the last few months, Valen said his job search has been particularly frustrating. When he manages to find a job posting that seems like a good fit, there are often already hundreds of applicants, making his chances of landing the role feel slim. Valen said recruiters he's connected with have told him they get up to hundreds of LinkedIn connection requests a day, and that it's become difficult to figure out which candidates to prioritize. AI tools are partially to blame, as they make it easier for job seekers to apply to more roles than ever, and perhaps even help some people misrepresent their skills and qualifications. In response to his job search challenges, Valen said he's expanded his search beyond project manager positions to business analyst and sales roles — even applying for a kitchen team member role at Chick-fil-A, though it didn't lead to an interview. He's also tried to build his AI knowledge through experimentation with various tools, though he's unsure how much of an edge this will give him over other candidates. If he could give advice to other struggling job seekers, he'd tell them not to give up and to look for opportunities to improve their skills while looking for work. But as his search drags on, he said it sometimes feels like no advice makes much of a difference. "It's a crazy market," he said. "I don't know what to do right now." Jump to

Bitcoin held above $114,500 as institutional inflows returned, lifting sentiment and technical momentum. Ethereum and altcoins also gained. Analysts cited strong liquidity zones, ETF inflows, and macro factors supporting long-term bullishness, despite short-term resistance and volatility. Consolidation may precede a breakout if key levels are crossed in the near term.

Title: A founder said her $200 million newsletter empire had over a million subscribers. Her own records tell a different story.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/daniella-pierson-newsette-subscription-numbers-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-07T04:28:30Z
Full Content:
Daniella Pierson is a proponent of faking it till you make it. The 30-year-old founder of The Newsette Media Group, known for its daily newsletter about style and pop culture, says it's been key to her trajectory: a $9 million SoHo apartment, a net worth reported to be $220 million, and mentors like Serena Williams and Diane von Furstenberg. "I faked it till I made it," she told a Stanford Business School audience in 2024, recalling that she pretended to be an intern when her company was a one-woman affair to drum up interest and used made-up names when communicating with partners. A Business Insider investigation into Pierson's enterprise reveals that pretending to be her own intern may not have been her only distortion of reality. A review of internal documents and dashboards, recordings of meetings, and interviews with more than 10 company insiders uncovered questions about what Pierson has told the public and advertisers about her business when compared with what her own records show — including how many subscribers her newsletter has. A spokesperson for Pierson confirmed to Business Insider that The Newsette's daily newsletter goes out to about 500,000 subscribers each day. That's less than half the 1.3 million subscribers claimed in a 2025 pitch deck to advertisers and the million-plus referenced by Pierson in multiple public appearances. The spokesperson said that the larger figure reflects the company's overall email list, which includes what they described as "disengaged subscribers" who have been "funneled out" of the daily newsletter by a quality control mechanism. In a statement sent to Business Insider and posted on Instagram, Pierson called criticism of her business a "smear campaign," and said claims involve "false statements and fabricated information" meant to hamper her ability to continue supporting women through her companies. "They messed with the wrong person," she wrote. Pierson has touted The Newsette Media Group's 2021 revenue — $40 million, according to both Pierson and former employees — in public appearances as recently as last year. She's never publicly revealed revenue figures for subsequent years. Company documents seen by Business Insider paint a less rosy picture for last year: The company's 2024 revenue goal was $5 million. The Pierson spokesperson said this number was not accurate but declined to provide further information. They added that the company is currently profitable. Part of the revenue decline can be attributed to the 2023 shuttering of Newland, the creative agency that Pierson launched in late 2020 as part of The Newsette Media Group. She said Newland drove more revenue than the newsletter business itself in 2021. The Newsette Media Group now employs eight people, down from 40 at its peak, the Pierson spokesperson said. Pierson's business, by multiple measures, has fallen from its heights. It's a problem she's familiar with. In a 2024 TEDx Talk, Pierson spoke about "all of the billionaire guys" who had raised capital and whose companies were now "worth zero." "People don't realize, you have $1 billion on paper, that paper can burn real fast," she said. Over the past decade, Pierson has perfected her founder narrative. An identical twin, Pierson struggled in school and was labeled, in her own telling, "the dumb twin." When she got to Boston University, she said in multiple podcast interviews, she floundered in school, uninspired by learning about the Earth's crust and how to properly measure the area of a triangle. She decided to focus on what she did like — magazines — and founded The Newsette as a newsletter during her sophomore year at the age of 19. Every morning, she'd wake up at 5 a.m. and spend five hours drafting a newsletter for her subscribers. During class, she DM-ed people on Facebook, telling them that if they brought on new subscribers, they could add "Newsette ambassador" to their résumés. "When I started in 2015, there weren't any newsletters out there," she'd later tell the audience at Stanford. (Prominent launches of newsletters with a similar flair included The Skimm in 2012 and Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop in 2008.) Once she graduated and had hammered out the product details, she couldn't find investors. Instead, she took a $15,000 loan from her parents. She's said she has since repaid the loan and has posted on Instagram that she "made her mom a millionaire" by giving her a stake in Newsette Media Group. Without venture backing, she had to be profitable right away, she said, so she began selling ads, making $25,000 in her first month of accepting advertisers in 2017. Pierson was successful in attracting press attention, at first from small college-targeted outlets and her hometown station, later from outlets including Elle, WWD, and Business Insider. The interviews were peppered with her catch-phrases: The Newsette was a "gift in your inbox," she often said, and at the beginning, she had three employees, "me, myself, and I." In 2019, a meeting with von Furstenberg, whom Pierson calls her fairy godmother, resulted in a partnership with the fashion designer: a publication called the Weekly Wrap, which Pierson said on the "Money Rehab" podcast was one of her big breaks. In early December 2019, she appeared on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, saying The Newsette had grown to 500,000 subscribers. Revenue, Pierson said in a number of interviews, shot from $1 million in 2019 to $7 million in 2020 to $40 million — $10 million of it profit — in 2021. She said that revenue and the company's 500,000-plus subscribers allowed her to sell a 1.25% stake in the company at a $200 million valuation. The Pierson spokesperson declined to say who the investor was. Based on The Newsette Media Group's valuation and her stake in Wondermind, a mental-health startup she had cofounded with Selena Gomez and Gomez's mom, Forbes reported she was worth $220 million in August 2022. That made her the youngest, wealthiest self-made BIPOC woman in America, according to the magazine, a title she repeats with gusto. An examination of company documents shows a growing gap between the subscriber numbers Pierson gave publicly and what was on the books. On August 10, 2022, the day the Forbes story came out touting more than half a million subscribers, The Newsette had 411,000, according to documentation reviewed by Business Insider. In a 2023 interview with Forbes, she said it was on track to reach 1 million subscribers by the end of the year. According to company documentation, The Newsette had no more than 570,000 subscribers that year. At the 2024 Stanford talk, she said she had hit the 1 million mark; the records say The Newsette had fallen below 500,000. She repeated those numbers to advertisers. A pitch deck used earlier this year claims that The Newsette has "1.3 million+ subscribers" who receive its weekday, Saturday, and Sunday editions. A spokesperson for Pierson told Business Insider that there are 1.2 million emails in the company's total contact list — including people who no longer receive the newsletter regularly — and said the daily edition currently goes out to about 500,000 active subscribers. Jacob Donnelly, the founder of A Media Operator, a newsletter-based publication for people building digital media companies, said that standard industry practice is that the number of subscriptions refers to the number of people who receive the newsletter. "If I were to go out and say I have 1.3 million subscribers, what I'm saying to the advertiser is when I hit send, it's going out to 1.3 million people," he said, speaking generally and not about The Newsette specifically. "If someone is not subscribed to a product, I don't see how they could be classified as a subscriber." In a meeting with a potential advertiser earlier this year, a recording of which Business Insider reviewed, Pierson mentioned a subscriber count of "a million" and boasted that "every single day, our sponsors get at least 250,000 unique views." In the more than two years of newsletter data that Business Insider reviewed, The Newsette's newsletter only hit that many unique opens one time. More than half of the days, it had fewer than 200,000. At the end of 2020, von Furstenberg personally pitched Pierson to Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Pierson previously told Business Insider. The tech giant soon became one of the first clients of Newland, a creative agency that became, for a short time, The Newsette Media Group's cash cow. In 2021 and into 2022, Newland completed a number of projects for Amazon; Pierson told the Stanford audience that the company "was responsible for tens of millions of dollars in revenue." The agency took a 360-degree approach to social media marketing, coming up with the brief, hiring the talent, and handling the paid media. Campaigns included a viral Prime Day TikTok push featuring Snoop Dogg and a number of creators, and content for Women's History Month with Keke Palmer, Mindy Kaling, and von Furstenberg. According to two former employees familiar with the financials, the $40 million revenue figure Pierson touted represented gross revenue, or all of the money that flowed through the company, inclusive of cash reserved for talent and paid media. Most publicly owned ad agencies report net revenue — the money left over once a campaign is finished — and not gross revenue, which includes money the agency gets to pay for things like celebrity endorsements. When Amazon underwent a reorganization toward the end of 2022 and into 2023, the company largely paused its new work with Newland, according to four former employees. Amazon declined to comment to Business Insider about its business with Newland. After Amazon's departure, Pierson struggled to bring new clients to the agency, said four former employees. Newland, Pierson said, grew to eventually employ the majority of Newsette Media Group's employees. In December 2022, Newsette conducted one of several rounds of layoffs. Former employees said the layoffs were due to a cash crunch. By the end of 2023, Newland had completely folded. The Pierson spokesperson said the job cuts were not due to a "financial crunch," but were made for the sake of "efficiencies." For 2024, the company's revenue goal was a modest $5 million, according to internal documents. The Pierson spokesperson said those numbers were not accurate, but declined to provide additional numbers or documentation. In addition to Newsette Media Group, Pierson has been involved in other ventures. In 2021, she was announced as the co-CEO of Wondermind, a mental health website that she cofounded with Selena Gomez and the singer's mother, Mandy Teefey. In 2023, she quietly left the company; the circumstances of her departure have not been disclosed. After a press release about Pierson's investment in a group attempting to purchase Forbes went out, she posted on X that she was "on the board" of the magazine. The deal ended up falling through, and she was never on any board. Her most recent venture launched in May. Chasm is a $25,000-a-year membership club that aims to "close the gender gap through entrepreneurship." The club says its members include singer Lionel Richie and Spanx's Sara Blakely, neither of whom responded to Business Insider's request for comment. Membership fees will fund a website and award monthly five-figure grants to entrepreneurs, the first of which was announced on August 6. After being contacted for comment, Pierson issued a statement — which she also shared on Instagram — claiming there was a coordinated effort by individuals "who represent everything that my gender equality initiatives have fought to change." She said they had launched a "smear campaign" against her and her companies, spreading "false statements and fabricated information" aimed at eliminating her ability to "continue to put millions of my own dollars into helping women." "These false statements don't just affect me," she wrote. "They affect the thousands of women who we fund, spotlight, or promote via my companies." She said The Newsette Media Group "absolutely did" make $40 million in 2021, and defended Chasm, saying it was "on track to give away free resources and grants for female entrepreneurs worth millions this year alone." In a 2021 podcast interview, Pierson offered a vision of what it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. "If you can sell yourself," she said, "you can basically do anything."

Title: Ethereum Price Rebounds, Traders Are Scooping Up Pepe and This New ETH Memecoin Set For 150x Gains
URL: https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-price-rebounds-traders-are-scooping-up-pepe-and-this-new-eth-memecoin-set-for-150x-gains/

Ethereum prices cooled off this weekend after briefly flirting with the hallowed $4K range, dipping below $3,400. However, at the beginning of the week, the leading Layer-1 protocol bounced back to reclaim $3,560. But whilst whales are buying ETH in droves, the smart money is looking elsewhere for serious gains—and the next ETH meme token earmarked by analysts for 150x gains has arrived in the form of Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Pundits believe that the Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution memecoin is fully primed to outpace even Ethereum itself with staking rewards above 20,000% APY and explosive price potential. Learn why this low-cap blue chip gem in its crypto presale stage is seen in crypto circles as the next big thing. Despite the recent uptick in Ethereum prices due to whale activity and on-chain ETF holdings surging to 40% in the past month—not to mention institutional giants like BlackRock also ramping up—its fundamental issues remain unsolved. Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts, but it hasn’t aged gracefully. High gas fees and slow confirmation times persist, requiring a legitimate Ethereum Layer 2 geared specifically to tackle these pain points head-on. Here’s why Layer Brett solves them: Layer Brett makes your Ethereum transactions run smoothly, bull or bear market notwithstanding, by processing transactions offchain and syncing securely back to the Ethereum mainnet. Most meme tokens are just hype with no real features. That’s not the case here with Layer Brett. Beneath the viral-inducing packaging, Layer Brett offers massive utility. It’s a fully scalable, functional blockchain project with actual user benefits. Through its native dApp, users can stake $LBRETT in seconds, earning massive yields powered by low operating costs. Ethereum staking, by contrast, involves lockups, centralization risk, and far lower returns. Layer Brett offers strictly better rewards—adding fun to function altogether. Ethereum will always be a foundational piece of crypto infrastructure. But traders are increasingly diversifying into projects like Layer Brett that offer meme coin upside with actual blockchain substance. While Ethereum is valued in the hundreds of billions, $LBRETT is still under the radar. That means there’s more room for exponential growth. And with current Ethereum gas fees still reaching $10–$20 during congestion, it’s no surprise users are migrating to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Layer Brett. Unlike basic meme plays, Layer Brett fuses viral appeal with real infrastructure. It’s meme-born, utility-built. This project is already generating massive attention as one of the top diamonds in the rough in presale right now. With just 10 billion tokens, a transparent tokenomics model, and a $1 million giveaway, early buyers are perfectly positioned for huge upside. Add in NFT integration, gamified staking, and future cross-chain interoperability, and it’s clear Layer Brett is built to scale. Ethereum led the revolution—but now, Layer Brett is pushing it further. With the speed of Layer 2, the power of community, and the potential for 150x gains, this is the best crypto to invest in before the next crypto bull run in 2025 kicks off. Buy, stake, and meme your way into the future. Don’t let this Layer 2 rocket take off without you. Layer Brett is available in presale—but don’t wait too late. This is YOUR opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum. Disclaimer. This is a Press Release.

Title: Billionaire Bill Gross says GameStop now trades more like Bitcoin than a meme stock
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/gamestop-bitcoin-trading-patterns/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T04:16:27Z
Full Content:
Share this article Legendary investor Bill Gross said GameStop (GME) is shedding its meme stock roots and now “mimics Bitcoin.” The “Bond King” recently told Business Insider that GameStop is “much less volatile” and no longer behaves like a meme stock, though he still considers it “a good candidate for option selling.” According to Gross, GameStop has moved in a pattern similar to Bitcoin. The stock rose in late 2024, dipped in spring 2025, and then rebounded in May. It has traded between $20 and $35 over the past 12 months, a stark contrast to its wild swings from $1 in the summer of 2020 to an intraday peak of $121 in January 2021. GameStop reached a 12-month high above $35 in May, just one day before the company revealed its first Bitcoin purchase. GameStop’s 4,710 BTC stash is now valued at around $539 million. The stock has since declined; it closed at approximately $23 on Wednesday, down 27% year-to-date, per Yahoo Finance data. Gross said he’s steering clear of new meme stocks like American Eagle, despite profiting from shorting GameStop and AMC during the 2021 trading frenzy. American Eagle recently gained meme stock status after a Sydney Sweeney ad campaign fueled retail buzz. He noted that retail traders are focusing on tech giants Microsoft and Meta, which are up 30% and 25% this year, respectively, due to artificial intelligence enthusiasm. GameStop, holding over $9 billion in cash and marketable securities, intends to continue investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. However, unlike Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, and others, the video game retailer is following its own playbook. CEO Ryan Cohen said previously that the company would be selectively engaging when the risk-reward balance is favorable. Cohen also discussed the potential for accepting crypto payments for trading cards, dependent on customer interest. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Ethereum’s $10B OI wipeout and ETF exodus: What happens to ETH?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-10b-oi-wipeout-and-etf-exodus-what-happens-to-eth/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T02:00:31Z
Full Content:
Can ETH reclaim $3,900 without ETF inflows? Ethereum is starting to show signs of distribution. Its ETFs saw the biggest outflow ever. That lines up with the drop below $3.6k. Is more downside coming? Ethereum’s [ETH] has been range-bound since tagging $3,900, and the price is now sitting at a key pivot. The 10% pullback off the highs looks like a textbook flush, clearing out weak longs and cooling overheated funding. Backing that up, over $10 billion in Open Interest got wiped out in just ten days. That’s a major de-risk across the board. Plus, we saw back-to-back $1 billion+ in Realized Profits, pointing to profit, not panic, as the main driver. Structurally, last week gave us Ethereum’s first proper weekly red candle in a while. It was a clean 9.67% pullback off the top. But this week’s already bounced back nearly 4%, so bulls aren’t out of the fight yet. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) That kind of resilience in a choppy market signals strong bid interest. Case in point: BlackRock scooped up 23k ETH ($88 million). It is a big tell that smart money’s still buying the dip. But is that enough to offset a $10 billion OI flush, especially with whale addresses down 164 in 30 days? According to AMBCrypto, that’s the real equation. How it resolves could dictate Ethereum’s next leg, especially with ETH/USDT longs now over 60% on Binance, showing a clear bullish crowd skew. Calling ETH’s 10% pullback a “healthy reset” might be jumping the gun. Early distribution signals are in play, and $3.9k is starting to look like a local top, or at least a level that’s going to need serious spot demand to break through again. Per SoSoValue, ETH ETF outflows just hit record levels, with over $500 million yanked in a single day. It’s a clear shift in institutional flows, flipping from steady July inflows to full-blown cooldown mode. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, Fidelity moved 14,978 ETH ($53.6 million) to Coinbase Prime, likely gearing up to sell into strength. That’s a textbook profit-taking play from smart money as the market turns risk-off. All eyes are now on ETH’s 4% bounce off the lows. If these outflows keep coming and whales keep trimming, we could see a liquidation cascade with $60 million in liquidity stacked around the $3,500 level. In short, Ethereum’s bounce has legs. But it’s walking a tightrope. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In SpaceMobile (ASTS) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you are a long-term stockholder in SpaceMobile between November 14, 2023 to April 1, 2024 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648. NEW YORK, Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against SpaceMobile on April 17, 2024 with a Class Period from November 14, 2023 to April 1, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of SpaceMobile have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. On April 1, 2024, after the market closed, SpaceMobile issued a press release disclosing that production of five Block 1 BlueBird satellites had been “impacted by two suppliers, leading to delays in integration and testing.” As a result, these five satellites were expected to be transported to the launch site between July and August 2024, later than the previously expected launch in the first quarter of 2024. On this news, SpaceMobile’s stock price fell $0.62, or 23.6%, to close at $2.01 per share on April 2, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that production of the Company’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites had been negatively impacted by two suppliers of key subsystems; (2) that a result, the Company had not substantially completed the production of the Block 1 BlueBird satellites; (3) that, as a result, the Company’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites were not on track to launch in the first quarter of 2024; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you are a long-term stockholder of SpaceMobile, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Donald Trump Outlines Economic Alternative to Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/08/06/donald-trump-outlines-economic-alternative-to-migration/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T22:14:30Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump outlined his support for a low-migration/high-productivity economy in an interview with Breitbart News. “We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” he told Breitbart News, adding: We don’t enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically … It’s going to be big. Then, somebody is going to have to make the robots. The whole thing, it feeds on itself … we’re going to streamline things. We need efficiency. July data showing a drop in the number of working migrants is welcome news, Trump told CNBC on August 5. “That’s a great number because it means we’re putting Americans to work.” Trump’s comments sketch a possible new economic strategy, said Mark Krikorian, founder of the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued: I don’t think they’ve gotten to the point of talking about robotics and AI as a substitute for migration … This is something that it would behoove the administration to present in a more rigorous and thought-out way where they actually connect the dots and explain what it is they have in mind. Our whole debate needs to get away from this “Legal [immigration] good/illegal [immigration] bad” dichotomy and talk about how the large-scale importation of foreign labor, whether it’s legal or illegal, whether it’s permanent or temporary, affects future productivity in a negative way. [The productivity alternative] provides voters with an understanding of why we should be enforcing the immigration law: Why do we want less illegal immigration? Yes, it’s illegal, obviously. And yes, some of them are criminals, but most of them aren’t …. We need to do this [enforcement] precisely because it will lead to higher productivity down the road with these advances in robotics and AI. Trump’s emphasis on robots reflects chatter in elite circles about the need to grow the economy and prosperity via productivity. If enacted, it would be a big shift from the post-1990 policy of inflating the stock market by extracting workers, consumers, and renters from poor countries. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added: And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Some leaders in Western countries are recognizing the need to grow productivity, not foreign populations. That relook is being accelerated by the growing scale of crimes, corruption, and civic conflict caused by the migrant inflows. On July 23, Trump signed a national AI strategy and told his audience of investors: Perhaps most importantly, winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley and long beyond Silicon Valley. For too long, much of our tech industry pursued a radical globalism that left millions of Americans feeling distrustful and betrayed. And you know that, everybody knows that, everybody in this room certainly does. Many of our largest tech companies have reaped the blessings of American freedom while building their factories in China, hiring workers in India and slashing profits in Ireland. You know that. All the while dismissing and even censoring their fellow citizens right here at home. Under President Trump those days are over. We need US technology companies to be all in for America. We want you to put America first. You have to do that. That’s all we ask. But Trump’s strategy faces huge obstacles, including the demand by the investors in Fortune 500 companies for a greater inflow of cheap foreign white-collar workers. So far, Trump’s deputies have just a few curbs on the legalized white-collar migration. The inflow keeps at least 1.5 million foreign graduates in U.S. jobs, and pushes many American STEM, business, and healthcare graduates out of the middle class, and away from entrepreneurship and management careers. The migration inflow also helps the corporate directors to shift more investment and middle-class jobs back to India, regardless of the damage to professionalism, innovation, and national security. Investor groups and their progressive allies say they favor a policy that maximizes both productivity and migration, especially of Indian workers. But their advocates ignore the abundant evidence that migration reduces productivity while also expanding chaotic diversity and government spending. Major media outlets are also eager to hide any alternatives to migration, or even recognition of the economic costs of migration. For example, the editorial board at Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post argued on August 5 in favor of allowing illegal migrants to stay in the agriculture sector: “This frontal attack [by ICE] on farmers must end … They need relief from overregulation and excessive immigration enforcement.” Bezos owns Amazon.com, which gains from any inflow of foreign consumers into the U.S. economy. But Trump’s talk of robots may help inquisitive reporters describe the strategic choice, said Krikorian. “You need to give them the outline for them to write about it [because] you can’t expect most of them to be connecting the dots.” In another corner of U.S. politics, Trump is also trying to deliver manual-labor migrants to the GOP’s important farm-sector interest group. “Well, we want to take care of our American workers first and foremost, and that’s what we’re doing,” Trump told Breitbart News when he was asked about proposals to import more workers for the farm sector. “We also want to help our farmers because our farmers are producing like never before. We have to help them, and we’re working out some very complicated strategies and language.” “We can’t let our farmers not have anybody,” Trump told CNBC, adding: You know, these are very these people, they’re you can’t replace them very easily. You know, people that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work. And they’ve tried, we’ve tried. Everybody tried. They don’t do it. These people do it naturally, naturally. I said, what happens if they get it to a farmer the other day, what happens if they get a bad back? He said, they don’t get a bad back, sir, because if they get a bad back, they die. I said that’s interesting, isn’t it? Agriculture Secretary Rollins is talking up the need for greater automation in the farm sector, which is facing growing competition from low-wage countries. Congress has avoided the debate, but a growing number of GOP politicians are joining the productivity-beats-migration view. “They’re laying off all these American workers and then they’re importing H-1B visa people to work for cheaper,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said July 28. ” I think that’s a total scam,” he said. “Is that good policy for us as a country to have Americans put out of work and then to bring in H-1B [visa workers]?” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: VanEck Says One Altcoin Ecosystem Seeing Early Institutional Tokenization Interest Amid Surge in Stablecoins

Crypto asset management giant VanEck says that one altcoin project is flashing major signs of institutional adoption. In a new report, VanEck highlights the growth of the Hedera (HBAR) ecosystem, which the firm notes in July, saw a price increase of over 70% due to a “wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization.” VanEck named several examples of notable adoption of the Hedera network in July, including the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Project Acacia, which aims to explore the development of Australian wholesale tokenized asset markets. Archax, the first regulated global digital asset exchange in the UK, also announced it would begin using the Hedera network for settlement purposes, VanEck notes. “Institutional tokenization activity is also emerging. In late July, Archax created Hedera token contracts named after BlackRock, Fidelity ILF, State Street, Aberdeen Investments, and LGIM. Archax’s CEO confirmed these represent money market funds that could soon transact in HBAR, signaling early but still prelaunch interest in real-world asset tokenization on the network.” And according to VanEck, stablecoin supply has exploded on Hedera. DefiLlama data shows that Hedera’s stablecoins are almost entirely driven by Circle’s USDC. “Hedera’s on-chain activity was strong as Hedera’s transactions surged as did the supply of stablecoins on its blockchain.” At time of writing, HBAR is trading at $0.24 with a market cap of $10.3 billion.

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump earlier today, reports CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos, after the firm hit back against kill switches in its GPUs in an earlier blog post. NVIDIA, the most valuable company in the world, is at the center of the global technology industry's attention due to its AI GPUs and their sales restrictions. Its recent blog post came after an earlier announcement shared that the firm expected the Trump administration to grant China AI GPU export licenses, and while the content of Huang's meeting with Trump is unclear, it could revolve around the license approvals and kill switches inside the GPUs. While the Trump administration has decided to process China AI GPU licenses, it is unclear while NVIDIA has started to receive them. The firm's smaller rival, AMD, has yet to receive licenses for the chips that were restricted for sale to China earlier this year; a fact that its CEO, Lisa Su, confirmed in an interview earlier today. As a result, NVIDIA could be waiting for the license approval, with a key bargaining point being backdoors, as it tries to secure approval for the Chinese products. Huang's visit to the White House comes as Apple CEO Tim Cook is also expected to be present there to announce a $600 billion investment package in the US. The package is expected to add $100 billion to Apple's earlier investment, with the firm's shares rising by 6% today on the news. Apple has run into trouble with the Trump administration as its efforts to shift production to India from China have come right when the US government is increasing the pressure on the country to stop buying Russian oil. As a result, the shares gained today as investors expected a thaw in its relations with the government. Since CNBC spotted Huang at the White House with a camera placed to note Cook's arrival, it's unclear why the CEO is meeting with the president. However, given the current environment surrounding its China GPUs, potential backdoors and license approvals, it's likely that these could be the talking points on the agenda. NVIDIA has already announced a $500 billion AI data center infrastructure investment in the US, which makes it unlikely that the firm could announce more investments later during the afternoon. #Breaking.

Title: No Interference? AST SpaceMobile Defends Use of Ham Radio Spectrum

Facing thousands of complaints, AST SpaceMobile is pushing back against concerns that the company’s giant satellites risk interfering with amateur “ham” radio operations across the globe. On Tuesday, the company sent a letter to the US Federal Communications Commission, defending its plan to use the 430 to 440MHz radio bands outside the US to track and control its proposed fleet of 248 satellites. Those bands have long been allocated to amateur radio operations, including for emergency communications, so the community has been campaigning to stop AST from gaining access. It flooded the FCC's online system with over 2,500 comments, many of them protesting AST’s plan to use the spectrum. AST SpaceMobile finally responded by telling the FCC that it has designed its satellites to "mitigate interference" with amateur radio bands. In addition, the company says it’s proposing "very limited, non-routine" use of the 430 to 440MHz bands and only for launch and early orbit phases for its satellites or "emergency operations when other frequency bands are unavailable." AST also says it can shut down radio band use if interference is detected. In addition, the company has submitted an analysis from a third-party company, RKF Engineering Solutions, which found the risk of interference to amateur radio operators to be “extremely unlikely.” “Modeling shows that even under worst-case conditions, the probability of interference with amateur satellite service is extremely small—less than 0.1% per pass, and only a handful of events were observed in a 30‑day simulation,” the analysis says. AST is urging the FCC to greenlight its plan to launch and operate commercial services over its 248-satellite constellation, which is designed to beam connectivity to everyday smartphones. The resulting system will compete with SpaceX's cellular Starlink service, which is already available through T-Mobile. However, the amateur radio community has been calling on the FCC to deny AST's push to use the 430 to 440MHz bands. On Tuesday, the American Radio Relay League sent its own letter to the Commission, highlighting the stiff opposition across the amateur radio community to the spectrum use. “At least 17 national radio amateur societies from around the world took the extraordinary step of making their opposition known to the Commission,” the letter says. Some of the amateur radio groups also claim to have detected interference in Europe from AST’s fleet of existing satellites, the first five BlueBirds and the BlueWalker 3. “Unlike many commercial services, amateur radio is often the only communication system still operational during natural disasters and emergencies,” the Bulgarian Federation of Radio Amateurs told the FCC. In its letter to the FCC, AST said: “Despite contrary claims from some amateur radio commenters, AST SpaceMobile is not transmitting in the 430-440 MHz band on the BB1s or BW3.” Still, one amateur radio group has detected evidence that AST merely shut down the radio communications from the BlueWalker-3 satellite two weeks ago.

Title: Why AMD Stock Is Tumbling Despite Better-Than-Expected Results

Better-than-expected sales and guidance weren’t enough to lift Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock over the high bar set by its run-up in recent months. AMD on Tuesday reported second-quarter sales that topped estimates, and offered Wall Street a rosier-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Still, shares of the Nvidia competitor were down nearly 7% in recent trading. Above-consensus revenue was driven by strength in AMD’s gaming segment, while earnings, margins, and data center sales were negatively impacted by an $800 million charge related to restrictions on the sale of AI chips to China. The company projected growth at all of its units in the third quarter, and forecast double-digit revenue growth as it ramps sales of its MI355X next-gen AI chip. Most analysts attributed the market's reaction on Wednesday to high expectations and a lofty valuation. “We believe guidance for the AI chip business was in line with Buyside expectations (based on our investor discussions), which is why the stock traded lower," according to Citigroup analysts. Bank of America analysts predicted Wall Street was reacting negatively to "likely ignorable earnings noise" and that the stock wasn't helped by its approximately 80% run-up in the three months leading up to Tuesday's results. One big unknown still hanging over AMD is how much revenue the company will generate when it resumes sales of its MI308 chip to China. (The MI308 was designed expressly for Chinese customers to satisfy Biden-era restrictions.) AMD and Nvidia last month said the Commerce Department had agreed to restart reviewing their export license applications after abruptly halting them earlier in the year. Nonetheless, AMD excluded MI308 sales from its guidance on Tuesday. “There are no China GPU licenses yet, which didn't hurt the outlook but possibly is a letdown for those modeling a $500mn quarterly China contribution in Q3/Q4,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Wednesday. But BofA saw reason for optimism in the outlook. “AMD now expects ~$1.7bn in Q3 GPU sales even without ~$800mn of lost China revenue, suggesting overall ~$500mn higher outlook excluding China vs. $2.0bn pre-ban consensus.” Wedbush analysts echoed that bullish view. “The Q3 outlook was better than expected on substantial Q/Q DC GPU growth expectations, even without assuming any MI308 export licenses are granted,” they wrote. “In turn, we believe this guide sets up AMD to exceed our prior outlook for the out quarters.” Analysts at Wedbush raised their AMD stock price target to $190 from $170 on Wednesday. The firm maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock. Citigroup lifted its price target to $180 from $165 but stood by its “neutral” rating, citing elevated expectations. Seven of the 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current AMD ratings and price targets rate the stock a “buy,” with the remainder assigning it a neutral rating. The average price target of $183 implied about 5% upside from Tuesday’s closing price. AMD shares were trading at about $161 midday Wednesday.

Title: Lucid (LCID) faced challenges in Q2, but here’s why the CEO is still confident about the future

Lucid Group’s (LCID) stock is dropping on Wednesday after the company missed Q2 expectations. CEO Marc Winterhoff admitted during a new interview that the auto tariffs and the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit “keeps us up at night,” but promises things are looking up from here. After missing top and bottom line expectations, Winterhoff told investors on the company’s earnings call that Lucid is “entering a pivotal new phase.” Despite the reassurance, Lucid’s CEO admitted several things negatively impacted earnings. For one, its gross margin for the quarter was -105%, due to $54 million in extra costs from tariffs. Lucid also lowered its production goal for the year from a firm 20,000 to between 18,000 and 20,000. The company stated that the updated range reflects the changing market. During an interview on Wednesday morning, Winterhoff told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau that changes in trade, tariffs, and tax credits are “something that, you know, keeps us up at night.” Lucid posted revenue of $259.4 million, missing Wall Street’s estimates of around $280 million. It also reported a wider-than-expected net loss of $790 million, or a loss of $ 0.34 per share. Winterhoff told LeBeau that the biggest challenge Lucid faced in Q2 was tariffs, which had a bigger impact on gross margins than expected. However, it should work itself out throughout the remainder of the year, Lucid’s CEO added. The other topic that many were wondering about was the availability of Earth magnets. Winterhoff explained that, unlike most of its competitors, Lucid was able to overcome the issue. If it weren’t for Lucid’s quick actions, the company would have had to stop production in Q2. Instead, Winterhoff said that the company now has the raw materials, earth magnets, and licensing for the remainder of the year. Lucid’s CEO added, “We are actually in a good place right now.” The company secured a partnership with Uber and Nuro to develop and deploy 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. As part of the agreement, Uber is investing $300 million into Lucid. Although it missed expectations, Lucid is still making progress. The EV maker is coming off its sixth straight quarter with record deliveries. It also produced a record number of vehicles in Q2. After overcoming supply chain issues that limited Gravity output, Lucid said it’s on track to “significantly increase production” in the second half of the year. Lucid ended the quarter with $4.86 billion in total liquidity, which it expects will provide funding through the second half of 2026, when it plans to launch its midsize platform. The midsize platform will have at least three “top hots,” or vehicles, including an electric SUV and Sedan. With prices expected to start at around $50,000, Lucid’s midsize EVs are expected to go head-to-head with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3. Lucid Group’s (LCID) stock is down about 10% on Wednesday following Q2 earnings. Despite share prices surging after the Uber partnership last month, Lucid’s stock is still down nearly 30% over the past 12 months. The company is planning a reverse stock split, which will be voted on at an upcoming investor meeting, to boost the share price and attract larger investors.

Title: Texas Gov. Wants Democrats Who Left State Kicked Out Of Office. Can He Legally Do It?

ByAlison Durkee ByAlison Durkee, Forbes Staff. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to oust from office the Democratic leader who fled the state to block Republican's attempt at redistricting — though it’s unclear if the latest move in the escalating battle over redistricting will actually work. Abbott filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court Tuesday that asks the court to declare that state Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, has forfeited his office by leaving the state. Wu and more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues left Texas on Sunday in order to block GOP lawmakers from changing the state’s congressional map to more heavily favor Republicans; their absence left the legislature short of the quorum that’s necessary in order to hold votes. Abbott argued the Supreme Court should expel Wu because the Democrat abdicated his position by leaving the state and refusing to show up for work, writing, “This Court should make clear that a legislator who does not wish to perform his duties will be stripped of them.” Texas law gives the state Supreme Court power to issue what’s called a “writ of quo warranto”—Latin for “by what warrant”—against state officials, which is a legal determination over whether the official has the right to hold office. Paxton also said he will take legal action against Democratic lawmakers if they don’t return to Texas by Friday, invoking a separate state law that gives attorneys general and district attorneys the power to file “quo warranto” petitions in court if a “public officer does an act or allows an act that by law causes a forfeiture of his office.” Wu has remained defiant—saying in a statement that leaving the state “was not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath”—and it’s unclear if Abbott and Paxton’s legal gambit will work, whether for Wu or as a broader effort to expel Democratic lawmakers. Abbott has asked the state Supreme Court to rule on whether Wu has forfeited his office by Thursday at 5 p.m. local time, though Paxton asked justices to hold off on making their decision until Friday, which is Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows’ deadline for Democratic lawmakers to return to the state. Paxton has said he “intends to pursue all available judicial remedies” if Democrats don’t return by Friday, including through the “quo warranto” petition process. It remains to be seen if the attorney general will also take aim at Wu specifically, or if he could file more legal challenges against all of the absent Democrats. “I took an oath to the Constitution, not to a politician’s agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath,” Wu said in a statement Tuesday responding to Abbott’s lawsuit and allegations that the lawmaker has abdicated his duty as a legislator. “When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant … Unable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.” It will ultimately be up to the courts to determine whether or not lawmakers can be removed. The legal statute that Abbott invoked in his lawsuit doesn’t specify a legal process for the Supreme Court issuing a writ of quo warranto, and it remains to be seen if justices will draw out the process by asking for a hearing or additional court briefs to be filed. The separate statute giving Paxton and local district attorneys authority to ask courts to remove lawmakers says that if there’s “probable ground” to challenge a person’s office, local judges will ultimately decide the outcome of those requests. That suggests that any effort to remove lawmakers could take a while to play out, particularly if challenges are filed against multiple lawmakers in different courts. That would leave it up to each individual judge to determine when any rulings could come out, Politico notes, and Paxton told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that bringing “quo warranto” challenges won’t result in an “immediate answer” over whether lawmakers can be removed. “We’d have to go through the court process, and we’d have to file … in districts that are not friendly to Republicans,” Paxton told Johnson, noting “every, every district would be different.” “We’d have to go sue in every legislator’s home district to try to execute on that idea,” the attorney general said. It’s still unclear how the Texas Supreme Court could rule on Abbott’s request to expel Wu. In a 2021 legal opinion, Paxton said lawmakers breaking a quorum could constitute an “abandonment of office” that justifies removing them, but that opinion is non-binding, and Paxton said the issue must ultimately be decided by the courts. The state’s Supreme Court is made up exclusively of Republicans, including multiple justices that Abbott appointed himself. Chief Justice Jimmy Blacklock is also Abbott’s former general counsel, and the governor said when he appointed the justice in 2018 that he “wanted to make sure that the person I appointed was going to make decisions that I know how they are going to decide.” That being said, Blackrock authored a 2021 opinion that said the Texas Constitution “does enable quorum breaking by a minority faction,” suggesting Democrats’ actions are lawful—though he also said the Constitution allows lawmakers to impose penalties in order to compel members’ attendance. Legal experts cited by the Texas Tribune argued it’s unlikely that taking action to break a quorum would be considered abdicating a lawmaker’s duty, as Abbott claims. “I am aware of absolutely no authority that says breaking quorum is the same as the intent to abandon a seat,” University of Missouri constitutional law expert Charles “Rocky” Rhodes told the Tribune, arguing that would be “inconsistent with the very text of the Texas Constitution.” Democrats left the state in order to halt a special session of the legislature that’s slated to end in late August. They would have to stay out of state for even longer in order to actually block the redistricting process, however, as Abbott could simply call a new special session whenever they return. Lawmakers would have to stay out of Texas until at least November to successfully stop the new maps, Rice University political science professor Mark P. Jones told the Texas Tribune. That’s when filing opens for the 2026 midterms, meaning new congressional districts would have to be set by that point. It’s unclear if Democrats will successfully be able to stay out of state for that long, given lawmakers’ commitments at home and a $500 fine that accrues per lawmaker for each day they remain out of state. Texas Democrats’ decision to leave the state in order to block redistricting comes as the issue of changing states’ congressional maps outside the normal 10-year timeframe has become a national issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democrats are historically favored to fare better in the midterms as the minority party, prompting Republicans in states like Texas to try and manipulate congressional districts to their advantage and add GOP-leaning seats. In addition to Texas, Republican officials in states such as Missouri, Florida and Indiana have at least floated the idea of redistricting—prompting Democrats in states like California, New York and Maryland to also consider redrawing their maps in order to balance out any advantage Republicans give themselves. Texas has become the first flashpoint in the redistricting debate, with Democrats leaving the state Sunday afternoon—repeating a playbook that Texas Democrats have used before to stymie the legislature, most recently in 2021. Abbott’s lawsuit Tuesday came after the governor previously threatened over the weekend to take legal action against the lawmakers. The Texas House has separately issued arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers. Those warrants are ineffective while the lawmakers remain out of state, however, as Democratic lawmakers in the states where the legislators have relocated—primarily Illinois—have refused to extradite them to Texas to be prosecuted.

Title: Top-ranked 400m runner Conor Kelly leads Irish medal hopes at European Under-20 championships

Conor Kelly and Cormac Dixon will be looking to maintain the Irish athletics medals rush of recent weeks when the European Under-20 Championships get under way in Tampere, Finland on Thursday morning. It is 50 years since John Treacy claimed Ireland’s first medal in these championships, winning silver in the 5,000m in Athens in 1975. Plenty of other successful names have followed in his footsteps, including Mark Carroll, Ciara Mageean, Sarah Lavin, Sarah Healy, Kate O’Connor and Rhasidat Adeleke. At the last edition of these championships, two years ago in Jerusalem, Elizabeth Ndudi won gold in the long jump and Nick Griggs won silver in the 3,000m. There are similarly high expectations for the team of 38 athletes in Tampere. Kelly is the top-ranked Under-20 European in the 400m this season, his 45.85 clocked at the Morton Games last month the only sub-46-second entry. The Finn Valley AC athlete only turned 18 last month, but has considerable experience, winning his first Irish senior title indoors earlier this year. Dixon is the top-ranked athlete in the 3,000m, running 7:56.59 indoors in the US earlier this season, where the Tallaght AC athlete is on a running scholarship at Providence College, the same alma mater as Treacy. Precious Akpe-Moses from Blackrock AC is the top-ranked Irish athlete in the women’s 100m and 200m. She is hoping to emulate her older sister Gina, who won the European Under-20 100m title in 2017. The Irish men’s 4x400m team are also the top-ranked team in Europe this year. They can draw on individual qualifiers Kelly, Seán Doggett (Athenry AC) and Alex Cullen (Kilkenny City Harriers), along with David Davitt (Clonliffe Harriers), Andrew Hayes (Dundrum South Dublin AC) and Christopher Lynch (Clonliffe Harriers). [ Athletics Nick Griggs: ‘It very quickly went from a running injury to a serious medical illness’Opens in new window ] In the field events, 2024 European Under-18 medallist Cian Crampton (Edenderry AC) competes in the discus, after throwing a national Under-20 record of 58.32m at the start of June. Tampere has played host to Irish success before. In 2018 it was the venue when the Irish women’s 4x100m relay team of Adeleke, Molly Scott, Ciara Neville, Gina Akpe-Moses and Patience Jumbo-Gula won the silver medal in the World Under-20 Championships. Enya Silkena (Ratoath AC) will have been inspired by the success of Kate O’Connor in the heptathlon in recent times, achieving a personal best to qualify for the championships.

Title: July earnings update: Boeing, UnitedHealth Group, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and BlackRock

Let CFO.com's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Cathy Smith of Starbucks talks long-term cost structure, John Murphy of Coca-Cola focuses on margin expansion and Kim Kuryea of General Dynamics highlights record backlog and cash flow. Earnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization’s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts’ questions. For July, we highlight CFO comments from Boeing, UnitedHealth Group, General Dynamics, Starbucks, The Cheesecake Factory, Tractor Supply, Coca-Cola and BlackRock. Market Cap: $170.53 billion Date of Call: July 29 Boeing’s recent financial performance shows how CFOs can stabilize operations and narrow losses during challenging times by leaning on delivery execution and steady working capital improvements. In his final earnings call in the position, CFO Brian West said free cash flow usage of $200 million in Q2 was significantly better than expected, driven by 150 commercial deliveries that included 13 777 jets, nearly double the usual volume. West projected approximately $3 billion in free cash flow for the year, assuming no major disruptions. The company also held firm on its strategy to reintegrate Spirit AeroSystems and normalize inventory as production stabilizes. "Margins at [Boeing Commercial Airplanes] were negative 6.6% in Q1, improved to negative 5.1% in Q2 and we expect to continue improving quarter by quarter, although still negative for the year," West said. "Long term, there's nothing we see that would suggest we can't get back to historical margin levels." Market Cap: $224.32 billion Date of Call: July 29 UnitedHealth Group is adjusting expectations for 2025 as elevated medical costs, exchange-related headwinds and slower OptumHealth growth weigh on results. Outgoing CFO John Rex reported Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $4.08, down from the prior year, and revised full-year guidance to at least $16 per share. The updated outlook includes $1.6 billion in potential settlement items, with $600 million recognized in Q2 and another $1 billion anticipated. Rex noted a full-year medical care ratio of 89.25%, up from the previously forecasted 86.5%, driven by higher patient morbidity in Affordable Care Act exchanges and changes tied to Medicare and the Inflation Reduction Act. "As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect efforts underway to steadily improve our performance," Rex said, pointing to renewed focus on pricing, operational discipline and longer-term investment in AI and modernization. Market Cap: $101.46 billion Date of Call: July 29 Starbucks CFO Cathy Smith said the company is focused on building a more durable cost structure to support its long-term turnaround. Four months into the role, Smith said the company is investing in foundational changes, including a $500 million labor investment while working across the P&L to find efficiencies. “We are, as we shared even last quarter, working across the entire P&L,” Smith said. “From cost of goods sold to operating expenses to G&A, the team is taking on both short-term and long-term cost structure efficiency work.” She emphasized the importance of building sustainability into the turnaround. “We’re working on 2026, 2027 and 2028,” she said. “We’re putting in the more durable sustainable activities to make sure we don’t just address it once, but we actually address it long term.” Smith said the company is focused on setting the foundation for future earnings growth. “What’s really exciting though is when we start to grow, we’ll actually like what comes through to the bottom line.” Market Cap: $3.09 billion Date of Call: July 29 Matthew Clark, CFO of Cheesecake Factory, said stable consumer trends and execution across concepts supported margin gains and stronger-than-expected results in the second quarter. Revenue reached $956 million with an adjusted net income margin of 5.8%, exceeding the company’s guidance range. Clark highlighted improved labor productivity, lower commodity costs and disciplined pricing as key drivers of margin performance. “We feel really good about where we’re sitting today,” Clark said. “The environment has been very, very steady for us… and I think it’s a testament to our execution as well as the brands that we have.” The company plans to open up to 25 new restaurants this year across its Cheesecake Factory, North Italia, Flower Child and other Fox Restaurants concepts. Clark said Flower Child, the company’s health-forward fast-casual concept, is delivering mature unit margins of 20.4%, with average unit volume approaching $5 million and returns in the mid-30% range. North Italia locations are also performing well, with new units opening above expectations and mature margins reaching 18.2%. Clark noted menu pricing will decline in the second half, driven by new lower-priced offerings. “The real pricing is probably going to be more like 2% to 2.5% in terms of what the consumer feels,” he said, emphasizing the company’s focus on perceived value and traffic recovery. Market Cap: $31.87 billion Date of Call: July 24 Kurt Barton, CFO of Tractor Supply, said the company delivered record sales and net income in Q2, with signs of momentum continuing into the back half of the year. Comps were positive across six of seven regions, and June saw gains in all regions, supported by a delayed but accelerated spring selling season. “We see demand solid. Our customers [are] in a strong position,” Barton said. “The expectation for the second half of the year would be balanced between both ticket and transactions.” Gross margin expanded by 31 basis points to 36.9%, aided by product cost management and efficiencies across the supply chain. Barton said tariff impacts have begun to flow through direct imports and will create modest pressure in the second half, though average unit retail has not yet been materially affected. “We believe we can still maintain even at these elevated comps… the operating margin rate that we gave in our guide,” he said. The company returned $196 million to shareholders in the quarter and reduced its full-year repurchase outlook, citing a “more measured pace” of capital deployment. Barton said Tractor Supply remains focused on expense control, with selling, general and administrative expenses expected to ease in the second half. Market Cap: $84.92 billion Date of Call: July 23 General Dynamics reported strong order activity and cash performance in the second quarter, with record backlog and improved free cash flow conversion. CFO Kim Kuryea said the company booked $28 billion in orders, resulting in a company-wide book-to-bill ratio of 2.2, led by marine systems. Aerospace also reported a 1.3x book-to-bill despite increased aircraft deliveries. Backlog reached a record $103.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago, with total estimated contract value exceeding $160 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion, with free cash flow of $1.4 billion and a cash conversion rate of 138%. The company expects full-year conversion to be approximately 90%, with the majority of cash generation in the fourth quarter. Kuryea noted full-year cash projections do not yet include potential benefits from recent tax legislation reversing the amortization of R&D expenses, which may provide additional cash flow depending on timing. Capital expenditures were $198 million, or 1.5% of sales, with full-year capex expected to be slightly above 2% of sales. The company paid $402 million in dividends, did not repurchase shares during the quarter, and reduced net debt by $1.2 billion to $7.2 billion. Interest expense is projected to be $330 million for the full year. Market Cap: $299.88 billion Date of Call: July 22 Coca-Cola CFO John Murphy said the company delivered strong margin expansion and free cash flow growth in the second quarter, even as unit case volume declined 1% due to soft June results. Organic revenue grew 5%, driven by price/mix gains, while comparable gross margin expanded by 80 basis points and operating margin rose 190 basis points. “We expect to deliver operating leverage in the second half of the year, albeit at a slightly lower rate than we had previously flagged,” Murphy said. He added that about one-third of the company’s underlying margin expansion came from faster realization of productivity initiatives. While the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, it now expects comparable EPS to grow 3%, down slightly due to a five-point currency headwind. Murphy said Coca-Cola plans to use its strong first-half performance to “invest some of our efficiencies” into growth for the back half of the year. He noted the updated outlook reflects a softening of earlier currency-related pressure and that Coca-Cola would provide more detail on 2026 in its October call. Though not addressed on the earnings call, the company has separately indicated plans to begin using cane sugar in U.S. beverages, a potential shift with implications for costs, marketing and consumer preferences. Market Cap: $182.97 billion Date of Call: July 15 BlackRock and its CFO Martin Small reported 6% organic base fee growth in Q2 2025, marking the company’s fourth consecutive quarter above 5%. Assets under management are also at a record $12.5 trillion. Net inflows totaled $116 billion, excluding a $52 billion institutional index redemption. Small said the firm is seeing sustained growth across ETFs, its investment technology platform Aladdin, cash management, private markets and digital assets. The acquisition of HPS Investment Partners added $165 billion of AUM and is expected to contribute $450 million in revenue in Q3. Preqin added $60 million to Q2 technology services revenue. Subscription revenue rose 26% year-over-year. Small said the firm remains on track toward its goal of $400 billion in private market fundraising between 2025 and 2030. Operating margin declined 80 basis points to 43.3%, mainly due to lower performance fees and acquisition-related expenses. Small said controllable expenses are aligned with revenue growth and that recent acquisitions are expected to be self-funding. Dividend growth is expected to track operating and net income as part of BlackRock’s 2030 strategy. Get the free daily newsletter with financial industry insights and practical advice for CFOs.

Title: Ellison Begins High Wire Act at New PARAMOUNT...

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The ambitious Oracle heir, who once counted Steve Jobs as a mentor, hopes to turn Paramount Skydance into a tech-era media monolith. But does he have the team — or the vision — to scale that mountain? By Steven Zeitchik, Alex Weprin August 6, 2025 When David Ellison had an informal meeting with New York-based media executives at a restaurant in the city earlier this year introducing the Hollywood producer to the kind of people he’d soon be communing with, the vibe was, to say the least, amiable. The Skydance founder was awaiting FCC approval on his bid to buy Paramount, and so he chatted a little and mostly listened, the executives joking about the challenged landscape as Ellison responded with platitudes about his vision for a well-run Paramount. But one point about Ellison stood out to attendees: He talked a lot about gaming. Related Stories Business Can Paramount Pivot to Big Tech? David Ellison Outlines His Silicon Valley Vision Business David Ellison Meets the Press The emphasis spoke volumes about where Ellison’s eye is trained as he takes over Paramount: Steward a company anchored by a traditional film studio and freighted down by a lot of dated television assets, sure, but also make a big push to digital frontiers. Skydance already has a hand in this world with such VR games as Archangel and The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and the chance to develop and acquire gaming companies to pair with Paramount’s robust intellectual properties and 80 million-strong streaming service Paramount+ could prove appealing. On Aug. 7, the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount deal finally closes, putting Ellison in charge of the country’s second-oldest studio — and, notably, one of its most troubled media companies. For the 42-year-old, the news represents a remarkable rise, coming just 15 years after he founded his firm and not much longer since he was written off as a wannabe actor and USC film school dropout making vanity projects like Flyboys. Even with the billions Skydance received from Ellison’s family — particularly father Larry Ellison, worth $303 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — his resurgence is the kind of thing biographers devote chapters to. The comeback for Paramount, on the other hand, is far from assured. As control of the company moves from one prominent American business family (the Redstones) to another, Ellison has talked up his tech game and has cited family friend Steve Jobs as a mentor who gave him early tough love on Skydance. Certainly the millennial comes in with some advantages: the advent of AI (which, among other things, will make content production cheaper); the use of Oracle’s top-flight cloud service to compete with what Amazon MGM can do with Amazon Web Services (AWS); Skydance’s existing partnerships with Apple and Meta on the gaming side; and even the tantalizing rumors of an Oracle stateside TikTok purchase. (If nothing else, those algorithms will make Paramount+ more Netflix-y sticky.) The automation factor in particular could get supercharged at Paramount, which unlike rivals Disney and Universal has not taken an oppositional attitude toward the tech. All suggest a company with lots of strategic upside, and those who see Paramount as an also-ran might be reminded that the rules are about to reset for everyone, as AI-powered personalized content and automated production prepare to sweep through the industry. “He’s the kind of person who’s going to take advantage of these innovations,” says a longtime exec who knows Ellison and Paramount but is not tied to either one. But how much the existing infrastructure will allow such leaps remains to be seen. Paramount is still a company built for the 1990’s, with a network TV business in CBS that is solid if hardly shiny and a cable business that is neither. Film studios are generally not a high-upside 2020’s bet, especially if some of your biggest franchises, like Mission: Impossible and Star Trek, are many installments deep. For all the hype about tech, the executive team is largely old-school Hollywood too, as new C-suite occupants such as NBC Universal veteran Jeff Shell, Sony marketing executive Josh Greenstein and even Netflix mainstay Cindy Holland cut their teeth on content, not computation. No known upstart is yet waiting in Skydance’s wings; no splashy tech import is ready to take Hollywood by storm. And talk of great tech-content synergies have accompanied many a media merger (remember AOL-Time Warner? Or AT&T-Warner?) only to end up as one more ill-fitting cost-cutting exercise (remember Discovery-Warner?) One X-factor is Andy Gordon, an incoming board member and a longtime Goldman Sachs kingmaker who’s spent the last five years with Gerry Cardinale’s entertainment-minded investment-management company RedBird Capital — and which along with Korean juggernaut CJ Group has put a lot of money into Skydance. (Along with Larry Ellison, RedBird has also helped finance the acquisition.) The ties between RedBird and the new Par go deep — Shell comes from there too — and the expectation is that Gordon as incoming Paramount COO and chief strategic officer will run point on exactly the kind of deals for his new company that he made with the likes of All3Media and Artists Equity at his old one (though, you know, with digital and AI firms). Ellison is the first figure with any tech ties, even familial, to take over a legacy media company, crossing a bridge that Disney, Universal and Rupert Murdoch have refrained from approaching. (New Paramount president Jeff Shell likes this fact, calling his ally “the perfect executive for the next-generation Hollywood company,” as “he not only can go to a table read, but he can go to the next room and code.”) At the very least, Ellison’s Hollywood experience has grown; while he was sometimes sidelined as a financier under earlier Paramount regimes, his role morphed into something more consistently substantively creative under recent studio chiefs Jim Gianopulos and Brian Robbins. Still, getting Hollywood nuts and bolts like talent relations right isn’t easy, and to say Ellison got a “C” on one of his first tests as a mogul — negotiations on a new global streaming deal with South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone — would probably involve some grade inflation. A person with knowledge of the negotiations says Ellison reassured the pair’s reps that he would sign off on a deal, but days turned to weeks with no movement. The foot-dragging led Parker and Stone to flex their power, including by threatening legal action against Shell and RedBird Capital over allegedly manipulating negotiations with rivals to lower the price for Paramount. The South Park-ers eventually got their big payday. CBS’ scrapping of Stephen Colbert and the whole Late Show franchise didn’t endear Ellison much either to the talent community, whatever the extent his knowledge of or wink at George Cheeks’ moves may have actually been. The imminent slashing of deals and inevitable staff layoffs as a cost-cutting wave arrives will further stress those relationships. And Ellison’s dynamic with journalists will be put to the test as 60 Minutes remains in free fall after Bill Owens’ departure (though Tanya Simon’s elevation reassured staff for now) and a controversial $16 million settlement with the Trump administration widely seen as quid pro quo for getting FCC-approved in the first place. CBS News also will install an ombudsman, scouring for bias, which has sparked anxiety among staff. Acquisition talks with Bari Weiss’ The Free Press will raise questions about the politics of Ellison, who has described himself as a “socially liberal” person; so will his father’s ongoing tight relationship with Donald Trump. Many of the metaphors around Ellison spotlight his love of flying – he got his pilot’s license as a teenager and has been performing aerobatic stunts ever since – as Tom Cruise and every journalist in town has invoked stalls, tailslides and inside loops to describe Ellison’s approach to challenges. But in Hollywood the more apt analogy might be to Brad Pitt’s World War Z, a movie Ellison’s money bailed out after its budget ballooned and an explosive climactic scene shot in Budapest (for Red Square) was deemed, in technical industry parlance, bad. Ellison kicked in millions for rewrites and reshoots, saving the film and launching a summer blockbuster. The irony was that the filmmaking team did this by going small: the third act of that 2013 movie as newly penned by Damon Lindelof and Drew Goddard famously featured a much quieter and more intimate ending in which Pitt walks carefully to outwit a single zombie. The Hollywood meaning is hard to miss: sometimes the unexpected move saves the day. Also, if you take a wrong step, you could get devoured. Pamela McClintock contributed to this report.

Apple and Microsoft defined the PC market; Microsoft and Intel won it. Google and Meta dominate digital advertising; Apple and Google won mobile. That, however, is not the defining pair of the smartphone era, which ran from the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 to the launch of ChatGPT in 2022; rather, the two most important companies of the last two decades of tech were Apple and Amazon, specifically AWS. The Apple part is easy: the iPhone market created the smartphone paradigm, from its user interface (touch) to its distribution channel (the App Store), and was richly rewarded with a bit under half of the unit marketshare and a bit under all of the total profits. Google did well to control the rest in terms of the Android operating system, and profit from it all thanks to Google Search, but it was Search that remained their north star; the company’s primary error in the era was the few years they let the tail (Android) wave the dog (Google). The AWS part is maybe less obvious, but no less critical — and the timing is notable. Amazon created AWS in 2006, just 10 months before the iPhone unveiling, and the paradigm they created was equally critical to the smartphone era. I explained the link in 2020’s The End of the Beginning: This last point gets at why the cloud and mobile, which are often thought of as two distinct paradigm shifts, are very much connected: the cloud meant applications and data could be accessed from anywhere; mobile made the I/O layer available everywhere. The combination of the two make computing continuous. What is notable is that the current environment appears to be the logical endpoint of all of these changes: from batch-processing to continuous computing, from a terminal in a different room to a phone in your pocket, from a tape drive to data centers all over the globe. In this view the personal computer/on-premises server era was simply a stepping stone between two ends of a clearly defined range. AWS was not the only public cloud provider, of course — Azure and Google Cloud Platform were both launched in 2008 — but by virtue of being first they both defined the paradigm and also were the the first choice of the universe of applications that ran on smartphones or, more accurately, ran everywhere. If Apple and AWS were the definers — and thus winners — of the smartphone era, then it was Microsoft and Nokia that were the losers. The reasons for their failure were myriad, but there was one common thread: neither could shake off the overhang of having won their previous paradigm; indeed, both failed in part because they deluded themselves into thinking that their previous domination was an advantage. For Microsoft that previous paradigm was the PC and the Windows platform, which the company thought they could extend to mobile; from 2014’s Microsoft’s Mobile Muddle: Saying “Microsoft missed mobile” is a bit unfair; Windows Mobile came out way back in 2000, and the whole reason Google bought Android was the fear that Microsoft would dominate mobile the way they dominated the PC era. It turned out, though, that mobile devices, with their focus on touch, simplified interfaces, and ARM foundation, were nothing like PCs. Everyone had to start from scratch, and if starting from scratch, by definition Microsoft didn’t have any sort of built-in advantage. They were simply out-executed. It took Microsoft years — and a new CEO — to realize their mistake, up and to the point where they put their enterprise productivity dominance at risk; from 2015’s Redmond and Reality: There’s reality, and there’s Redmond, and if one thing marked the last few years of Steve Ballmer’s tenure as the CEO of Microsoft, it was the sense that those were two distinct locales. In reality, Android (plus AOSP in China) and iOS were carving up the world phone market; in Redmond Ballmer doubled-down on the losing Window Phone bet by buying Nokia. In reality Office was losing relevance because of its absence on the mobile platforms that mattered; in Redmond Ballmer personally delayed Office on iOS until the Windows Modern née Metro version was finished. And in reality, all kinds of startups were taking aim at the Microsoft enterprise stack; in Redmond, Microsoft was determined to own it all, just as they had in the PC era. It’s fitting that Microsoft and Nokia ended up together; perhaps they were able to jointly go to therapy for success-induced obliviousness of market realities. Nokia dominated the phone market for the decade prior to the iPhone, and even once the iPhone was announced, blithely assumed that they could simply lean on their existing advantages to fend off the Silicon Valley usurper. From 2013’s Blackberry — and Nokia’s — Fundamental Failing: Nokia dominated all the parts of this stack you don’t see: they had, and in some respects, still have, the best supply chain and distribution network. In addition, they had high quality hardware that served every segment imaginable. Notably absent in these strengths is the OS and Apps. By 2009, BlackBerry OS and Symbian were clearly obsolete, and their app ecosystems, such as they were, were eclipsed by iOS and then Android. The problem, as I alluded to above, is that while the OS was ultimately under the control of BlackBerry and Nokia, respectively, and thus could be fixed, the efficacy of their ecosystem wasn’t, and wouldn’t be… And so, by far the smartest strategic thing either could have done would have been to accept their weakness — they didn’t have an adequate OS or ecosystem — and focus on their strengths…Nokia should have adopted Android-stock, and used their unmatched supply chain and distribution to do to their competitors, well, exactly what Nokia had been doing to their competitors for the last decade (if you think Samsung is running roughshod over everyone today, in 2007 they could only manage 41 million phones compared to Nokia’s 110 million). Both BlackBerry and Nokia would have gotten a good OS and thriving ecosystem for free and been able to compete and differentiate themselves on the exact same vectors they had previously. To put it another way, RIM and Nokia had never been successful because of their OS or ecosystem, yet both decided their best response to iOS and Android was to build a new OS! In fact, the strategic superiority of the Android option for RIM and Nokia was even then so obvious that I suspect their core failing was not so much strategic as it was all-too-human: pride. Owning an ecosystem seems much more important than owning services or supply chains, even if building said ecosystem completely devalues what you’re actually good at. If the first commonality in Microsoft and Nokia’s failure is the assumption that dominance in one paradigm would seamlessly translate into dominance in the next, then the second was in not making the strategically obvious choice — embracing iOS and Android for Windows, and Android for Nokia — for fear of losing control and long-term relevance. What separates the two companies is that Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, rectified their mistake, while Nokia doubled-down with Windows Phone; that is why Microsoft still matters today — more than ever, in fact — while Nokia phones no longer exist. The two companies that stood in constrast to Microsoft and Nokia were Google and Samsung; while their dominance of the non-iPhone market seems obvious in retrospect, it wasn’t at all pre-ordained. What is impressive about both companies is that they had the opposite of pride: both were quite shameless, in fact. From 2013’s Shameless Samsung: Every pre-iPhone phone maker is irrelevant, if they even exist, except for Samsung, who is thriving. Samsung the copycat was smart enough to realize they needed to change, and quickly, and so they did. Or maybe it wasn’t being smart. Maybe it was simply not caring what anyone else thought about them, their strategy, or their inspiration. Most successful companies, including Apple, including Google, seem remarkably capable of ignoring the naysayers and simply doing what is right for their company. In the case of smartphones, why wouldn’t you copy the iPhone? Nokia refused and look where that got them! We, especially in the West, have a powerful sense of justice and fairness when it comes to product features and being first. Business, though, is not fair, even if it is more just than we care to admit. Just as Samsung blatantly copied Apple hardware, Android blatantly copied the iOS interface: Plenty of people mocked Google for this shift, but not me: Apple figured out what worked; it would have been foolish to not copy them. Foolish like Microsoft and Nokia. There were striking resemblances in last week’s earnings calls from Apple and Amazon, not just to each other, but to this early smartphone era that I have just recounted. Both companies are facing questions about their AI strategies — Apple for its failure to invest in a large language model of its own, or deeply partner with a model builder, and Amazon for prioritizing its own custom architectures and under-deploying leading edge Nvidia solutions — and both had similar responses: It’s Early Tim Cook (from a post-earnings all-hands meeting): Cook struck an optimistic tone, noting that Apple is typically late to promising new technologies. “We’ve rarely been first,” the executive told staffers. “There was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone; there were many tablets before the iPad; there was an MP3 player before iPod.” But Apple invented the “modern” versions of those product categories, he said. “This is how I feel about AI.” Andy Jassy: The first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. If you look at what’s really happening in the space, it’s very top heavy. So you have a small number of very large frontier models that are being trained that spend a lot on computing, a couple of which are being trained on top of AWS and others are being trained elsewhere. And then you also have, I would say, a relatively small number of very large-scale generative AI applications. We Will Serve Actual Use Cases Tim Cook: We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that’s at the heart of our AI strategy. With Apple Intelligence, we’re integrating AI features across our platforms in a way that is deeply personal, private, and seamless, right where users need them. Andy Jassy: We have a very significant number of enterprises and startups who are running applications on top of AWS’ AI services and but, like the amount of usage and the expansiveness of the use cases and how much people are putting them into production and the number of agents that are going to exist, it’s still just earlier stage than it’s going to be, and so then when you think about what’s going to matter in AI, what are customers going to care about when they’re thinking about what infrastructure use, I think you kind of have to look at the different layers of the stack. And I think…if you look at where the real costs are, they’re going to ultimately be an inference today, so much of the cost in training because customers are really training their models and trying to figure out to get the applications into production. Our Chips Are Best Tim Cook: Apple Silicon is at the heart of all of these experiences, enabling powerful Apple Intelligence features to run directly on device. For more advanced tasks, our servers, also powered by Apple Silicon, deliver even greater capabilities while preserving user privacy through our Private Cloud Compute architecture. We believe our platforms offer the best way for users to experience the full potential of generative AI. Thanks to the exceptional performance of our systems, our users are able to run generative AI models right on their Mac, iPad, and iPhone. We’re excited about the work we’re doing in this space, and it’s incredibly rewarding to see the strong momentum building. Andy Jassy: At scale, 80% to 90% of the cost will be an inference because you only train periodically, but you’re spinning out predictions and inferences all the time, and so what they’re going to care a lot about is they’re going to care about the compute and the hardware they’re using. We have a very deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as I can foresee, but we saw this movie in the CPU space with Intel, where customers are anchoring for better price performance. And so we built just like in the CPU space, where we built our own custom silicon and building Graviton which is about 40% more price performance than the other leading x86 processors, we’ve done the same thing on the custom silicon side in AI with Trainium and our second version of Trainium2…it’s about 30% and 40% better price performance than the other GPU providers out there right now, and we’re already working on our third version of Trainium as well. So I think a lot of the compute and the inference is going to ultimately be run on top of Trainium2. We Have the Data Tim Cook: We’re making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year, as we had said earlier. Our focus from an AI point of view is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private, and seamlessly integrated, and, of course, we’ve done that with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features so far, from Visual Intelligence to Clean Up to Writing Tools and all the rest. Andy Jassy: People aren’t paying as close attention as they will and making sure that those generative AI applications are operating where the rest of their data and infrastructure. Remember, a lot of generative AI inference is just going to be another building block like compute, storage and database. And so people are going to actually want to run those applications close to where the other applications are running, where their data is. There’s just so many more applications and data running in AWS than anywhere else. Both Apple and Amazon’s arguments are very plausible! To summarize each: Apple: Large language models are useful, but will be a commodity, and easily accessible on your iPhone; what is the most useful to people, however, is AI that has your private data as context, and only we can provide that. We will provide AI with your data as context at scale and at low cost — both in terms of CapEx and OpEx — by primarily running inference on device. People are also concerned about sharing their personal data with AI companies, so when we need more capabilities we will use our own compute infrastructure, which will run on our own chips, not Nvidia chips. Amazon: Large language models are useful, but will be a commodity, and widely available on any cloud. What is the most useful to companies, however, is AI that has your enterprise data as context, and more enterprises are on AWS than anywhere else. We will provide AI with a company’s data as context at scale and at low cost — both in terms of CapEx and OpEx — by primarily running inference on our own AI chips, not Nvidia chips. What is notable about both arguments — and again, this doesn’t mean they are wrong! — is how conveniently they align with how the companies operated in the previous era. Apple powered apps with Apple Silicon on the edge with an emphasis on privacy, and Amazon powered apps in the cloud with its own custom architecture focused first and foremost on low costs. The risk both companies are taking is the implicit assumption that AI is not a paradigm shift like mobile was. In Apple’s case, they assume that users want an iPhone first, and will ultimately be satisfied with good-enough local AI; in AWS’s case, they assume that AI is just another primitive like compute or storage that enterprises will tack onto their AWS bill. I wrote after last fall’s re:Invent: The emphasis on “choice” in the presentation, first in terms of regular AWS, and then later in terms of AI, is another way to say that the options are, in the end, mere commodities. Sure, the cutting edge for both inference and especially training will be Nvidia, and AWS will offer Nvidia instances (to the extent they fit in AWS’ network), but AWS’s bet is that a necessary component of generative AI being productized is that models fade in importance. Note this bit from Garman leading up to his Bedrock discussion: We talked about wanting this set of building blocks that builders could use to invent anything that they could imagine. We also talked about how many of the cases we walked through today, that we’ve redefined how people thought about these as applications change. Now people’s expectations are actually changing for applications again with generative AI, and increasingly my view is generative AI inference is going to be a core building block for every single application. In fact, I think generative AI actually has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company out there, every single workflow out there, every single user experience out there… This expansive view of generative AI’s importance — notice how Garman put it on the same level as the compute, storage, and database primitives — emphasizes the importance of it becoming a commodity, with commodity-like concerns about price, performance, and flexibility. In other words, exactly what AWS excels at. To put it another way, AWS’s bet is that AI will be important enough that it won’t, in the end, be special at all, which is very much Amazon’s sweet spot. Go back to that illustration from The End of the Beginning: Apple and Amazon are betting that AI is just another primitive in continuous computing that happens everywhere. The most optimistic AI scenarios, however, point to something new: A better word for “Anywhere” is probably autonomous, but I wanted to stick with the “Where” theme; what I’m talking about, however, is agents: AI doing work without any human involvement at all. The potential productivity gains for companies are obvious: there is a massive price umbrella for inference costs if the end result is that you don’t need to employ a human to do the same work. In this world what matters most is performance, not cost, which means that Amazon’s obsession with costs is missing the point; it’s also a world where the company’s lack of a competitive leading edge model makes it harder for them to compete, particularly when there is another company in the ecosystem — Google — that not only has its own custom chip strategy (TPUs), but also is integrating those chips with its competitive leading edge large language model (Gemini). Tim Cook, meanwhile, has talked for years now about his excitement about AR glasses, which fit with the idea of augmentation; Mark Gurman reported in Bloomberg earlier this year: Still, all of this is a stepping stone toward Cook’s grand vision, which hasn’t changed in a decade. He wants true augmented reality glasses — lightweight spectacles that a customer could wear all day. The AR element will overlay data and images onto real-world views. Cook has made this idea a top priority for the company and is hell-bent on creating an industry-leading product before Meta can. “Tim cares about nothing else,” says someone with knowledge of the matter. “It’s the only thing he’s really spending his time on from a product development standpoint.” Still, it will take many years for true AR glasses to be ready. A variety of technologies need to be perfected, including extraordinarily high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip and a tiny battery that could offer hours of power each day. Apple also needs to figure out applications that make such a device as compelling as the iPhone. And all this has to be available in large quantities at a price that won’t turn off consumers. What seems likely to me is that for this product to succeed, Apple will need to figure out generative AI as well; I posited last year that generative AI will undergird future user interfaces in The Gen AI Bridge to the Future. From a section recounting my experience with Meta’s Orion AR glasses: This, I think, is the future: the exact UI you need — and nothing more — exactly when you need it, and at no time else. This specific example was, of course, programmed deterministically, but you can imagine a future where the glasses are smart enough to generate UI on the fly based on the context of not just your request, but also your broader surroundings and state. This is where you start to see the bridge: what I am describing is an application of generative AI, specifically to on-demand UI interfaces. It’s also an application that you can imagine being useful on devices that already exist. A watch application, for example, would be much more usable if, instead of trying to navigate by touch like a small iPhone, it could simply show you the exact choices you need to make at a specific moment in time. Again, we get hints of that today through deterministic programming, but the ultimate application will be on-demand via generative AI. This may sound fanciful, but then again, I wrote in early 2022 that generative AI would be the key to making the metaverse viable: In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs. That may have also sounded fanciful at the time, but it’s already reality: just yesterday Google DeepMind announced Genie 3; from their blog post: Today we are announcing Genie 3, a general purpose world model that can generate an unprecedented diversity of interactive environments. Given a text prompt, Genie 3 can generate dynamic worlds that you can navigate in real time at 24 frames per second, retaining consistency for a few minutes at a resolution of 720p. […] Achieving a high degree of controllability and real-time interactivity in Genie 3 required significant technical breakthroughs. During the auto-regressive generation of each frame, the model has to take into account the previously generated trajectory that grows with time. For example, if the user is revisiting a location after a minute, the model has to refer back to the relevant information from a minute ago. To achieve real-time interactivity, this computation must happen multiple times per second in response to new user inputs as they arrive… Genie 3’s consistency is an emergent capability. Other methods such as NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting also allow consistent navigable 3D environments, but depend on the provision of an explicit 3D representation. By contrast, worlds generated by Genie 3 are far more dynamic and rich because they’re created frame by frame based on the world description and actions by the user. We are still far from the metaverse, to be clear, or on-demand interfaces in general, but it’s stunning how much closer we are than a mere three years ago; to that end, betting on current paradigms may make logical sense — particularly if you dominate the current paradigm — but things really are changing with stunning speed. Apple and Amazon’s risk may be much larger than either appreciate. Genie 3 is, as I noted, from Google, and thinking about these paradigm shifts — first the shift to mobile, and now the ongoing one to AI — has made me much more appreciative and respectful of Google. I recounted above how the company did what was necessary — including overhauling Android to mimic iOS — to capture its share of the mobile paradigm; as we approach the three year anniversary of ChatGPT, it’s hard to not be impressed at how the company has gone all-in on relevancy with AI. This wasn’t a guarantee: two months after ChatGPT, in early 2023, I wrote AI and the Big Five, and expressed my concerns about the company’s potential disruption: That, though, ought only increase the concern for Google’s management that generative AI may, in the specific context of search, represent a disruptive innovation instead of a sustaining one. Disruptive innovation is, at least in the beginning, not as good as what already exists; that’s why it is easily dismissed by managers who can avoid thinking about the business model challenges by (correctly!) telling themselves that their current product is better. The problem, of course, is that the disruptive product gets better, even as the incumbent’s product becomes ever more bloated and hard to use — and that certainly sounds a lot like Google Search’s current trajectory. I’m not calling the top for Google; I did that previously and was hilariously wrong. Being wrong, though, is more often than not a matter of timing: yes, Google has its cloud and YouTube’s dominance only seems to be increasing, but the outline of Search’s peak seems clear even if it throws off cash and profits for years. Meanwhile, I wasn’t worried about Apple and Amazon at all: I saw AI as being a complement for Apple, and predicted that the company would invest heavily in local inference; when it came to Amazon I was concerned that they might suffer from not have an integrated approach a la Google, but predicted that AI would slot in cleanly to their existing cloud business. In other words, exactly what Apple and Amazon’s executives are banking on. I wonder, however, if there is a version of this analysis that, were it written in 2007, might have looked like this: Nokia will be fine; once they make a modern OS, their existing manufacturing and distribution advantages will carry the day. Microsoft, meanwhile, will mimic the iPhone UI just like they once did the Mac, and then leverage their app advantage to dominate the lower end of the market. It’s Google, which depends on people clicking on links on a big desktop screen, that is in danger. I don’t, with the benefit of having actually known myself in 2007, think that would have been my take (and, of course, much of the early years of Stratechery were spent arguing with those who held exactly those types of views). I was, however, a Google skeptic, and I’m humble about that. And, meanwhile, I have that 2023 Article, where, in retrospect, I was quite rooted in the existing paradigm — which favors Apple and Amazon — and skeptical of Google’s ability and willingness to adapt. Today I feel differently. To go back to the smartphone paradigm, the best way to have analyzed what would happen to the market would have been to assume that the winners of the previous paradigm would be fundamentally handicapped in the new one, not despite their previous success, but because of it. Nokia and Microsoft pursued the wrong strategies because they thought they had advantages that ultimately didn’t matter in the face of a new paradigm. If I take that same analytical approach to AI, and assume that the winners of the previous paradigm will be fundamentally handicapped in the new one, not despite their previous success, but because of it, then I ought to have been alarmed about Apple and Amazon’s prospects from the get-go. I’m not, for the record, ready to declare either of them doomed; I am, however, much more alert to the prospect of them making wrong choices for years, the consequences of which won’t be clear until it’s too late. And, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms.

Title: MNTN Reports Strong First Earnings, Touts New AI Creative Tools

$68.5 million: MNTN’s total revenue for the second quarter, up 25% year-over-year. Nearly 4,000: The number of advertisers currently using MNTN’s technology, according to CEO Mark Douglas. “That rate is increasing at over 1,000 a quarter,” he added. 97%: The percentage of MNTN’s new (as of 2025) customers that had never advertised on TV before using the platform. $69.5-70.5 million: How much the company expects to make in the third quarter. 77%: MNTN’s gross margin, up from 70% in Q2 of 2024. That represents a 700 basis point improvement, the company said, largely due to MNTN’s decision to spin off Ryan Reynolds’ creative agency, Maximum Effort. Ahead of its first earnings call, MNTN saw a spike in stock price that took it to almost double the $16-per-share value it debuted at on May 21, dropping only slightly after yesterday’s earnings call. While Douglas didn’t offer an explanation for the dip, he pointed to the overall positive trend of the company’s stock prices as evidence of investors’ confidence in MNTN’s proposition: to give small- and midsized businesses access to performance-based CTV advertising. Douglas also claimed that the growth MNTN saw this quarter—85% uptick in active performance TV customers—is sustainable for the foreseeable future. “There are just a significant number of small- [and] midsized businesses,” he told ADWEEK. “We’re bringing them into the TV realm, and the rate at which are doing that is accelerating—we think it’s actually sustainable for quite a while.” He pointed to Meta, which made $46.6 billion in ad revenue in Q2 from millions of advertisers. The company is also piloting generative AI tools that help advertisers create TV ads, Douglas said. “We’re already generating thousands of AI-generated ads—over 1,000 customer-facing and 18,000 test ads,” he said. MNTN plans to officially launch the product later this year, which Douglas expects will make it easier for smaller advertisers to create 30-second TV spots at a significantly cheaper rate. MNTN expects to be able to continue to increase its gross margin following a significant jump in the past year, targeting growth between 75-80% in future quarters. “We’re sitting at 77% for the quarter, and that’s a quarter in which we didn’t have [Maximum Effort] and the creative costs, so that that’s a significant reduction,” Patrick Pohlen, MNTN’s chief financial officer, told investors during the call. By cutting hosting and media costs over the next few quarters, Pohlen expects MNTN will continue to improve on gross margin, he said. Kathryn Lundstrom is Adweek's sustainability editor.

Companies have reported mostly strong second-quarter earnings so far, but there are some specific takeaways investors should be aware of. So far, 82% of companies that have reported results have beaten estimated. According to FactSet, if that percentage holds, it will represent the highest percentage of quarterly earnings beats since the third quarter of 20221. Earnings will continue rolling in over the coming weeks, with tech titan Nvidia set to report at the end of August. Until then, here are some key insights from the last results: What happened: Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both reported earnings for the second quarter on Tuesday, with mixed results. AMD beat on revenue, but missed earnings estimates slightly. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.48, a hair below the expected $0.49 a share. Lisa Su, AMD's CEO, said the firm's AI revenue declined on a year-over-year basis largely due to US export restrictions, which have prevented AMD from selling its MI308 AI chip to China. Shares were down as much as 8% on Wednesday. Super Micro, meanwhile, missed slightly on both earnings and revenue. The chipmaker said revenue came in at $5.76 billion, below the expected $5.89 billion, and earnings per share came in at $0.41, below the $0.44 Wall Street expected. The miss was partly fueled by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, Charles Liang, the CEO, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. Shares of the chipmaker were down 17% after the results. What it means: AI chip manufacturers are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. That's expected to remain a key concern as the US irons out the details of its trade relationship with China. The US and China have until August 12 to strike a trade deal before higher tariffs kick in, another headwind that could rattle the market and semiconductor stocks in particular. "Industry-wide tariff impact is only now being felt and could result in headwinds for the entire semiconductor industry," Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, wrote in a note. What happened: McDonald's beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, but voiced concerns about the health of lower-income consumers and the ability of Americans to keep spending. The fast food franchise said revenue came in at $6.84 billion for the quarter, above the $6.7 billion analysts expected. Earnings per share came in at an adjusted $3.19, above estimates of $3.15. "Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical," Chris Kempczinski, the CEO, said on the company's earnings call, adding that low-income Americans were more likely to visit the chain than other income groups. "This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the US consumer." What it means: Consumer spending is in focus for retail giants and for Wall Street, given the cumulative effects of inflation in recent years and Trump's tariffs. Economists say tariffs could stoke inflation, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties to consumers. For now, though spending remains fairly strong, even as concerns have risen recently around a pullback among both high and low-income households. What happened: Palantir blew past estimates for second quarter earnings. The data software firm revealed that its revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, reflecting a 55% year-over-year increase. Shares popped as much as 10% after its results, bringing the stock up 130% year-to-date. What it means: The AI trade is alive and well, with firms still benefitting from the hype for artificial intelligence. Wedbush Securities called Palantir the "Messi of AI" in a note to clients shortly after the firm reported earnings. In a separate note, analysts lifted their price target for the stock to $200 a share, implying 15% upside from current levels. "Palantir remains one of our top tech names to own in 2025 and this deal represents another opportunity for PLTR to capitalize on while continuing to generate unprecedented traction for its entire portfolio across the federal and commercial landscapes," analysts said. What happened: Microsoft and Meta both beat on earnings last week. Microsoft took in $76.4 billion in revenue and $3.65 in earnings per share, above estimates of $73.8 billion and $3.37 a share. The company also joined the $4 trillion club for the first time as its stock surged following its earnings report, with shares up 26% year-to-date. Meta, meanwhile, took in $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 in earnings per share, above estimates of $44.83 billion and $5.89 a share. The stock is up 27% year-to-date. What it means: Mega-cap tech is still dominating the market. Tech was best-performing area of the S&P 500 in July, with the sector up 5% in the month. The Nasdaq hit 14 record highs in July, causing Deutsche Bank to declare that "tech-ceptionalism" has resumed for the market. The strong outperformance of large-cap stocks accelerated, further widening the gap between small-cap peers. "We continue to favor US large cap Tech over its small cap counterpart, as it takes a highly speculative market (i.e. 2021) or Big Tech to fall out of favor (i.e. 2022, Q4 2024) for the latter to outperform," Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of the research firm DataTrek, wrote in a note.

While headlines still frame AI and automation as "emerging," behind the scenes, corporations are already replacing humans at a massive scale—without a grand announcement, without public debate, and often, without employees realizing until it's too late. This isn't a prediction. It's a real-time labor displacement strategy playing out across global supply chains, stores, warehouses, and offices. These aren't isolated incidents. This is industrial restructuring at global scale, driven not by AI fear—but by efficiency, uptime, and Return On Investment. It can: Companies aren't framing this as layoffs. They're calling it: But the result is the same: fewer people. More machines. Lower cost. Unlike past automation waves, this one affects: What makes this dangerous is that it's: Here's the path forward—because while AI can be disruptive, it can also be empowering, if we move with clarity and purpose. Yes—AI is replacing jobs. But the real danger isn't just that AI is accelerating. It's that too many people still think they're safe because no one's told them otherwise. This article is your warning. But more importantly—it's your rallying cry. You are not helpless. You are not obsolete. But you do need to move. Now. Because AI isn't waiting for anyone. And the smartest companies and professionals? They're already building what comes next. © 2011 - 2025 eLearning Industry

August 06, 2025 10:38 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024, and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. $NSSC #Napco Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI) If you have held Treace Medical Concepts (NASDAQ: TMCI) shares continuously since prior to May 8, 2023, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the Company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost you. Visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, or contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com or call 267-507-6085 to learn more. Why? A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, contact us at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. #Treace $TMCI Attorney Advertising Disclaimer Contact:Joshua H.

Title: Why BlackRock’s 2.5K BTC and 101K ETH sell-off has traders on edge

Is BlackRock selling or preparing for something else entirely? BlackRock has transferred large amounts of BTC and ETH to Coinbase amid significant outflows from its crypto ETFs, sparking sell-off concerns. In a surprising move that has stirred fresh speculation in the crypto market, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, appears to be unloading a portion of its Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] holdings tied to its crypto ETFs. According to blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock transferred 2,544 BTC and 101,975 ETH to Coinbase Prime on the 5th of August. Such transfers are often interpreted as precursors to redemptions, especially when investor sentiment turns cautious. Naturally, these transfers coincided with noticeable outflows from BlackRock’s ETFs on the 4th of August. According to SosSo Value data, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, recorded a significant net outflow of $292.21 million, while its Ethereum counterpart, ETHA, witnessed an even higher outflow of $374.97 million. However, despite the large-scale redemptions, ETHA still managed to increase its Ethereum holdings to a value of around $9.3 billion, bringing its total net assets to approximately $10.7 billion. The outflow-inflow dynamics also shifted slightly on the 5th of August. While IBIT recorded another $77.42 million in outflows, ETHA saw a turnaround with $88.8 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Importantly, not all these movements may translate to direct market selling. Since the SEC approved in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs, firms like BlackRock can redeem ETF shares for actual crypto, reducing pressure on spot prices. This reduces the need to liquidate positions into cash, offering a more crypto-native mechanism for handling redemptions. Meanwhile, at the time of the sell-off, Ethereum was trading around the $3,700 mark. However, as of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, ETH has slipped to $3,637.32, at press time, reflecting a 0.76% decline in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin also saw a modest drop, trading at $114,145.54, down 0.22% over the same period. These shifts align with broader market jitters, which appear to have been sparked by a recent hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report. The report noted, “Inflation remains somewhat elevated.” As expected, this had signaled the potential for sustained high interest rates, prompting U.S. investors to adopt a risk-off approach and potentially triggering the outflows observed from BlackRock’s crypto ETFs.

Title: Why CQRS and Event Sourcing Are Gaining Ground in High-Concurrency Web Systems

Time Published: 2025-08-06T14:00:09Z
Full Content:
MichaelHilliard, 2025-08-06 In web app development company boardrooms, architects and engineers are debating old assumptions. Scaling up isn’t just about faster servers or better caching anymore. It’s about reshaping how systems think. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing are no longer fringe ideas. They’re becoming default choices in high-concurrency systems where consistency, auditability, and performance are non-negotiable. This article doesn’t aim to preach. It exists to explain why these patterns are being adopted, how they work in practice, and where they help solve problems that traditional CRUD-based models keep tripping over. Most developers start with CRUD. It feels intuitive. You create a user, update a record, delete a row. But under load, CRUD systems stretch. When a high volume of concurrent reads and writes hits the same storage, contention begins. Worse, every new feature adds a new write path. Data models balloon with flags, booleans, and optional fields. Business logic hides in service layers. You end up with one model doing too many things. And in distributed systems, this lack of separation multiplies the pain. CQRS and Event Sourcing flip this model. At its core, CQRS says: don't read and write with the same model. A Command updates the system, such as when a user submits an order, changes a password, or adds a product to the cart. These go through a write model. A Query asks the system, 'Show me the order history and get the latest stock count.' That goes through a read model. Separating them has consequences: In high-concurrency systems, this means fewer locks, faster reads, and clearer logic paths. In most systems, state is stored as current values. A user's balance is just a number in a column. With Event Sourcing, state is the result of a series of events. Each deposit, withdrawal, and fee is recorded as an immutable event. To know the balance, you replay the events. This approach brings: When combined with CQRS, your writes produce events, and your reads project those events into models optimized for access. Let’s say you’re building a web-based logistics app used by hundreds of agents updating package statuses every few seconds, while another team is running queries on shipping time averages across regions. With traditional models, these reads and writes compete. Locking, version conflicts, and long-running queries slow everything down. CQRS decouples the two. Writers update the system without interfering with readers. Readers get precomputed views that are updated via events. The result: lower contention, faster response times, and a system that scales horizontally. Event Sourcing, meanwhile, gives you a timeline. When a shipment shows an incorrect status, you can trace exactly how it happened. No need for logs. The data is the log. This isn't a silver bullet. CQRS and Event Sourcing introduce tradeoffs. Even Git is an event-sourced system. Every commit is an event. The current state is a projection. NEventStore and Marten (C#): Useful in .NET stacks for event-based architectures. More teams are now building their own lightweight versions of CQRS and ES without full-stack frameworks. This makes sense for web apps that want the architectural benefits without the lock-in. With CQRS and Event Sourcing, you test behavior, not just state. Did the correct event get produced from the command? Did that event create the expected read model projection? This encourages better domain modeling. Your codebase becomes a journal of behaviors, not just side effects. Debugging means walking the event stream. Many teams now keep tooling to replay and inspect events. This improves incident response. For high-concurrency systems, eventual consistency is often a requirement, not a limitation. Having strongly consistent reads in all cases adds latency and blocks scaling. By designing with eventual consistency in mind, you're treating the system as a distributed one from day one. That means using patterns like: These aren't hacks. They're best practices in systems where throughput matters more than instant state convergence. Traditional systems age badly. You retrofit audit logs, struggle with GDPR requests, and fight schema changes. Event-sourced systems age with grace. You can replay state with new rules. You can build new read models from old data. You can answer questions no one thought to ask before. That’s why technical leads at scale-focused companies are leaning toward these patterns. They help future-proof without pausing product growth. Ask yourself: If yes, CQRS and Event Sourcing aren’t overkill. They’re strategy. But if you're still building MVPs or handling low traffic, the overhead might slow you down. The right move isn’t to blindly adopt CQRS and Event Sourcing. The right move is to learn how and where to use them. There’s a reason these patterns are catching on. They speak to the challenges high-concurrency systems face daily, including data contention, auditability, and operational resilience. It’s not about being clever. It’s about making things clear, testable, and fast. The shift isn’t theoretical anymore. It’s happening, one event at a time. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.

Title: Nintendo just raised the price on Switch 2 Pro Controller again, but you can land a deal on one right now from $75 (Reg. $90)

Nintendo just hiked the price up on the popular Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller once again. After being announced at $80 back in April before jumping up to $85 ahead of launch, it just saw its MSRP rise again to $90 as part of Nintendo sweeping price hikes that just went live over the weekend. After going out of stock at most major retailers shortly thereafter, you can once again score a “deal” on one at $84.99 via Amazon and even less than that if you’re a Costco member. Again, the price is now officially $90 on the Switch 2 Pro Controller – one of the most popular Switch 2 accessories anywhere. This price is now reflected directly on the Nintendo Store as well select major retailers online (where you can find it in stock). However, anyone can go score one on Amazon right now for $84.99 shipped, which is indeed the launch price but is now $5 under the price of the new MSRP. There’s no telling how long a controller that might not actually see a deep deal for a year or perhaps even more will even be available at this price. Just keep in mind, that if you’re already a paid Costco member, you can score it for even less. Costco already had a deal on the Switch 2 Pro Controller running at $74.99 for more than a few weeks now, but its listing remains impervious to price hikes and is still sitting down at the lowest price we have tracked in brand new condition at retail. Now, the cost of the membership just to score the deal likely isn’t worth it, unless you plan on actually making use of the yearly sub, but for folks already invested in the warehouse box store, this is the best deal around. Nintendo recently announced and put into place price hikes across the previous-generation Switch 1 hardware and it has now taken effect on a number of the Switch Online controllers as well as the Switch 2 Pro Controller and the Switch 2 Joy-Con – the complete details on all of this awaits right here – and it is perhaps only a matter of time before the price jumps land on Switch 2 consoles as well.

Data from SoSoValue shows sell-offs across all U.S. funds tracking Bitcoin's spot price hit a total of $196.18 million on Tuesday. However, this is less severe than in recent days. Outflows stood at $333.19 million on Monday, while Friday's figure of $812.25 million was the second-highest since these products launched back in January 2024. Altogether, the four days of outflows have meant a net loss of $1.4 billion for Bitcoin funds. It comes as Donald Trump ramps up the rhetoric on tariffs once again, with threats of fresh levies on India, as well as imported pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. The renewed threat of trade wars has fueled risk-off sentiment among investors, with growing economic uncertainty prompting many to seek safer ground. Bitcoin is holding steady at $114,000 at the time of writing—relatively flat over the past 24 hours—but has fallen by 2.8% over the past week. According to SoSoValue, the picture looks slightly rosier when it comes to the Ethereum ETFs trading on Wall Street. Funds tracking the spot price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency actually saw inflows of $73.3 million on Tuesday. That snapped a two-day losing streak, with outflows of $465 million and $152 million on Monday and Friday respectively. Prior to that, ETF ETFs had enjoyed inflows for 20 days on the bounce, driven by a dramatic surge in price. Analysts are suggesting that the arrival of ETFs has had a significant impact on Bitcoin's volatility. Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas recently argued that BTC has jumped by 250% since BlackRock's initial filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, but without "vomit-inducing drawdowns." This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns.

Title: Xbox Is An Increasingly Unstable Platform For Anyone To Invest In

Constantly shifting motivations and tumultuous overhauls have poisoned the well of Xbox's ecosystem. By Moises Taveras on August 6, 2025 at 6:42AM PDT Xbox is going through an identity crisis. The most recent wave of layoffs at Microsoft, which cut about 9,000 jobs including numerous positions at studios under the Xbox banner, suggests as much. These cost-cutting measures are said to be in the service of some realignment or reorganization that's always purported to set up these companies for greater success. And yet they keep happening, further eroding any trust and goodwill the brand may have built up from previous successes. After several waves of job cuts, restructurings, pivots in strategy, and any other corporate jargon I've neglected to mention, I'm beginning to suspect that Xbox's growing instability deserves more scrutiny and concern from its developers and consumers alike. Let's be direct: The journey that Xbox has been on over the last decade appears to be a failure. Its famous spree of purchases and the subsequent management of its studios has churned out about as many blemished games as it has delays, cancellations, and studio closures. That isn't to say Xbox hasn't produced hits and gems, but along the way there, Xbox has also built up quite the track record of critically panned games, cancelled projects, and defunct teams.

By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy enter Now Playing: Xbox Studio Closures Are Confusing | Spot On No matter the aspect that you place under the microscope, Xbox is clearly bleeding through the bandages it keeps applying. Take a glimpse at the stable of teams at Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft's internal publishing division. Its most recent layoff resulted in the closure of at least one team under the banner, The Initiative, and the cancellation of its game Perfect Dark. Turn 10, one of its stalwart developers on the Forza franchise, has been reportedly cut to the bone. Rare, which was working on Everwild while maintaining the live-service title Sea of Thieves, is invariably in a worse position on the other side of the layoffs than it was before. The brunt of the damage from moves like these falls on the affected teams and their workers, and it's a disappointingly common move for Xbox, which has done this at least once before when a similar reorganizing shuttered four teams in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. These closures came within a few short years of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda. Another layoff followed shortly after the completed purchase of Activision Blizzard, cutting several jobs across its teams and leading to the cancellation of a survival game at Blizzard. The fact remains that bringing Bethesda's tremendous portfolio of megaton hits like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls in-house, as well as Activision Blizzard (and mobile developer King), should've stemmed the bloodloss, but Xbox's hemorrhaging and proclivity for retail therapy only seemed to worsen with each purchase. Anything else suggests the reckless endangerment of an entire industry. These moves should've uniformly led to greater stability for developers under the Xbox banner and a greater deal of games on the platforms. They didn't. Some studios, like Obsidian, have miraculously flourished under these conditions, producing new franchises and hits in existing ones, solidifying its place in Xbox's crumbling hierarchy of studios. Others, like Arkane Austin, haven't been as lucky. And gamers and developers alike suffer when that's the case. If everyone's going through it, who exactly is benefitting from Xbox's continued vision--or lack thereof? The motivation behind many of these purchases is an obvious one: Game Pass. Since its launch in 2017, the subscription service has been Xbox's biggest talking point, and as the years have passed, it has grown into the single biggest driver for engagement with the gaming division. Following the Xbox One's opening fumbles and hurdles, Microsoft devised a silver bullet that could rebuild its ecosystem and assure its biggest and smallest games had an audience. The service has even paid for the development of independent and third-party titles, making it a lifeline to some. But Game Pass has been a pain to grow despite its occasional surges, and its continued upkeep remains costly despite Xbox's claims that the service is profitable, with some major caveats. As a result, Xbox has even transformed Game Pass for the worse, introducing tiers that sell greater benefits for high-paying subscribers, all the while stripping access to portions of the expansive game library from members at the lowest levels. This move is a sharp reversal of Game Pass' earliest promises to connect gamers to the breadth of the console's titles. What once was often touted as the best deal in gaming has now become so diluted that it is now more anti-consumer than its original incarnation. Another line crossed. And though Game Pass funds the development of a number of projects, and still does, many developers have spoken up about how Game Pass has actually hurt their teams and titles. Mike Rose of the indie publisher No More Robots has been pretty open in the past about how Game Pass can assure a huge launch audience, which is great for teams struggling to find players, but also noted how the team's games would see little change in sales after being on the service. Instead, it typically got spikes just as it was entering the subscription service. Raphael Colantonio, founder of Arkane and later Wolfeye Studios, has become one of the service's biggest critics, recently opining that it is an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money.'" An isolated incident would be one thing, but grievances like Colantonio's have continually cropped up over the years, even if there are other stories that cite Game Pass as instrumental to a game's success. The evidence points to a concerning trend in the Xbox camp that doesn't appear to be going anywhere, and the more it's left as-is, the more likely it seems that developers will have to make a tough decision about their futures in Microsoft's ecosystem. Of course, it's hard to prove either side is wrong or right due to the fact that Microsoft obscures any numbers that could illuminate or disprove these arguments--numbers that Bloomberg's Jason Schreier refers to as "squishy metrics" subject to the whims of "dark accounting wizardry." This means that teams looking for a publishing deal with Xbox simply need to take the company at its word when evaluating whether Game Pass is the right move for their game and their business. But what good is that word with the uncertainty that has persistently hung over Xbox's motivations and decisions for much of the last decade? Is it worth it to take that opportunity and fund that game if the near-future of your team continues to hang in the balance? Doesn't Xbox owe its developers more than false promises of stability once they join the Game Pass service considering how impactfully it can hurt a team's bottom line? Doesn't it owe the same kind of dependability to its subscribers? I feel that answering these questions requires more foresight than I've observed from the brand. After all, this is the gaming giant that settled on the multimedia-heavy approach to the Xbox One that crippled the console out of the gate, and then took away Xbox users' ability to purchase and own digital movies and TV shows recently. It's also the company that settled on an "Everything is an Xbox" marketing campaign that deemphasized the system itself after giving up so much ground to its contemporaries. The campaign isn't an affront itself, but when paired with the worsening Game Pass service, which is how the company can afford to turn smart TVs, Amazon Fire Sticks, and even your PC into an Xbox, the rottenness of the tactic becomes more apparent. Xbox's direction seems to pivot with the wind, and it means that the consumers who buy into its products, as well as the engineers who make them, and the developers that then work to give them value, constantly feel like they're sold up the river for the next big thing that the company does. I don't feel answers coming any time soon. If the latest layoffs are any indication, Xbox's path forward is set in stone, and whatever may come of it has already been deemed worthy of the sacrifice it took to to be realized. As Christopher Dring of The Game Business succinctly puts it, the Xbox we knew is dead. And with it is any semblance of faith this industry and culture can muster for it.

Title: 'Bond King' Bill Gross made millions betting against GameStop. He says the stock is behaving like bitcoin now.

Bill Gross says he's steering clear of the latest crop of meme stocks for now, despite making millions of dollars betting against GameStop and AMC in the past. The billionaire investor told Business Insider he had "no interest" in Opendoor, Kohl's, American Eagle, and other stocks whose prices spiked as buzz on Reddit and other social media spurred retail traders to pile in. Day traders have Microsoft and Meta "to play with for now," Gross said. The tech titans are up 30% and 25% respectively this year because of AI excitement. Gross — known as the "Bond King" for growing fixed-income titan PIMCO's flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly 30 years — said the stock that started it all, GameStop, is "not behaving like a meme" and is "much less volatile" than before. He added that he still viewed it as a "good candidate for option selling." Gross said the stock "seems to mimic bitcoin," the most valuable cryptocurrency, known for its volatility and passionate fanbase. Bitcoin's price fell by a quarter between early January and early April this year, but has rallied to record highs of above $110,000. GameStop announced its first bitcoin purchase in late May, securing 4,710 tokens worth around $537 million at current prices. Adjusted for a stock split in 2022, GameStop soared from around $1 in the summer of 2020 to a peak intraday price of $121 on January 28, 2021. It has traded within a much tighter range of around $20 to $35 over the past 12 months. It followed a similar trajectory to bitcoin by rising sharply in the fourth quarter of 2024, slumping this spring, and rebounding through early June. However, GameStop then fell after disappointing first-quarter earnings and dilutive share sales, whereas bitcoin kept climbing to fresh highs in July. Gross bet against GameStop by selling call options at the height of its meme-stock surge in January 2021. An options contract gives the buyer the right to purchase or sell a stock at an agreed price within a set period. Sellers wager these contracts will expire worthless, and they can simply keep the premium paid by the buyer. Gross was $15 million in the red, losing sleep at one point as GameStop kept climbing, but he doubled down. He later said he made between $15 million and $20 million betting against GameStop and AMC. "I knew I had an advantage over Reddit and the boys," Gross has said about his original meme-stock wagers, as he had access to real-time options and volatility data on his Bloomberg terminal. Gross has been a vocal skeptic of meme stocks for years, calling them "lottery tickets" and describing buyers of overpriced options as "fish at the poker table." He's also said that each buying frenzy ends with a "musical chair, me-first exit" from the stock. Besides GameStop and AMC, Gross also sold put and call options on Trump Media in the spring of 2024 to cash in on the craze around the president's stock.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration NEW YORK : Apollo agreed to buy a majority interest in Stream Data Centers (SDC), the alternative asset manager said on Wednesday, in a bet on rising demand for digital infrastructure fueled by artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Big Tech companies and outside investors are pouring money into data centers as demand for computing power soars. The physical sites for computing machines and other hardware could require spending of up to $6.7 trillion worldwide by 2030, consultancy McKinsey estimates. SDC builds, leases, manages and operates huge campuses. It has delivered more than 20 to date and has a pipeline of projects with "multi-gigawatt" capacity, Apollo said in a statement. Apollo is betting that so-called hyperscalers - large cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google - will continue to rely on outside developers to find the land they need to build data centers, get regulatory approvals for it, and secure sources to cover their vast power needs.

Title: ‘Defending Paradise’: Julia Louis-Dreyfus Takes on Big Oil in California
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/julia-louis-dreyfus-oil-offshore-drilling-exxon-california-1235400793/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Antonia Juhasz Julia Louis-Dreyfus has three words for the nation’s political elite: “Grow a set.” The acclaimed actress is best known for playing iconic women, from Elaine Benes in Seinfeld, to Vice President Selina Meyer in Veep, and diabolical CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the new Avengers movie, Thunderbolts*. Louis-Dreyfus is also a longtime environmental and political activist. She has made it her personal mission to get California Governor Gavin Newsom, President Donald Trump, and every other political leader she can wrangle to understand that oil drilling is for suckers — and protecting our climate and the economies that thrive off of a healthy and sustainable environment is the stuff of true patriotism. It is not always an easy sell. Seated in her Santa Barbara, California, home with her dog Georgie vying for her attention — I fail to ask if he’s named after that George — it is clear that Louis-Dreyfus is pissed off. “The idea of this decrepit pipeline that failed so miserably and catastrophically a decade ago, the idea of that restarting is an impossible thing to contemplate, and it really has to be fought,” she tells me via Zoom. A decade ago, one of the worst oil disasters in California’s history occurred not far from Louis-Dreyfus’ home. On May 19, 2015, a massive, corroded oil pipeline ruptured, releasing 140,000 gallons of heavy crude oil onto Santa Barbara’s Refugio State Beach. Oil poured into one of the most biologically rich areas of the Pacific Ocean, a key habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, sea otters, sharks, and more than 500 fish species. It was carried down the coast past Los Angeles, oiling 150 miles of beaches and coastline. In June 2015, I walked the beach at the Santa Monica pier, 100 miles from Refugio. A fresh line of thick and pungent oil tar balls — some as large as a hand — lined the sand along the tideline, with new oil from the spill deposited with incoming waves. The spill devastated fisheries, tourism, and areas sacred to the native Chumash peoples. Then-Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, deploying the state’s Attorney General Kamala Harris. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century The oil came from ExxonMobil’s offshore operations. For 10 years, the people of Santa Barbara have successfully kept ExxonMobil from restarting those operations, including the ruptured pipeline. Resistance has been led by Louis-Dreyfus’ friend and ally, Linda Krop, chief counsel of Santa Barbara’s small but mighty Environmental Defense Center. I first interviewed Krop in 2015 just after the spill. She described watching aghast, the stench nauseating, as thick heavy waves of oil filled the ocean and poured onto Refugio Beach. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” she told me. “It was just devastating.” Last month, Krop and I walked along the same stretch of beach. Children played in the ocean and teenagers took surfing lessons, enjoying a healthy and beautiful shoreline. Krop is committed to keeping it this way. For 10 years, Krop and her allies have beaten ExxonMobil in the state legislature, the federal government, and in court battles stretching all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. “This project is the single largest threat to California’s coast,” Krop tells me.

Website ‘Glitch’ Removes Trump's Least Favorite Part of Constitution But now the entire project is poised to restart, with both state and federal agencies granting many of the necessary permits. It is fronted by a new company funded and backed by ExxonMobil — Sable Offshore Oil Corp, which is behaving with what many here describe as a “Trumpian” and “unprecedented” disdain for the law, under the hopeful eyes and dedicated support of the Trump administration. It would be the first newly started oil development off California’s coast in decades, and the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the county. The project could also usher in Trump’s plan to open the entire Pacific coast (and nearly all federal waters) to oil and gas drilling. “President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” Trump’s Interior Department said in a statement last week, crowing that “we’ve turned a decade-long shutdown into a comeback story for Pacific production.” In response to detailed questions, an ExxonMobil spokesperson says that the company completed the sale of these operations with Sable more than a year ago, and passed me off to Sable for additional information. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop are committed to stopping Trump. They are also clear that the final say on Sable’s project ultimately rests not with Trump but with Newsom, who they argue is failing to act. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says of the governor. “This is far from over.” On March 13, Louis-Dreyfus joined legendary actress and activist Jane Fonda for a press conference at the Environmental Defense Center in opposition to Sable’s project. Louis-Dreyfus then addressed a packed house of more than 500 people who filled the La Cumbre Junior High School in Santa Barbara for a town hall on Sable. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop were the final speakers, following presentations by representatives from nine state agencies with jurisdiction over Sable’s project. Krop warmly introduced Louis-Dreyfus as a “local shero” and “a champion of fighting the fossil fuel industry and trying to protect the climate, our way of life, and a clean and healthy environment.” Louis-Dreyfus has a decades-long history of environmental and political activism. For her podcast, Wiser Than Me — just named one of the best podcasts of all time by TIME magazine — she interviews older women, including giants like labor leader Dolores Huerta, conservationist Jane Goodall, and acclaimed marine biologist Sylvia Earle, who are “brimming with the kind of unapologetic attitude and wisdom that only comes with age.” She was a staunch supporter of both Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris’ presidential campaigns against Trump. Last year, she moderated a forum of Democratic women governors and introduced the event as “what J.D. Vance might call a coven of semi-menstruating witches.” But for Louis-Dreyfus, the fight against Sable is uniquely personal. Her husband was born and raised in Santa Barbara, where his family has lived for generations. Her family previously split their time between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, but that was before their L.A. home was destroyed in the Palisades fire early this year. “The climate crisis is obviously real and upon us — it’s not coming, we’re living it right now. That was certainly felt by me during these devastating fires,” Louis-Dreyfus tells me. “Santa Barbara is a paradise worth defending and protecting,” she adds, explaining that the risk of this oil project “is very close to home… and something that is not possible to turn my back on.” Louis-Dreyfus looked resolved as she approached the podium, scanning the sea of bright red T-shirts worn by the project’s opponents reading, “Don’t Enable Sable,” and the hundreds of competing hats emblazoned with Sable’s logo that were worn by the pipeline’s supporters. Confronting the obvious tension in the room, she leaned into the mic, stared down the audience, and said, “I smell a rat.” “I am here because I’m a resident of Santa Barbara County,” she began. “And this project is a rat.” She pulled no punches, describing the pipeline 10 years ago as “crap” and the people responsible for supervising it as irresponsible. “Thankfully, the whole decrepit thing was shut down,” she said. “But now, Sable Oil from Texas is trying to restart the very same, dangerously inadequate pipeline that ruptured. And incredibly, they’re trying to do it with zero environmental review and zero opportunity for public input. That is insane. It makes me furious. I know it makes you furious.” She called the project a catastrophe waiting to happen. As Louis-Dreyfus spoke, the audience erupted in applause and hoots of support, though there were some jeers and boos, too. The Sable supporters then rose and began filing out of the auditorium en masse. Unfazed, she continued on, calling out Sable for ignoring cease-and-desist orders issued by the California Coastal Commission and for behaving as “an incompetent operator trying to grease the wheels of government.” She declared, “We’re not going to let this happen without a fight,” adding: “I will certainly fight for my home.” “Sable Offshore management, employees, contractors, labor and supporters showed up today in good faith to participate in a town hall meeting where only government officials were on the agenda to present,” Sable vice president, Steve Rusch, told the Santa Barbara news outlet Noozhawk. “Project opponents forced the moderators to give them dedicated time to present biased information and smear the project. The opponents’ self-serving fundraiser and rally was not an appropriate use of public resources.” Louis-Dreyfus later tells me that she was surprised when Sable’s supporters walked out on her, and she wishes they’d stayed. “I was speaking truth to power pretty forcefully… and so they got pissed off,” she says. “I felt emboldened by it, to be honest. It was fuel, the good kind of fuel.” Krop says that Louis-Dreyfus’ speech was significant to those in the audience. “You could feel it in the room,” she said. “It was the kind of support people needed to hear.” Krop has spent the better part of the last 40 years at the Environmental Defense Center. Working with a team of just 11 full-time staff, she has relentlessly and successfully gone head-to-head against the world’s largest corporations, cutting Exxon off in every effort to restart its Santa Barbara operations, and helping create some of the nation’s most powerful environmental and public health laws as a result. The nation’s first offshore oil drilling began in Santa Barbara in 1896. In 1969, it was also the site of what remains one of the nation’s worst oil disasters, when a blown-out well operated by Union Oil Company released 3 million gallons of oil into the ocean. The Environmental Defense Center was one of many local organizations born in the aftermath to protect the community from fossil fuels. Under the banner “Get Oil Out!” local organizers spawned a wave of activism credited with birthing the national environmental movement and achieving a series of legislative victories, including the federal National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and the California Coastal Act of 1976. They quickly won a ban on any new offshore oil and gas leasing or drilling in California state waters. In 1982, Congress followed suit, implementing a series of similar moratoria primarily off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Despite Congress and President George W. Bush allowing the federal moratoria to expire in 2008, no new fossil fuel leases have been granted in state or federal waters outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska in decades due to staunch public opposition. The offshore oil and gas operations taking place today off the Pacific coast — all of which are offshore California — were grandfathered in; they were already underway when the bans and moratoria were imposed and were allowed to continue. “No one ever dreamed that they would still be here today,” Krop tells me. The oil from the existing operations was expected to quickly dry up. Instead, the companies developed new techniques to keep their grandfathered operations running decades longer than anyone anticipated. ExxonMobil signed its first lease for the Santa Ynez Unit offshore Santa Barbara in 1968 and began production in 1981. Santa Ynez includes three platforms in federal waters named Harmony, Heritage, and Hondo, supported by pipelines that connect the platforms to shore and on to the Los Flores Canyon Processing Plant. ExxonMobil was able to greatly extend the life of its grandfathered platforms using drilling technologies learned from its operations in Russia, according to a 2010 ExxonMobil press release. It achieved “the world’s longest extended-reach well” at Santa Ynez, extending over six miles horizontally and more than 7,000 feet below sea level. Horizontal drilling is a technique used in fracking, using water and chemicals to blast open rock to release oil and gas. ExxonMobil revealed in a 2017 court filing that the Santa Ynez wells also require acid well stimulation treatments to keep producing; acidization uses acid to dissolve the rock. Both techniques release toxic chemicals into the environment that are harmful to humans and wildlife. In 2022, the Environmental Defense Center and the Center for Biological Diversity won a lawsuit, begun nearly a decade earlier, that effectively bans fracking and acidizing from offshore oil and gas wells in the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a plea from ExxonMobil the following year to review the case, allowing the ban to stand. At the time of the 2015 oil spill, ExxonMobil’s oil and gas was carried from the Las Flores Canyon Processing Plant along the Pacific Coast Highway in an underground pipeline that was owned and operated by the Plains All American Pipeline company. When this pipeline ruptured, the oil entered a culvert which carried it directly into the Pacific Ocean and onto Refugio Beach. Federal regulators found that Plains had allowed the pipeline to corrode to such an extent that the thickness was reduced in places from 24 inches to just 1/16 of an inch. California’s then-Attorney General Kamala Harris secured a grand jury indictment of Plains on 46 criminal charges, including four felonies. The Department of Transportation ordered the pipeline shut down, which is how it has remained ever since. Without the pipeline, ExxonMobil had no way to carry its oil to buyers and thus had no way to sell it, forcing the company to also halt production from its offshore oil and gas wells. ExxonMobil spent nearly a decade trying to secure permission to move the oil by truck, ultimately losing (again) to Krop. Companies are also barred from using tankers to move their oil offshore California. During his first administration, Trump tried and failed to open virtually all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Under pressure from the fossil fuel industry — led by its largest lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute — he’s now trying to do it again. “You cannot make offshore oil safe, and the Trump administration is trying to ramrod more offshore oil down our throats,” Krop tells me. Back in 2018, Krop helped secure state legislation prohibiting California from issuing new leases for any oil or gas-related infrastructure such as pipelines in the state’s coastal waters that would support federal operations, which also cut ExxonMobil off from building new pipelines to carry its oil to shore somewhere else. The state has also taken additional actions against ExxonMobil. In 2023, Newsom sued ExxonMobil along with Chevron, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and the American Petroleum Institute, accusing the fossil fuel industry of lying to the public for decades about its products’ central role driving the climate crisis, and demanding payment for the resulting harm. Newsom is also suing ExxonMobil for engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception that caused and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis. ExxonMobil is counter-suing California and several environmental organizations for allegedly “engaging in a deliberate smear campaign” by conspiring to defame the company. Not long after the climate suit was launched, ExxonMobil announced its intention to exit California and promptly sold its onshore operations. Ditching its California holdings could potentially shield ExxonMobil from the state attempting to seize Exxon’s assets if California wins its climate suit and if Exxon were to refuse to pay any resulting damages. Announcing its departure meant that Exxon could no longer count the value of its offshore oil and gas leases as part of its reported earnings. In 2023, it had to take a $3.4 billion earnings cut due to its idled Santa Ynez Unit (the entirety of its offshore California holdings). Selling the operations removes this loss from Exxon’s balance sheet. In 2024, Exxon financed the sale of its Santa Ynez operations and all related onshore facilities, including the ruptured pipeline, to Sable Offshore Oil Corporation. Exxon loaned Sable $623 million, nearly the entire amount required to fund the sale. Though the sale is complete, the handover is not. Exxon and Sable are currently suing Santa Barbara County for its refusal to transfer certain permits from Exxon to Sable. But, other than its gas stations, ExxonMobil now has no remaining significant holdings in California. ExxonMobil is likely playing the long game. While the company is for all intents and purposes being forced out of California, it also has an obsequious and acquiescent ally in Trump and his administration, which is simultaneously trying to undermine and undo climate and environmental actions taken by the state. Trump’s efforts are expected to cost American jobs and increase energy prices for consumers, including significantly raising gas prices at the pump. “Sable is ruthless, they are absolutely horrible,” Mia Lopez tells me. Lopez is a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, the first human inhabitants of the Central Coast of California. Refugio State Park is located near the original site of the historic Chumash village of Qasil. Just three days before the 2015 oil spill, Lopez was elected chair of her tribe. “It was so devastating, to our land, our sites, the ocean, the artifacts, so many things that were damaged,” Lopez tells me, pain gripping her face. “It affected our relatives in the ocean, so many birds, seals, dolphins, and whales. That’s my community. Those are my relatives. That’s who I became responsible for.” Lopez stepped down as chair in 2021, but explains, “I just realized there’s no way I can ever step away from this fight against the oil.” She has helped lead efforts to hold the companies accountable and keep the projects from reopening ever since. “They have proven from the moment they stepped in that they are untrustworthy. They have blatantly disregarded laws and regulations,” Lopez says of Sable. Sable Offshore Oil Corp. was formed in 2021 by a group of men who have worked together for years heading small oil and gas companies, including companies with ties to the Santa Barbara oil spill. Santa Ynez is Sable’s only operation — and the only operation ever undertaken by the company. James Flores is chairman and CEO (his son is president of the company). Flores’ previous company, Sable Permian Resources, filed for bankruptcy in 2020 (recovering the following year). From 2001 to 2013, Flores served as the chairman and CEO of Plains Resources, Inc., a company formed in 2001 when it broke off from Plains All American Pipeline (the owner and operator of the failed pipeline found guilty of causing the 2015 oil spill). Flores also served as chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, which currently operates several inactive platforms off of Santa Barbara’s coast. Sable is in a race against time: Exxon gave Sable just two years to either pay back its entire loan with interest or give back the assets. “It doesn’t have time to get a whole new pipeline approved and built, so it aggressively pursued restart of the old, corroded pipeline,” Krop explains. “No one thought this pipeline would ever be used again.” Sable immediately set to work, receiving permits from state and federal agencies, but without a key permit from the California Coastal Commission, an independent state regulator established under the California Coastal Act. Sable contends that it does not need the permit; the commission asserts that it does. The two sides are currently fighting it out in court, with a hearing set for October. The commission has issued several cease-and-desist orders, which Sable ignored, and leveled an $18 million fine, the largest in its history, alleging months of illegal violations of the Coastal Act. “This is the first time in the agency’s history that we’ve had a party blatantly ignore a cease-and-desist order,” Cassidy Teufel, deputy director of the California Coastal Commission, said at the March town hall at which Louis-Dreyfus also spoke. “Sable representatives have told us that they’ll only stop if a court makes them.” Louis-Dreyfus sees Sable as following the Trump playbook. “Following the rule of law all of a sudden seems to be up for grabs, and our country is based on rule of law,” she says. Teufel said that Sable has identified more than 100 locations where the pipeline was defective that are within the coastal commission’s auspices. The company brought in heavy equipment to excavate, destroying and disrupting sensitive habitats and protected areas, including federally designated critical habitat for wildlife protected under the Endangered Species Act, and within sensitive stream corridors and wetlands, all without a permit and in apparent violation of the law, he said. Lopez watched in anguish as the work unfolded, taking place 24 hours a day, seven days a week, primarily carried out by hundreds of temporary contractors. Sable has just 161 employees, none of whom are unionized. “They did not have permission to dig in our lands. They did not have permission to dig up our sites. They did it under the cover of darkness. They did it without seeking the proper permits,” she tells me. “I watched them dig, and there was nothing we could do about it.” In response to questions from Rolling Stone, Sable shared a statement from its vice president, Rusch, asserting that the company’s work to “ensure the safe condition of the pipeline” was “fully authorized by coastal development permits” and accusing the commission of exaggerating the project’s impact, “which were de minimis thanks to Sable’s implementation of best management practices.” The company further states that it “implemented several construction best practices to limit impacts” to coastal, biological, and archaeological resources. “The project is supported by employees, small businesses and community leaders like the tribal leader of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation,” Sable spokesperson Alice Walton wrote in the email, attaching a statement written in October by then-tribal chief, Gabriel Dominguez Frausto. Walton did not mention that this statement was promptly voided by the Tribal Council and Frausto was forced to resign, having “overstepped his authority by responding without Tribal Council or membership approval.” In a subsequent letter, the new tribal chief and the Tribal Council stated their “unequivocal opposition” to the project, “and to any further or continued oil development on our homelands and within our coastal waters.” On May 19, the 10-year anniversary of the oil spill, Sable announced that it had restarted production at Santa Ynez, completed its repair program on the onshore pipeline, and expected to “recommence oil sales in July.” A class action lawsuit alleges that Sable committed securities fraud or other unlawful business practices based on these claims, misleading investors to inflate its stock price just before a major stock offering. It cites the California State Lands Commission, which says that Sable conflated offshore well testing with the restart of operations, appearing to “mischaracterize the nature of recent activities, causing significant public confusion and raising questions regarding Sable’s intentions.” In the strongly worded letter, commission chair and Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis accused Sable of a willful disregard for the directives of state regulatory agencies and threatened to withhold its leases, calling the company “Exxon’s designated operator.” A few days later, the Superior Court of Santa Barbara sided with the Coastal Commission and ordered Sable to stop any further coastal work until it obtains the necessary permits. Despite these warnings and several ongoing legal battles, in Sable’s most recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 11, the company said that it continues to produce from the Santa Ynez Unit, anticipates receiving approval to restart the pipeline, and would begin selling oil on August 1 (it has not). Six days after the filing, hedge fund Encompass Capital Advisors announced its purchase of over 5.2 million shares of Sable, representing over 5.2 percent of the company’s stock. In June, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, reported acquiring over 5 million shares of Sable, representing 5 percent of its stock, according to an SEC filing. Sable has not and cannot restart the pipeline until it receives final approval from state and federal regulators. It did not answer questions from Rolling Stone as to whether it has secured buyers for its oil if the pipeline does restart. Sable has also gone on offense, hiring Exxon’s lobbying firm, Crossroads Strategies, to lobby the federal government and Platinum Advisors to lobby in Sacramento. Platinum’s clients include the California Business Roundtable and the Plastics Industry Association, as well as progressive groups, including the SAG-AFTRA actors union. Krop is suing on several fronts, including charging state regulators with illegally issuing a key waiver to Sable. She and Louis-Dreyfus are also calling on Newsom to put a halt to Sable’s project once and for all. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says. She applauds Newsom’s forceful response when Trump sent the National Guard and Marines into Los Angeles. “I’m hoping that the same speaking-truth-to-power that he exhibited then will now be applied to this fight.” “The governor’s office could have prevented all of this,” Professor Paasha Mahdavi, Director of the Energy Governance and Political Economy Lab at the University of California in Santa Barbara, tells me. “Newsom’s office could have just killed this upfront.” Governor Newsom declined a request for an interview. In an emailed statement, a Newsom spokesperson says, “While some offshore drilling continues in federal waters under longstanding federal leases, the governor remains unwavering in his commitment: no new offshore drilling — period.” The governor’s office stresses the necessity of allowing the legal and regulatory process to play out. It disputes Sable’s predictions of a rapid completion timeline, instead asserting that any conclusion is likely far off given multiple barriers in the regulatory landscape to Sable restarting the pipeline, including in the coastal commission’s case. Newsom has taken an aggressive stand against Trump, including the administration’s efforts to open all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Trump’s Department of Transportation has also recently proposed weakening federal oil and gas pipeline safety regulations and speeding up approvals for new pipelines. Many fear that allowing Sable to restart Exxon’s offshore operations will provide Trump with the opening his administration is looking for to assert that Californians support and even condone offshore drilling, and that the door should be open for more. Krop wants Newsom to publicly oppose Sable’s project, citing the risks of another massive oil spill and climate change. She wants him to commit state agencies to conducting environmental reviews and public hearings. “We’re at the tail end of this project potentially being approved and given the green light,” Krop warns. “It’s time for Newsom to act.” Trending Stories BET Hip Hop Awards and Soul Train Music Awards Have Been ‘Suspended’ Indefinitely Treasury Secretary Admits Trump’s Tariffs Are Paid by Americans How ‘Clanker’ Became the Internet’s New Favorite Slur Jailed by Trump’s ICE, Children’s Hospital Chaplain Was Thrown Into ‘Solitary’ Louis-Dreyfus joined what was likely the largest protest in Santa Barbara’s history in June as more than 10,000 people participated in the No Kings national day of protest against Trump. The mood in Santa Barbara was joyous and defiant as people stood side-by-side in a mile-and-a-half-long line, their backs to the Pacific Ocean, in a visual blockade against Trump.

Title: This ‘Isn’t Priced In’—SEC Reveals Radical ‘Project Crypto,’ A Bitcoin Price Game-Changer

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has limped into August following a sudden sell-off that even a jaw-dropping intervention by legendary billionaire Ray Dalio couldn’t reverse. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen under $112,000 per bitcoin this last week, down from a peak of $123,000 in July (though traders are bracing for a fresh BlackRock earthquake). Now, as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar, bitcoin and crypto traders have been warned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) newly unveiled “Project Crypto” isn’t priced in. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “The most bullish document I’ve read on crypto wasn’t written by some yahoo on Twitter. It was written by the chairman of the SEC," Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise, wrote in a note posted to X after SEC chair Paul Atkins published a speech he gave on July 31 at the America First Policy Institute about how crypto will be integrated into the financial markets. “I was caught off-guard by the speech," Hougan wrote, adding: "I can’t imagine reading the speech and not wanting to allocate a significant portion of your capital to crypto. If it wasn’t priced in for me, I’m going to guess it wasn’t priced in for others.” The bitcoin price had already surged following the resignation of former SEC chair Gary Gensler in January, climbing again when Atkins was sworn in by U.S. president Donald Trump in April. Last week, Atkins, picked by Trump to replace the crypto critic Gensler, unveiled Project Crypto, a radical plan to carve out a niche for crypto in U.S. securities laws and embed blockchain technology into the financial system. The SEC’s new Project Crypto initiative marks the "boldest and the most transformative crypto vision ever laid out by a sitting SEC chair," analysts at research and brokerage company Bernstein wrote in a note seen by The Block. "As Atkins puts it, the winds of change are blowing," Bernstein’s Gautam Chhugani wrote. "In our view, Project Crypto upends the concept of a regulatory moat in capital markets, allowing equal opportunity to new players to participate and innovate in security markets. It is time to upgrade the financial system from online to onchain." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious In the speech, titled "American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution: Evolution of Capital Markets—From Buttonwood to Blockchain," Atkins claimed U.S. financial regulation must evolve or risk being left behind. “That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the [President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets] recommendations," Atkins said. “Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and 'Operation Chokepoint 2.0.’ Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate.” Crypto companies began complaining of banks withholding services from them in a way that felt like it was coordinated in 2022. Nic Carter, a crypto venture capitalist, then coined the term Operation Choke Point 2.0, referring to an Obama administration clandestine operation to debank undesirable industries including firearms dealers and payday lenders in the early 2010s. Since retaking the White House, Trump—who has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year—has promised to dismantle Biden-era restrictions of crypto markets and companies, calling himself the first “crypto president.”

Business FILE PHOTO: The sun rises behind skyscrapers and offices of the City of London financial district in London, Britain, May 5, 2022. REUTERS/Toby Melville//File Photo LONDON/FRANKFURT :Buyout company Hg has begun lining up advisers to explore a possible sale of its financial data firm FE fundinfo, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, following on from a series of deals in the highly valued sector. The London-based FE fundinfo could generate around 70 million pounds ($93.2 million) in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation this year and could fetch more than 20 times this in a sale. That would make it worth more than 1.4 billion pounds, one of the sources said. All three sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private. They said no final decision had been taken and preparations were at an early stage. Although they expected Hg to proceed with an auction towards the end of the year, the timeline could slip into next year.

Title: Rocket Lab expands iQPS satellite network with successful Electron launch
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_expands_iQPS_satellite_network_with_successful_Electron_launch_999.html
Time Published: 2025-08-06T11:31:23Z

The mission, titled 'The Harvest Goddess Thrives,' lifted off from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 04:10 UTC on August 5. A single SAR imaging satellite, QPS-SAR-12 - nicknamed KUSHINADA-I after the Japanese harvest goddess - was deployed into a 575 km circular orbit. This was Rocket Lab's fourth iQPS mission this year and the fifth overall, reinforcing Electron's position as the primary vehicle for building out the constellation. "Every Electron launch is a demonstration of payload deployment precision for our customers - an especially critical element when scaling satellite constellations," said Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Today's fifth and flawless deployment for iQPS once again underscores Electron's reliability and continues to prove that consistent tailored access to space is a reality on Electron for our customers." iQPS CEO Dr. Shunsuke Onishi added: "Building a satellite constellation requires both timely development and manufacturing, as well as highly precise launch execution. We are deeply grateful to both our team and the Rocket Lab team for their continued dedication in making this possible. As the number of satellites increases, so too does the frequency and value of the data we are able to provide. We will continue to accelerate our efforts to ensure that our satellite data can be leveraged in even more fields and applications." This mission was Rocket Lab's 11th Electron launch of the year, with four additional iQPS launches planned through the rest of 2025 and into 2026. Details of the next Electron mission are expected soon.

Hess Midstream has declared a significant share repurchase programme involving the buyback of $100m in shares, including $30m of class B units from its sponsor, an affiliate of Chevron, and $70m of class A shares from the public. The repurchase of class B units is being conducted by the company’s subsidiary, Hess Midstream Operations. The board of directors of Hess Midstream’s general partner unanimously approved the terms of the unit repurchase transaction following a recommendation from its conflicts committee, which is composed solely of independent directors. This move is expected to result in increased distributable cash flow per class A share, providing the potential for incremental distribution growth above Hess Midstream’s annual target. Furthermore, Hess Midstream has entered an accelerated share repurchase agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, to repurchase $70m of its publicly traded class A shares. The securities acquired through these transactions will be cancelled upon settlement, which aligns with Hess Midstream’s strategy to enhance shareholder value and supports its commitment to a minimum of 5% annual distribution growth through 2027. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Hess Midstream CEO Jonathan Stein said: “We continue to execute repurchase transactions as part of our ongoing financial strategy, which prioritises return of capital to our shareholders. “Following these repurchase transactions, we expect to continue to have more than $1.25bn of financial flexibility through 2027 for incremental shareholder returns, including the potential for further unit and share repurchases over this period.” In a related development, Hess Midstream announced in May the pricing of its secondary public offering of approximately 15.02 million class A shares at $37.25 each, which are being sold by an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of BlackRock. The offering is expected to generate gross proceeds of around $559.59m, with an expected closing date of 30 May 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Hess Midstream will not receive any proceeds from this offering.

Title: DoorDash is worth $100 billion thanks to dominating U.S. restaurant delivery. A much larger opportunity is starting to come into view
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/doordash-food-delivery-acquisitions-business-expansion-tony-xu-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. As DoorDash reports its latest financial results on Wednesday, it’s clear that the 12-year-old company has dominated the restaurant delivery wars in the U.S. over Uber Eats and Grubhub, owning somewhere around two-thirds of the market thanks in part to its prescient move into the suburbs that was supercharged by COVID-19 lockdowns. That market lead alone has encouraged investors to bid up its stock price to more than $250 a share and a market cap north of $108 billion as of Tuesday. All told, DoorDash shares have more than doubled over the past year. And considering that DoorDash finished 2024 with its first-ever annual profit, the San Francisco–based company led by cofounder Tony Xu appears well positioned to continue thriving in the U.S. food delivery business. But if you look at DoorDash’s investment and M&A activity this year, you’ll see signs of a company that has quietly laid the foundation for a much grander ambition beyond restaurant delivery in the U.S. And if it’s successful—still a big if—DoorDash will someday be known as much more central to the technological fabric of restaurants and other local retailers around the globe than it is today. In May, the company announced a double whammy of two proposed acquisitions: one, a nearly $4 billion deal for Deliveroo, which would give DoorDash a top three meal delivery business in the U.K., and a combined presence in more than 40 countries—with the intent of turning DoorDash’s core restaurant delivery operation into a truly global one. (DoorDash previously acquired Finland-based Wolt in 2022 for around $8 billion in an all-stock deal.) The other acquisition was a $1.2 billion deal for the hospitality software company SevenRooms, which makes software products aimed at helping restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality businesses manage bookings, reservations, and their customer relationships. The decision to buy SevenRooms was led by Parisa Sadrzadeh, a former rising star at Amazon whose mandate when hired at DoorDash last year was to expand the company’s suite of software tools, called DoorDash Commerce Platform, that helps brick-and-mortar restaurants and retailers grow and manage their businesses inside their physical locations in addition to any delivery operations. “While DoorDash solved a massive problem for merchants during the pandemic … introducing a delivery capability to many who had never considered doing it before,” Sadrzadeh told Fortune in May, “[another] challenge ended up being, ‘How do you grow my actual volume in my physical store, because those are my most profitable consumers?‘” Weeks after announcing the pair of May acquisitions, DoorDash continued the buying spree by announcing a $175 million acquisition of the advertising technology startup Symbiosys, which is designed to help brands and retailers who advertise on the DoorDash app also reach DoorDash customers on other platforms around the web. DoorDash said that its ad business crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2024. Online advertising businesses have increasingly become key profit engines for online retailers and marketplaces. While DoorDash doesn’t break out financial results for its ad business, analysts have estimated that it carries a much larger profit margin than its core delivery business. In the background, DoorDash has continued to aggressively go after other types of consumer spending, too, signing delivery partnerships with retailers big and small across grocery, pharmacy, pet, sporting goods, and alcohol categories as well. Taken together, DoorDash is laying out an ambitious vision—it’ll take time to judge if it’s too ambitious and distracting or as prescient as its suburban delivery move—to become a much more comprehensive technology player for restaurants and other brick-and-mortar retailers across the globe. At the same time, even with a market cap of $100 billion–plus, the company still has potential for considerable growth within its core business of restaurant delivery in markets around the world. “If you took our oldest area of exploration, U.S. restaurants … we’re still single-digit percentages of the U.S. restaurant industry sales,” CEO Xu said on an earnings call earlier this year. “If you look at globally, that number would be even smaller.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Colleen DeCourcy retired from advertising once. She’s not doing it again
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/08/06/colleen-decourcy-retired-advertising-once-she-s-not-doing-it-again
Time Published: 2025-08-06T10:58:00Z
Full Content:
Advertisement August 6, 2025 | 13 min read Listen to article 4 min Artificial intelligence is reshaping the ad industry at breakneck speed. In agencies around the world, creatives are contemplating an uncertain future, fearful that their job will be lost to a machine. If you’re fortunate to have enjoyed a 40-year career in advertising – to have worked on some of the most iconic campaigns for the biggest brands in the world and earned numerous accolades along the way – you might think it’s the perfect time to bow out. Why not enjoy the spoils and avoid the painful, challenging, frustrating (and, yes, perhaps exciting) process of adapting to a new reality? Well, just ask Colleen DeCourcy. She first announced her retirement from the industry in 2021, leaving Wieden+Kennedy a legend after almost a decade in leadership. Then, she was lured back into the industry for the top creative job at Snap. As she prepares to become a grandmother (“a nanna”), to twins no less, she decided to leave the tech giant. But she’s also decided that she isn’t ready to hang up her hat. The very thing that’s terrifying creative leaders might be the thing that keeps her in the industry. Sitting down with The Drum at the Cannes Lions Festival, she says: “Creative people, by their very nature, are worriers, and when you’re tasked with your core competency being to defend ideas in every situation possible, change is always frightening. But I do fundamentally believe that what’s at risk [with AI] is not creativity. What’s at risk is the size of the margins of the businesses that built things out to wrap around creativity. So I’m excited about what’s coming.” I had arranged to meet DeCourcy for a quick coffee at a nearby cafe after her appearance on the Palais main stage, where she interviewed Google DeepMind CEO Mustafa Suleyman – a divisive figure in creative circles. In front of a packed audience, she confronted the thorny subject of AI’s looming threat to the industry with unflinching honesty. Now, upon arriving for our rendezvous, a French waiter, comically irate just two days into the festival’s chaos, curtly tells us we can’t sit unless we eat. Seeing the panicked look in my eyes as I realize I won’t be able to scoff a croque monsieur before my next interview, DeCourcy winks and says she and her partner (Jason, joining her at Cannes for the first time) would gladly eat at what was a less-than-ideal spot when surrounded by endless gourmet options to allow us to finish the interview. “I’m not sure that I am going to retire this time,” she says mid-order, as if it’s just occurred to her. “I think it’s just about setting different boundaries. It’s very different to be – I’m going to say it because I think this industry can be ageist – 60 years old. I know who I am. I have the ability to set terms on how I want to work and look around to find things that are super exciting to me. Operationalizing an agency through Covid and a massive protraction of the industry… after all that, I said I was ready to retire as I couldn’t imagine [being at] an agency that wasn’t Wieden+Kennedy. And what’s happening for me now is that I can imagine applying my creativity to things that aren’t agency, right? Snap allowed me to figure that out.” DeCourcy is one of advertising’s most celebrated creatives, in large part because of her willingness and even comfort with working at the messy intersection of technology and creativity. She entered advertising in 1986 at Saffer Cravit & Freedman, briefly detoured into media and entertainment, and then returned in 1994. After stints at Spafax, Organic and JTW New York, she ended up at TBWA Worldwide as its first-ever chief digital officer, where she was at the sharp end of figuring out how clients should think about then-emerging platforms like MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. Those experiments in social media pushed her to start her own social media content and design shop, Socialisit, in 2011. But two years later, the big call came. Within 15 months of arriving at Wieden+Kennedy as creative director, DeCourcy had been made a partner, joining an exclusive club that included Dan Wieden, president Dave Luhr and Susan Hoffman. It was the fastest anyone had made partner at the agency, and she went on to become its co-president and chief creative officer, working on campaigns for clients ranging from Nike and McDonald’s to Airbnb and Meta along the way. She also launched its tech and innovation lab, The Lodge, in 2013, where she encouraged creatives to think about how VR, AR and artificial intelligence could be applied to client briefs. Under her steerage, the global agency enjoyed one of its most successful eras, amassing 149 Lions at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Advertisement DeCourcy announced her retirement from advertising in 2021. But within a year, she was back to the grind as chief creative officer at Snap. This wasn’t in her plans. She has had conflicting feelings on Big Tech and the impact social platforms like Meta have on society. She “got in trouble”, she says, for an article in Time Magazine titled ‘Is it moral to have Facebook as a client?’ in which she admitted her fears about the giants’ influence. So how did she end up running the creative department at a billion-dollar platform? People she “really cares about” on the Snap board convinced her to meet with the CEO, Evan Spiegel, initially. “Ending up at Snapchat was directly related to [the Time Magazine article]. I spoke to him about his intentions. I looked at all the research on the impact of that platform. I don’t even want to go into all the details of why it’s different, but I will tell you, Snap is built to not do the specific things that I was so afraid of with social media. “When I joined, I felt I had an obligation to prove that. I can’t call something out and then go and wash my hands. People want to communicate through technology. Young people love social platforms. So the trick was to find one that’s not damaging and help it become essential. It wasn’t an incongruity. It was an intentional decision.” Unlike her tenure within agency walls, where she had been the instigator to embrace new tech, her role in a place already at the cutting edge was to prove the power of brand, storytelling and creativity. “There was no universe built around the sanctification of my creativity,” she says, reflecting on the three years she spent at the company. The big brand thinking, helping Snap work out its place and how it wanted to communicate that, was something she “could do in her sleep”. What was less easy was doing that at the “speed, the velocity” that Silicon Valley demands. Engineers wanted instant work promoting the latest update, Wall Street reacted to every launch, and the relentless news cycle influenced messaging daily. But the biggest culture shock from leaving the world of agencies, she says, was the removal of any friction. “Removing friction from agreement is how you move fast. And that’s not great for creative work. When I worked in an agency and we walked in to pitch ideas to a client, there were two bosses in the room, one on their side, one on our side. There was the CMO and me. And their team had to get me excited, and my team had to get the CMO excited. And we found a way to get there,” DeCourcy explains. “When you work in-house, the person paying you is also the person who wants this thing, and there’s very little allowance for friction. And it’s a tech company that moves at the speed of light. You can very easily start to make anodyne work that makes a lot of sense, but doesn’t break through, that isn’t scary.” She adds: “But I’m grateful it was Snap, and Evan, as there was some allowance, some space, for that.” Take its first Oscars TV spot, which ran in 2022. She tied the campaign to Best Picture winner Coda, the first film to star a predominantly deaf cast in leading roles, and worked with SignAll to develop Lenses that could help Snapchat users learn ASL. Its most recent ‘Less Social Media, More Snapchat’ campaign was the culmination of her efforts to assert Snap’s position, highlighting the fundamental differences between it and other social media platforms. Users had steadily grown during her time with the company, but as ever, the question of how to monetize them arrived. Internally, it became “a dead heat” on whether to continue to grow users or ad sales. And as the pendulum began to swing back to a focus on product and performance marketing, she knew her time at Snap had come to an end. “I knew it the second I reached the moment when it was time for a real marketer, not a creative director,” she says. “They’ll need someone like me again in the future. But that’s not what excites me. And Evan was gracious enough to hear that and be kind.” So, where does she go from here if she’s not ready to retire? Well, no one knows yet. Not even DeCourcy. The challenge facing agencies as they grapple with AI and how it will upend the business model is something we talk about at length. She has little sympathy for holding companies under the cosh as they face ever-tightening margins after decades of putting an expensive wrapper around their creatives. They brought in a “vast number” of people and charged for services layered on services, and that’s “what’s going away.” “What we do in defense is say it’s coming for creativity,” she says. “And I look at most of those places and think, as a creative, I was often one-third of the workforce, right? And it’s not coming for me. It’s not coming for us.” Advertisement DeCourcy believes the solution is to follow the lead of Jean Marie Dru and Lee Clow, who have long advocated for agencies to adopt a model that charges for big, share-price-moving ideas. Ideas like those she orchestrated for long-term client Nike while she was at W+K. The ‘Dream Crazy’ campaign was credited by some as driving a 5% increase in the retailer’s stock price. That’s the kind of big-picture, culture-defining work no AI model could conceive. “I have not been one who has ever been fearful of tech,” she says. “Now is a really interesting moment. We’ve seen it come for the industries around us, and if you sit in meetings at a sales level, and you listen to the kinds of things that are being said about what will happen with ads, it could be alarming for an agency. But then you realize what the long-term gainer of this thing is [for creatives]. And it really is exciting to me as a creative person, playing with the tools, to get ready for this.” As the surly waiter returns with her lunch, I leave with one final question.

Business FILE PHOTO: The Uber logo is seen on the rear window of a taxi, in Dublin, Ireland, June 29, 2025. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo Uber unveiled a $20 billion stock buyback program and forecast its third-quarter bookings above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, as the ride-hailing and delivery services company benefits from growing adoption of its paid loyalty program. The company said members for its $9.99 "Uber One" program jumped 60 per cent in June to more than 36 million from a year earlier, and more than one-third of its bookings were coming from them. These users are crucial for Uber as they engage with both its services, generating more than three times the profit compared to that from users who use just one service. To draw more people to the loyalty program, Uber held a week-long event in May that offered discounts and deals across rides, food delivery and groceries. The company added half a million users over the course of the week, Uber said on Wednesday.

Title: Máire Treasa Ní Cheallaigh: Employers hustling staff back to the office should look at their own performance first

As AIB and others push teams towards in-person working, management may be missing the point Are employers who are pushing for the return to office just blind to the difficulties in-person working presents? Photo: Getty I’m never surprised when I see company bosses and top-tier management try to make a case for returning employees to offices full-time, or for mandatory days where hybrid workers must attend. They enjoy a bustling office with them starring as the ringmaster. And it’s usually easy for them to be there. Imagine large city-centre offices in Dublin, Cork or Galway. The boss usually lives nearby in a place like Ballsbridge, Blackrock or Salthill. They often have a handy parking space for their company car right outside the door or, failing that, can afford convenient commercial parking. They don’t have to worry about being in the traffic, as they can come in whenever suits. They can nip out for a tasty lunch and perhaps even expense it. Going to work and seeing the gang beaver away is easy. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: More than 560 trespass incidents on Irish Rail network so far this year

Dublin Majority recorded in the greater Dublin area, latest figures show Irish Rail recorded over 560 cases of illegal access to tracks and stations in the first half of 2025. Pic: Stock image Dozens of people have been fined or prosecuted for trespassing on the Irish Rail network so far this year, with the majority of incidents recorded across the greater Dublin area. Figures released to Kildare North TD Aidan Farrelly reveal that 567 trespass incidents were reported to Irish Rail in the first half of 2025. The data, which includes outcomes for specific incidents, shows trespassing has occurred at key city centre stations – such as Connolly, Pearse, and Lansdowne Road – and commuter hubs including Maynooth, Bray, Blackrock, and Clondalkin/Fonthill. Most adults involved received fixed penalty notices, while in some cases, individuals were prosecuted or convicted in court. At Maynooth, one person was convicted and fined, with additional costs awarded. Several incidents remain unresolved due to those involved being minors, with details unverified or summonses unserved, particularly at locations including Sandymount, Salthill, and Malahide. The figures form part of a broader pattern of offences reported over recent years, with 985 incidents recorded in 2024, down from 1,102 in 2023 and higher figures in previous years. Trespassing on the railway is illegal and highly dangerous, carrying penalties under the Railway Safety Act 2005. Irish Rail has repeatedly warned of the fatal risks posed by people accessing live tracks or infrastructure without authorisation. A person who trespasses on railways is now liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,000, subject to increase under the Fines Act. Mr Farrelly, who requested the data, highlighted the concentration of offences within the greater Dublin area, but welcomed the overall decline. “These statistics suggest that the bulk of offences are happening within the greater Dublin transport network,” he said. “We appear to be seeing a declining trend in relation to trespassing, which is welcome. “It also appears that for those under age 16, it has been decided to inform parents/guardians rather than use statutory powers to sanction, which I believe to be appropriate,” he added. Concerns persist, however, as trespass-related safety risks remain a serious issue, especially amid ongoing passenger growth and the Dart+ expansion programme. Residents living close to railway infrastructure have previously highlighted safety problems, such as youths throwing rocks from rail viaducts in North Strand last November. Social Democrats councillor Daniel Ennis warned at the time that “someone was going to get killed”, and urged Irish Rail to improve site security and fencing. Irish Rail recorded over 560 cases of illegal access to tracks and stations in the first half of 2025. Pic: Stock image Today's News in 90 seconds - 6th August 2025 At the time, Irish Rail responded to the query, saying there was a “24-hour monitoring station continuously in place” and “repeated checks to Iarnród Éireann’s boundaries”. “Our Crime Prevention Officer has alerted An Garda Síochána and we are liaising with them to arrange additional patrols,” a spokesperson for Irish Rail said. “All train drivers are to report sightings of trespass, and our regional team will respond upon alerts. “Iarnród Éireann staff will continue to liaise with the community in these areas and will promptly address any breaches of boundary fencing or any incidents of trespass, and liaise with gardaí,” they added. Irish Rail and the Department of Transport have been contacted for comment. This article was amended at 10.45am on August 6, 2025, to correct TD Aidan Farrelly’s constituency as Kildare North Irish band Kingfishr has announced three headline gigs across the island of Ireland for summer 2026.

Meta tried to buy Mira Murati’s AI startup, Thinking Machines, and failed. Then Mark Zuckerberg made an aggressive play for its top talent, including co-founder Andrew Tulloch, with an eye-watering $1.5 billion offer. Tulloch said no. So did everyone else. This is the story of loyalty, culture, and ambition clashing with money and muscle in the escalating AI arms race.

August 05, 2025 22:07 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP informs stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025 and July 28 2025. Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company, focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical productions globally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Misled the Market About its 2025 Revenue and Profit Growth Potential According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Novo Nordisk's representations regarding its growth potential were overstated and failed to account for the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion; (2) defendants misrepresented the likelihood that patients using compounded GLP-1s would transition to Novo Nordisk's branded alternatives; and (3) Novo Nordisk significantly overstated both the size of the GLP-1 market and its ability to penetrate that market to sustain growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on "lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025" for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to "the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expectations and competition." On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk's common stock declined from $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Novo Nordisk A/S. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must submit their papers with the court by September 30, 2025. The lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses.

It's a necessity.

I have had two cars and I've had five and no one can complain.Housing is overpriced and it can crash for all I care. I'm not moving. I'm not going to complain about losing value. I'm probably going to die here in another fifty years if I'm lucky.I only hope it hurts the wealthy the most.

Things are kinda odd in Chicago at the moment.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Press Freedom Coalition to FCC: Don't Ditch Checks on Corporate Media Consolidation

Quality journalism. Progressive values. Direct to your inbox. Brendan Carr, chair of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, delivers a speech during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain on March 3, 2025. The 16 groups urge the agency "to uphold its obligation to promote competition, localism, and diversity in the U.S. media." A coalition of 16 civil liberties, press freedom, and labor groups this week urged U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to abandon any plans to loosen media ownership restrictions and warned against opening the floodgates to further corporate consolidation. Public comments on the National Television Multiple Ownership Rule were due to the Federal Communications Commission by Monday—which is when the coalition wrote to the FCC about the 39% national audience reach cap for U.S. broadcast media conglomerates, and how more mergers could negatively impact "the independence of the nation's press and the vitality of its local journalism." "In our experience, the past 30 years of media consolidation have not fostered a better environment for local news and information. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 radically changed the radio and television broadcasting marketplace, causing rapid consolidation of radio station ownership," the coalition detailed. "Since the 1996 act, lawmakers and regulators have further relaxed television ownership limits, spurring further waves of station consolidation, the full harms of which are being felt by local newsrooms and the communities they serve." The coalition highlighted how this consolidation has spread "across the entire news media ecosystem, including newspapers, online news outlets, and even online platforms," and led to "newsroom layoffs and closures, and the related spread of 'news deserts' across the country." "Over a similar period, the economic model for news production has been undercut by technology platforms owned by the likes of Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, which have offered an advertising model for better targeting readers, listeners, and viewers, and attracted much of the advertising revenue that once funded local journalism," the coalition noted. While "lobbyists working for large news media companies argue that further consolidation is the economic answer, giving them the size necessary to compete with Big Tech," the letter argues, "in fact, the opposite appears to be true." The letter points out that a recent analysis from Free Press—one of the groups that signed the letter—found a "pervasive pattern of editorial compromise and capitulation" at 35 of the largest media and tech companies in the United States, "as owners of massive media conglomerates seek to curry favor with political leadership." That analysis—released last week alongside a Media Capitulation Index—makes clear that "the interests of wealthy media owners have become so inextricably entangled with government officials that they've limited their news operations' ability to act as checks against abuses of political power," according to the coalition. In addition to warning about further consolidation and urging the FCC "to uphold its obligation to promote competition, localism, and diversity in the U.S. media," the coalition argued that the agency actually "lacks the authority to change the national audience reach cap," citing congressional action in 2004. Along with Free Press co-CEO Craig Aaron, the letter is signed by leaders at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians - Communications Workers of America, National Coalition Against Censorship, Local Independent Online News Publishers, Media Freedom Foundation, NewsGuild-CWA, Open Markets Institute, Park Center for Independent Media, Project Censored, Reporters Without Borders USA, Society of Professional Journalists, Tully Center for Free Speech, Whistleblower and Source Protection Program at ExposeFacts, and Writers Guild of America East and West. Free Press also filed its own comments. In a related Tuesday statement, senior economic and policy adviser S. Derek Turner, who co-authored the filing, accused FCC Chair Brendan Carr of "placing a for-sale sign on the public airwaves and inviting media companies to monopolize the local news markets as long as they agree to display political fealty to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement." "The price broadcast companies have to pay for consolidating further is bending the knee, and the line starts outside of the FCC chairman's office," said Turner. "Trump's autocratic demands seemingly have no bounds, and Carr apparently has no qualms about satisfying them. Carr's grossly partisan and deeply hypocritical water-carrying for Trump has already stained the agency, making it clear that this FCC is no longer independent, impartial, or fair."

"Since the 1996 act, lawmakers and regulators have further relaxed television ownership limits, spurring further waves of station consolidation, the full harms of which are being felt by local newsrooms and the communities they serve." The coalition highlighted how this consolidation has spread "across the entire news media ecosystem, including newspapers, online news outlets, and even online platforms," and led to "newsroom layoffs and closures, and the related spread of 'news deserts' across the country." "Over a similar period, the economic model for news production has been undercut by technology platforms owned by the likes of Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, which have offered an advertising model for better targeting readers, listeners, and viewers, and attracted much of the advertising revenue that once funded local journalism," the coalition noted. While "lobbyists working for large news media companies argue that further consolidation is the economic answer, giving them the size necessary to compete with Big Tech," the letter argues, "in fact, the opposite appears to be true." The letter points out that a recent analysis from Free Press—one of the groups that signed the letter—found a "pervasive pattern of editorial compromise and capitulation" at 35 of the largest media and tech companies in the United States, "as owners of massive media conglomerates seek to curry favor with political leadership." That analysis—released last week alongside a Media Capitulation Index—makes clear that "the interests of wealthy media owners have become so inextricably entangled with government officials that they've limited their news operations' ability to act as checks against abuses of political power," according to the coalition. In addition to warning about further consolidation and urging the FCC "to uphold its obligation to promote competition, localism, and diversity in the U.S. media," the coalition argued that the agency actually "lacks the authority to change the national audience reach cap," citing congressional action in 2004. Along with Free Press co-CEO Craig Aaron, the letter is signed by leaders at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians - Communications Workers of America, National Coalition Against Censorship, Local Independent Online News Publishers, Media Freedom Foundation, NewsGuild-CWA, Open Markets Institute, Park Center for Independent Media, Project Censored, Reporters Without Borders USA, Society of Professional Journalists, Tully Center for Free Speech, Whistleblower and Source Protection Program at ExposeFacts, and Writers Guild of America East and West. Free Press also filed its own comments. In a related Tuesday statement, senior economic and policy adviser S. Derek Turner, who co-authored the filing, accused FCC Chair Brendan Carr of "placing a for-sale sign on the public airwaves and inviting media companies to monopolize the local news markets as long as they agree to display political fealty to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement." "The price broadcast companies have to pay for consolidating further is bending the knee, and the line starts outside of the FCC chairman's office," said Turner. "Trump's autocratic demands seemingly have no bounds, and Carr apparently has no qualms about satisfying them. Carr's grossly partisan and deeply hypocritical water-carrying for Trump has already stained the agency, making it clear that this FCC is no longer independent, impartial, or fair." A coalition of 16 civil liberties, press freedom, and labor groups this week urged U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to abandon any plans to loosen media ownership restrictions and warned against opening the floodgates to further corporate consolidation. Public comments on the National Television Multiple Ownership Rule were due to the Federal Communications Commission by Monday—which is when the coalition wrote to the FCC about the 39% national audience reach cap for U.S. broadcast media conglomerates, and how more mergers could negatively impact "the independence of the nation's press and the vitality of its local journalism." "In our experience, the past 30 years of media consolidation have not fostered a better environment for local news and information.

Title: After OPEC’s Oil Supply Cuts, What Now?

More Info OPEC+ will complete the unwinding of its largest production cut next month after agreeing this weekend to boost output by 547,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September in a move that was widely expected by the market and oil industry analysts. What’s next for the OPEC+ oil production policy and the last remaining layer of production cuts of 1.66 million bpd is anyone’s guess. The group of OPEC and non-OPEC producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, left the door wide open to any further production adjustment – in either direction – and to all sorts of forecasts and analyses by market watchers and investment banks. The group of eight major OPEC+ producers agreed on Sunday, as expected, to continue with the rollback of the 2.2 million bpd cuts. This will see the alliance roll back all these cuts, and the UAE adding 300,000 bpd by the end of next month. The short-term strategy is clear. The strategy for after September—anything but. “The big question now remains whether prices can be sustained into the autumn months as global demand slows and Trump’s tariffs impact global trade,” analysts at Saxo Bank said in a note on Monday. Autumn Blues The OPEC+ producers cited “current healthy oil market fundamentals and steady global economic outlook” to justify the continued rollback of the output cuts, as they have been doing since early spring. The group is betting on peak summer fuel demand, but this will come to an end in September. Near-term fundamentals may be strong, but the market is bracing for a major surplus once the peak demand season ends. Related: Oil Drops as Markets Digest OPEC+ Supply Decision Current demand in the key crude-importing region, Asia, appears to be not as strong as OPEC+ suggests with every press release on its production policy. Crude oil imports into Asia fell in July to 25 million bpd, down from 27.88 million bpd in June, per data by LSEG Oil Research cited by Reuters columnist Clyde Russell. Asia’s July crude imports slumped to the lowest monthly level in exactly a year, according to the data. China is boosting imports, but it’s likely that these have been opportunistic purchases at lower oil prices when June and July-loading cargoes were arranged. Chinese refiners have been building up stockpiles in recent months, as it’s estimated that China has been adding just over 1 million bpd to its stockpiles so far this year. The volatile prices and the spikes in oil in June during the Israel-Iran war may have influenced buying for cargoes set to arrive in China in August and September, and these could be lower, due to the price hikes. Looking at fundamentals, the market appears to be headed to a glut in the fourth quarter of the year, analysts concur. “While OPEC+ policy remains flexible, we assume OPEC+ will keep its production quota unchanged after September as we expect the pace of builds in OECD commercial stocks to accelerate and seasonal demand tailwinds to fade away,” Goldman Sachs said earlier this week. The investment bank kept its oil price forecast for Brent crude, seeing the international benchmark averaging $64 over the fourth quarter of the year despite recent developments that have pushed both Brent and West Texas Intermediate higher than Goldman’s Q4 target. “We believe the group is finished with its supply hikes, as we move out of the stronger summer demand period and inventories start to rise,” ING commodities strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said on Monday. Geopolitical Upside The group hasn’t signaled any direction for after September, but the producers warned that the rollback of the cuts could be subject to change. “The phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions,” OPEC said. This leaves the market hanging and guessing which geopolitical or trade event could overshadow fundamentals and warrant a new OPEC+ intervention sooner than thought. The messaging from the latest meeting is “all options remain on the table — including bringing those barrels back, pausing increases for now, or even reversing the recent policy action,” Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg. The most immediate material change in market balances could be the U.S. seeking to choke off Russian supply to India and Turkey, if Putin lets the August 8 deadline to seek peace in Ukraine lapse without any action. Analysts assume that Russia and China will find a way to keep crude trade flowing after a short period of adjustment or deeper price discounts for Russia’s crude. India and Turkey are more vulnerable, and if they stop buying Russian oil, OPEC+ will have to tap into the last layer of 1.66 million bpd production cuts and return them to the market sooner than planned, which is by late 2026. President Trump is threatening he would be “substantially raising” the tariff on India as “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine.” “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,” President Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. The Trump Administration’s potential move to severely restrict Russian oil shipments could reduce and even erase the expected surplus on the market in late 2025. But it is uncertain how long President Trump’s campaign pledge “I’ll end the war in Ukraine on day one in office” will take and whether the U.S. will move to impose secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian oil. The Trump Administration wants low oil and energy prices, which would be inconsistent with hiking the barriers to Russian oil exports. Amidst all these geopolitical frictions and power plays, OPEC+ is watching and waiting for the right time to unwind the last remaining production cuts and reclaim market share lost to U.S. shale.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Gartner Stock Plunges; Palantir, Axon Surge After Earnings

Major U.S. equities indexes slipped on Tuesday after data revealed an unexpected downtick in the country's services sector in July, while traders monitored the latest developments on tariffs. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% on Tuesday, failing to extend its positive momentum from the trading week's opening session. The Dow slid 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.7%. Shares of the technology-focused research and advisory firm Gartner (IT) logged the S&P 500's weakest performance on Tuesday, plummeting nearly 28%. Although second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share topped estimates, Gartner reduced its full-year sales guidance, and its updated revenue outlook fell short of consensus expectations. The company cited soft demand within its insights segment—Gartner's largest research unit accounting for more than half of sales—as businesses moderate spending in response to the uncertain economic environment. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares dropped 21%. Despite beating top- and bottom-line estimates with its second-quarter results, boosted by sales growth from its treatment for cystic fibrosis, the biopharmaceutical company announced it would halt development on an experimental next-generation pain treatment that failed to reach its primary endpoint in a recent Phase 2 trial. TransDigm Group (TDG), a supplier of engineered aircraft components, missed sales and profit estimates for its fiscal third quarter. A disappointing performance from TransDigm's commercial original equipment manufacturing segment, which the company attributed to inventory destocking and sluggish build rates, weighed on the results. TransDigm shares tumbled 12%. Axon Enterprise (AXON) shares jumped more than 16%, rising the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the maker of the Taser and other law enforcement gear surpassed sales and profit estimates for the second quarter and lifted its full-year outlook. Strong growth in annual recurring revenue suggested that Axon is gaining momentum in its software business, and the firm has seen strong demand for its generative artificial intelligence products, including a tool that drafts an initial police report based on camera footage. AI software giant Palantir Technologies (PLTR) also increased its 2025 outlook after topping second-quarter sales and profit estimates, highlighting strong demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform as a key contributor to a record $1 billion in quarterly revenue. Following the strong results, analysts at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank raised their price targets on Palantir stock. Shares of the data analytics company surged 7.8%. Shares Leidos Holdings (LDOS) jumped 7.5% in the wake of the aerospace and defense contractor's quarterly earnings release. Adjusted EPS came in well ahead of expectations, while revenue edged out forecasts. Leidos noted an uptick in demand across its customer segments, with particular strength in its defense systems unit as geopolitical tensions remain elevated. Advances in the areas of AI and maritime autonomy also helped underpin the strong performance.

AMD Q2 2025 earnings showed a mixed performance—while profits stayed flat, revenue beat expectations thanks to booming AI chip demand. AMD reported $7.7 billion in revenue and projected a strong Q3 forecast of $8.7 billion, driven by growing sales of its MI300 and upcoming MI400 AI accelerators. Despite this, AMD stock dipped over 3% due to export concerns and high valuation pressure. Uncertainty around U.S. restrictions on AI chip sales to China remains a hurdle. Still, AMD is positioning itself as a strong player in the AI space.

US stock indexes slipped Tuesday following the latest discouraging signal on the US economy. The S&P fell 30.75 points, or 0.5%, to 6,299.19, coming off a whipsaw stretch where it followed its worst day since May with its best since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 61.90 points, or 0.1%, to 44,111.74. The Nasdaq composite fell 137.03 points, or 0.7%, to 20,916.55. A weaker-than-expected report on activity for US services businesses added to worries that President Trump's tariffs may be hurting the economy, the AP reports. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, along with a stream of stronger-than-expected profit reports from US companies, helped keep the losses in check. Palantir Technologies jumped 7.9% after the provider of AI platforms reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company also raised its forecast for revenue over the full year, and its stock climbed further after it had already doubled for the year so far coming into the day. "We continue to see the astonishing impact of AI leverage," CEO Alex Karp said. Axon Enterprise leaped 16.4% after the company, which sells Tasers, body cameras, and software to public safety departments, reported a much stronger profit than analysts expected. It also cited growth in its AI offerings, which can save time for transcriptions and other tasks, and raised its forecast for revenue this year.

On the losing side of Wall Street was American Eagle Outfitters, which dropped 9.5% to give back some of its 23.6% jump from the day before. Edgewell Personal Care, the company behind the Schick, Playtex, and Banana Boat brands, fell 18.8% after reporting lower profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Rod Little said it was a very weak season for sun care in North America, while tariffs are acting as a drag on profits. Yum Brands fell 5.1% after the company behind KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut reported results for the latest quarter that came up just short of analysts' expectations. Trade policy was one of the most common topics US services businesses talked about in the latest monthly survey compiled by the Institute for Supply Management about their activity. "Tariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies," one company in the health care and social assistance business said. "Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes." The ISM survey showed that US services activity flatlined in July, adding to the "stagflation" fears raised by the recent weak jobs report, CNBC reports. Copyright 2025 Newser, LLC.

U.S. stock indexes slipped following the latest discouraging signal on the U.S. economy NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes slipped on Tuesday following the latest discouraging signal on the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, coming off a whipsaw stretch where it went from its worst day since May to its best since May.

But increased hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, along with a stream of stronger-than-expected profit reports from U.S. companies, helped to keep the losses in check. The S&P 500 remains within 1.4% of its record. Edgewell Personal Care, the company behind the Schick, Playtex and Banana Boat brands, fell 18.8% after reporting lower profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Rod Little said it was a very weak season for sun care in North America, while tariffs are acting as a drag on profits. All kinds of companies have been telling investors how much they expect tariffs to shave off their earnings this year, and trade policy was one of the most common topics U.S. services businesses talked about in the latest monthly survey compiled by the Institute for Supply Management about their activity. “Tariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies,” one company in the health care and social assistance business said, for example. “Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes.” Another business in the real estate, rental and leasing industry told the institute that economic “uncertainty remains the dominant theme. However, the tariff talk has turned out to be much more bluster than actual policy, and businesses have seemed to tune out the noise.” The threat of tariffs isn’t seeming to slow the juggernaut of investment flowing into artificial-intelligence technology. Palantir Technologies rose 7.8% after the AI-platform provider reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The AI darling also raised its forecast for revenue over the full year, and its stock climbed further after it had already doubled for the year so far coming into the day. “We continue to see the astonishing impact of AI leverage,” CEO Alex Karp said. Axon Enterprise leaped 16.4% after the company, which sells Tasers, body cameras and software to public safety departments, reported a much stronger profit than analysts expected. It also cited growth in its AI offerings, which can save time for transcriptions and other tasks, and raised its forecast for revenue this year. On the losing side of Wall Street was American Eagle Outfitters, which dropped 9.5% to give back some of its 23.6% jump from the day before. That’s when Trump weighed in on the debate surrounding the retailer’s advertisements, which highlight actor Sydney Sweeney’s great jeans. Some critics thought the ad’s reference to the blonde-haired and blue-eyed actor’s “great genes” may be extolling a narrow set of beauty standards, while Trump said that being “WOKE is for losers.” Yum Brands fell 5.1% after the company behind KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut reported results for the latest quarter that came up just short of analysts’ expectations. All told, the S&P 500 sank 30.75 points to 6,299.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 61.90 to 44,111.74, and the Nasdaq composite fell 137.03 to 20,916.55. The pressure is on companies to report bigger profits after the U.S. stock market surged to record after record from a low point in April. The big rally fueled criticism that the broad market had become too expensive. For stock prices to look like better bargains, companies could produce bigger profits, or interest rates could fall. The latter may happen in September, when the Federal Reserve has its next meeting. Expectations have built sharply for a rate cut at that meeting since a report on the U.S. job market on Friday came in much weaker than economists expected. Lower interest rates would make stocks look less expensive, while also giving the overall economy a boost. The potential downside is that they could push inflation higher. Treasury yields sank sharply after Friday’s release of the jobs report, and they haven’t recovered. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.19% from 4.22% late Monday and from 4.39% just before the release of the jobs report. That’s a significant move for the bond market. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. India’s Sensex was an outlier and dipped 0.4% on concerns about trade tensions with the United States as the Trump administration pushes for cutbacks in the country’s oil purchases from Russia. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

They attributed the outflows to investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and a cooling U.S. economy, and remain optimistic that these crypto-focused products will regain momentum, particularly with the likely regulatory approval of new altcoin-based products. “The spot crypto ETPs are benefiting from a one-two punch of macro demand for Bitcoin and regulatory changes that will likely accelerate blockchain adoption,” said Zach Pandl, head of research for crypto fund manager Grayscale. “Both trends should continue in the second half of 2025 and beyond.” He added that the likely approval of staking ETFs could serve as a catalyst to further net inflows. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the decline “a breather,” and said that he remained “bullish long, long term." “I stick to this phrase–two steps forward, one step back,” he said. Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows have topped $1.25 billion over the past three days, while their recently torrid Ethereum counterparts have hemorrhaged more than $600 million since last Friday. Ethereum last posted outflows on July 2. It was the first time since a three-day period extending from the end of March into early April that investors simultaneously pulled more assets from both groups of funds than they invested in them on consecutive days. BTC fell below $112,500 at one point, its lowest mark since July 10, although it recovered some ground on Tuesday. ETH sank to $3,380, its lowest level since the middle of the month. Pandl noted that “there was evidence of froth in global markets in late July, including a surge in meme stock trading, high volumes in penny stocks, and tight credit spreads.” “Signs of slower growth in the U.S. economy cooled investor enthusiasm and triggered the latest drawdown across assets,” he said. The two largest crypto assets have been declining since last week, following a cooler-than-expected jobs report, the firing of the head of the government agency that compiles this data, and a fresh escalation of the Trump administration’s global trade war. But Pandl said that the crypto exchange traded product outflows are consistent with pullbacks in financial markets as a whole and are "comparatively small,” noting that recent outflows of Bitcoin ETPs were around 1% of assets, whereas the highest volume US equity ETF saw around 2% of assets in outflows. Balchunas noted that the funds have received massive investments at an unprecedented pace, so the outflows were small relative to the size of the funds, particularly the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone now manages more than $70 billion in assets (AUM). IBIT recorded 295 million in net outflows over the course of the last two trading days, about 1.5% of the funds it has generated since April 7. “You should tolerate up to 10% and still be a happy camper,” Balchunas said. “These [out]flows are nickel and dime compared to the haul it just took in. You have to anticipate little periods of outflows here and there because there’s people trading it and doing all sorts of stuff. If there’s a little sell off in the equity market that’s going to hit it.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

August 05, 2025 16:19 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=159602&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

August 05, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7 billion, gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income was $872 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income was $897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter results were impacted by the U.S. Government's export control on our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%. “We delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter led by record server and PC processor sales,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are seeing robust demand across our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen processor share gains.” “We achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth and generated record free cash flow this quarter, reflecting our disciplined execution,” said Jean Hu, AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer. “Our strategic investments across hardware, software and systems position us well to support robust future growth and drive long-term shareholder value.” GAAP Quarterly Financial Results Non-GAAP(*) Quarterly Financial Results Segment Summary Recent PR Highlights Current OutlookAMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Cautionary Statement” below. For the third quarter of 2025, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 28% and sequential growth of approximately 13%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 54%. Our current outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipments to China as our license applications are currently under review by the U.S. Government.

Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD’s most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments. The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers. The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services. The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, restructuring charges, and income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows.

August 05, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7 billion, gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income was $872 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income was $897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter results were impacted by the U.S. Government's export control on our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%. “We delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter led by record server and PC processor sales,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are seeing robust demand across our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen processor share gains.” “We achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth and generated record free cash flow this quarter, reflecting our disciplined execution,” said Jean Hu, AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer. “Our strategic investments across hardware, software and systems position us well to support robust future growth and drive long-term shareholder value.” GAAP Quarterly Financial Results Non-GAAP(*) Quarterly Financial Results Segment Summary Recent PR Highlights Current OutlookAMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Cautionary Statement” below. For the third quarter of 2025, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 28% and sequential growth of approximately 13%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 54%. Our current outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipments to China as our license applications are currently under review by the U.S. Government.

The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows.

Title: Restructuring Wondery: Amazon Exec Steve Boom on the Company’s Mission to Consolidate Podcasts and Focus on Celebrity-Led Titles

By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor In a crowded market, stars shine brightest. This was Amazon’s guiding principle in the restructuring of its audio entertainment operations. The company’s decision to consolidate aspects of its Wondery podcasting division with its larger Audible audio book division surprised the podcasting sector when the news broke on Aug. 4. Audible has been part of Amazon since 2008. Wondery, launched in 2016 by entrepreneur Hernan Lopez, was acquired in late 2020. In the five years since, podcasting has exploded as a medium, seeing in particular a big boom in video-enhanced programming. That growth spurt spurred Amazon to make structural shifts at Wondery and Audible. Related Stories 'A Quiet Place 3' Sets July 2027 Release Date, John Krasinski Returns as Director Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Sheridan and John Krasinski Among Hitmakers Paramount Skydance Needs to Keep Happy “This was definitely a strategic decision,” Steve Boom, Amazon’s VP of audio, Twitch and games, tells Variety. “As we’ve seen how the market has evolved and how we need to best organize to address the market opportunity where we’re seeing the most success, it became pretty apparent to us over the last several months. This acceleration of video podcasting is really what prompted this restructuring.” Popular on Variety Boom says the moves were spurred by the clear bifurcation that Amazon audio leaders began to see in Wondery’s output. Many of the platform’s most popular titles fell into one of two broad categories: narrative-driven and personality-centric. Narrative titles tend to be deeply reported productions focused on true crime, history, pop culture, investigative reports and, increasingly, kid-centric shows. Personality-focused shows include such high-profile titles as Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert,” Travis and Jason Kelce’s “New Heights” and LeBron James’ upcoming “Mind the Game” series. Tom Webster, a partner in the podcast trade organization Sounds Profitable, says Amazon’s reorg is right in line with the larger trends in podcasting. “So much of the current narrative in podcasting is really being driven by video, even though most consumers spent most of their time with audio only,” Webster says. “But for the biggest shows, they want to see LeBron. They want to see the Kelce brothers.” Over time, Amazon brass realized that the two kinds of podcast required different approaches to development, marketing and audience retention support. With the restructuring, Wondery’s narrative titles will be added to the vast archive of programs available under Audible’s subscription platform. Wondery’s focus will turn to the care and feeding of its celebrity- and personality-fronted shows. “We’ve learned over time that the business models for these two different types of content are actually quite different,” Boom tells Variety. “On the one hand, the video-creator podcasts are monetizing incredibly well through advertising. It’s a very, very strong advertising business. In contrast, with the narrative podcasts, we’ve come to the conclusion that those are best monetized through a premium business model. And it turns out that we have in Amazon the leading company in the world in premium spoken word modernization. So we decided that if the best business model [for narrative shows] is premium, then it makes sense to bring these two things into one place where we can actually monetize them appropriately.” Wondery ranks high among the most popular podcast platforms in the country. But as the overall podcast marketplace became increasingly crowded in the post-pandemic years, Wondery looked to differentiate itself with both volume of production and starry names. More recently, ESPN and other networks are turning to video podcasts as low-cost content options that ideally become a daily or weekly habit with viewers. “Video has grown much more quickly than audio-only over the last two or three years. And within the video segment, you have some that are really premium in terms of production values and the quality of the talent and the guests on the shows,” Boom says. “So there’s more and more content out there to consume. Even though the overall audience for podcasting is growing, with that much growth in [the volume of] content, you have a very uneven environment where some shows are growing their audiences, others are flat and others are down.” Amazon’s audio tune-up will result in about 100 layoffs within Wondery. Many staffers will move to new positions within Amazon. Jen Sargent, who has been CEO of Wondery for the past four years, will exit the company after a transition period. Boom stresses that Sargent has been “a phenomenal leader,” for Wondery. “Sometimes the market changes, and you have to respond to those changes,” he added.

Title: How To Tap The AI Nuclear Bonanza For 10%+ Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. The AI boom still has plenty of room to run—but investing purely in AI stocks is not the best way to tap into it. NVIDIA (NVDA) and friends yield next to nothing! And these are crowded trades. Luckily for us, there’s another way to get in. Bargains are still available in the corner of the market we’ll get into below—as are 10%+ dividends. It’s all tied into AI’s voracious appetite for electricity. Yes, utilities are part of this play, but we want to go a little bit deeper and zero in on stocks specifically tied into nuclear power. We’re going to tap into those through high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that both trade at discounts and send huge payouts our way, too. Let me explain. It’s been about a month since the Wall Street Journal reported on President Trump’s plans to expand nuclear power in the US. The story went mostly unnoticed, but it’s an important one because it’s a multi-year plan that has bipartisan—and indeed non-political—support. For a couple of years now, tech companies have been pushing for more nuclear power. Alphabet (GOOGL) has been investing billions into nuclear-power companies such as Kairos Power and Elementl Power, while Amazon poured $500 million into X-Energy to build up nuclear capacity. AI, and its near-bottomless power demand, are behind these moves. And since AI is now transforming the American workplace and boosting productivity, the debate over whether this tech is a flash in the pan or here to stay is settled: It’s here to stay. Back in September 2020 (i.e., long before ChatGPT was released), I wrote in my CEF Insider advisory that one needs to invest widely to benefit from the technology, since it can produce efficiencies in circuitous ways: “Some companies, like insurance firms, will profit from artificial intelligence as this technology improves underwriting, lowers risk and improves health outcomes for patients.” The growing attention that nuclear power is getting is a prime example of this circuitous, second- and third-order benefit from AI playing out. Since AI is power-hungry, electricity and infrastructure suppliers serving the growing nuclear-power business will benefit. You might be thinking, “Okay, but how do I actually ride this wave?” Well, as I mentioned off the top, we need to look further afield than the NVIDIAs of the world to capture these higher-order effects of AI. That’s where utilities come in: Higher energy demand is a clear win for utilities, yet in the three years since ChatGPT and its range of copycats have been released, the utilities sector, shown in orange above by the performance of the benchmark Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU), has returned just 25%, less than half the broader market. That tells us the sector as a whole is still undervalued. And it also means buying XLU is still on the table as a way to capture the growing power (and specifically nuclear-power) demand AI is creating. But XLU isn’t the only play, and it’s hardly the best. As an index fund, it gets us broad exposure to the utilities sector, but broad isn’t what we want with something like AI, which is being brought in unevenly throughout the country. We want something a bit more tactical to target where the demand is hottest. A more active approach, like that of a CEF called the Gabelli Utility Trust (GUT), fits the bill here. The fund holds firms like WEC Energy (WEC), which is looking at expanding nuclear power production in Wisconsin, and Constellation Energy (CEG), owner of the largest collection of nuclear plants in the US. Plus, with its 10.7% yield, GUT is a much better income provider than 2.8%-yielding XLU. Plus, over the long haul, GUT (in orange above) has closely tracked XLU’s total returns, so we’re not sacrificing performance for income here. However, there are two snags with this fund. First, if GUT is just tracking the index, it isn’t outperforming and thus we can’t expect it to be tactical enough to benefit from the AI boom more than an index fund would. Plus, the fund is far from a bargain. GUT currently trades at a 96.2% premium to NAV. That’s the second-highest premium in the CEF world, and it means investors are paying nearly $2 for every $1 of assets! And, as we saw last year, that premium can disappear fast, causing big losses in the short term, as well. So, while GUT has done a good job transforming utilities’ profits into income, its premium and its historical performance suggest it isn’t the way to go for us. So instead, let’s look at another CEF, the 10.1%-yielding Voya Infrastructure Industrials and Materials Fund (IDE), which trades at a 4% discount to NAV. As the name says, the fund holds key infrastructure suppliers like Siemens AG, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Schneider Electric SE, all of which stand to gain from an AI-driven infrastructure buildout, including on the nuclear front. Not only is IDE a lot cheaper than GUT, it’s also outperformed it on a total-NAV-return basis (based on its underlying portfolio, not its sentiment-driven market price) over the last three years. With a slightly higher total NAV return, IDE’s management has proven they know where to put money to get returns, and the fund’s lower volatility is attractive, too. Without big swings in its asset value, like GUT saw in 2023, IDE hasn’t had to sell assets at a loss to maintain its payouts. Additionally, the fact that IDE has beaten GUT over the last three years on a total-NAV-return basis, suggests it is being more tactical and benefiting more from the AI boom. That makes it more than worth your attention as a place to invest as nuclear demand rises in the long term. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

U.S. equities fell at midday following a weak report on the services industry and concerns about new tariffs. The S&P 500, and Nasdaq dropped about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%. Gartner (IT) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when the research and advisory firm slashed its guidance on declining revenue at its largest research unit. Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) slumped after the drugmaker announced a Phase 2 trial of its experimental pain medicine missed a key goal, and that it would no longer continue its development. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and other chipmakers slid when President Donald Trump said in an interview he would be announcing new semiconductor tariffs soon. Axon Enterprise (AXON) shares took off when the Taser maker exceeded earnings and revenue estimates and boosted its outlook on strong demand for its security products. DuPont (DD) also raised its guidance as it lowered its estimate for how much tariffs would impact full-year earnings. In addition, the chemical and materials maker reported better-than-expected results, and shares gained. Software analytics firm Palantir Technologies (PLTR) beat profit and sales estimates and lifted its outlook as it benefited from artificial intelligence product demand and more government contracts. Oil futures slid. Gold prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the yen, but lost ground to the euro and pound. Major cryptocurrencies traded down. TradingView

Title: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against iRobot Corporation and Certain Officers – IRBT

Time Published: 2025-08-05T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
August 05, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Title: Against The Grain: Analyst Targets $300K Bitcoin Price—When Will It Happen?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A well-known Bitcoin analyst is charting a path that most traders don’t expect. According to reports, the pseudonymous quant strategist PlanB told his 216,000 YouTube subscribers he believes Bitcoin will climb to at least $300,000 by the end of 2026. That’s a bold call, given that 60% of market participants think the world’s largest cryptocurrency won’t hit that mark in just one and a half years. Based on his stock-to-flow model, PlanB says Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity drives long-term value. He argues the model points toward an average of $500,000 per coin after the next halving. The stock-to-flow setup gives a wide range—from $250,000 at the low end to $1 million at the high end—but PlanB believes the center of that range is where Bitcoin is headed. His view flips the script on most forecasts today. The analyst is also keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s realized price. This metric looks at the price at which recent cohorts of coins last moved on-chain, then divides by the total supply. Since the current market price of $114,150—up 1% on the day—sits above every major cohort band, PlanB sees a classic bull-market pattern with no bear-market warning signs in sight. Based on data from price-forecast services, Bitcoin may average $112,000 this month of August, peaking near $114,800 and dipping to around $109,000. For September 2025, forecasts narrow to a band between $111,000 and $112,400, with an average close to $111,7002. Into 2026, some models see steady gains toward $194,000 by December, with highs above $225,000. According to market watchers, Anthony Scaramucci expects Bitcoin to top $170,000 within the next year. US President Donald Trump has not weighed in on crypto recently. Cathie Wood has her sights on $1 million per coin over the next five years. Digital Coin Price forecasts a swing to about $119,860 by mid-August 2025, then longer-term gains into the $210,000–$230,000 range during 2025. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor, Strategy Chairman, says Bitcoin’s limited supply and growing institutional interest could push it to $10 million, sparking fresh debate over its long-term role as a global asset. Based on analysis, investors should remember that models are tools, not guarantees. PlanB’s $300,000 call sits at the optimistic end of the spectrum. Others see more modest moves, while some have even larger long-term hopes. Whether Bitcoin follows its past cycles or breaks new ground, it’s clear the debate over its next big run is only getting started.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

August 05, 2025 08:41 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024, and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085.

(NASDAQ: TMCI) If you have held Treace Medical Concepts (NASDAQ: TMCI) shares continuously since prior to May 8, 2023, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the Company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost you. Visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, or contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com or call 267-507-6085 to learn more. Why? A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts When business partnerships go beyond handshake deals to create fundamental interdependence, their stock prices often move in lockstep—sometimes with surprising precision. In the world of public markets, few relationships are as telling as those between strategic business partners whose fates have become intertwined. While investors often focus on diversification to reduce risk, some stocks move together with such consistency that they effectively become leveraged bets on each other’s success. The relationship between e-commerce giant Shopify (SHOP) and marketing automation company Klaviyo (KVYO) offers a compelling case study in how deep business partnerships translate directly into correlated stock movements. Since Klaviyo’s initial public offering in September 2023, the two stocks have exhibited a correlation coefficient estimated between 0.6 and 0.7—a relationship strong enough that savvy investors treat them as almost a single position when building portfolios. The Shopify-Klaviyo relationship goes far beyond a typical vendor partnership. The numbers tell the story of true business interdependence: This level of integration creates what economists call “economic coupling”—where the success of one company becomes fundamentally tied to the performance of another. When Shopify’s merchant base grows, Klaviyo benefits directly. When Klaviyo develops better marketing tools, Shopify’s platform becomes more valuable to merchants. The correlation between these stocks becomes most apparent when examining their price movements since Klaviyo’s public debut: Klaviyo launched its IPO at $30 per share on September 20, 2023, closing its first trading day at $32.76—a respectable 9.2% gain. During this period, Shopify was trading in the $60-70 range, providing a stable backdrop for its partner’s market debut. Perhaps the clearest evidence of correlation came during the market downturn in mid-2024. Both stocks hit their respective 52-week lows within days of each other: This synchronized selling wasn’t coincidental. As broader economic concerns about small business spending and e-commerce growth emerged, investors fled both stocks simultaneously, recognizing that headwinds for one would inevitably impact the other. The correlation proved equally strong on the upside. Both stocks staged impressive recoveries into early 2025: This parallel recovery was driven by renewed optimism about e-commerce growth, AI integration, and the overall health of their shared ecosystem. While the correlation is strong, it’s notably asymmetric. Klaviyo, with its beta coefficient of 1.24, acts as a leveraged play on Shopify’s performance. This makes intuitive sense given the relationship dynamics: Why Klaviyo is More Sensitive: Shopify’s Buffer Factors: Despite the strong overall correlation, there are periods when the stocks diverge, typically during: For investors, understanding partner stock correlations offers both opportunities and warnings: Smart investors approach correlated partner stocks with specific strategies: The Shopify-Klaviyo case illustrates several important principles about partner stock correlations: Surface-level partnerships rarely create sustained stock correlations. But when companies become operationally interdependent—through revenue sharing, technology integration, or strategic ownership—their stock prices tend to move together consistently. The larger partner (Shopify) typically shows more stability, while the smaller partner (Klaviyo) exhibits amplified movements. This creates natural lead-lag relationships that sophisticated traders can exploit. Correlations often strengthen over time as the market better understands the business relationship. Early recognition of these dynamics can provide edge for perceptive investors. Several factors will determine whether the Shopify-Klaviyo correlation remains strong: The Shopify-Klaviyo relationship demonstrates that in today’s interconnected business landscape, strategic partnerships can create correlations as strong as those found within industry sectors. For investors, recognizing these relationships early—and understanding their asymmetric nature—can provide both opportunity and necessary caution. As businesses become increasingly specialized and interdependent, expect to see more examples of partner stock correlations. The key is identifying when partnerships have moved beyond contractual relationships to true economic coupling, where the success of one partner becomes fundamentally tied to the other’s performance. In the case of Shopify and Klaviyo, their correlation serves as a masterclass in how modern business partnerships translate directly into capital market dynamics—offering investors a clear example of how strategic alliances can drive stock price movements with remarkable consistency. The correlation between strategic partners’ stock prices reflects the underlying reality of modern business: in an interconnected economy, isolated success is increasingly rare, and the most important question isn’t whether companies will rise or fall together, but rather how amplified those movements will be.

U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after indexes rebounded yesterday following last week's selloff; Palantir (PLTR) shares are surging in premarket trading after the firm raised its sales outlook amid strong demand for its AI platform; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reports second-quarter results after the closing bell today; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reportedly has fired some employees after discovering a leak of sensitive trade secrets; and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares are plunging after it ended development of a pain treatment after test results did not meet its goals. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after indexes surged Monday to rebound from last week's selloff. Nasdaq futures are 0.4% higher after the tech-heavy index gained 2% in the prior session, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% after the benchmark index rose 1.5% yesterday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are little changed. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is near flat at nearly $115,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is higher. Oil and gold futures are both declining. Palantir (PLTR) shares are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm posted better-than-expected second-quarter results and raised its outlook on strong demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform. The AI software company reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents on revenue that jumped 48% year-over-year to a record $1 billion, above estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Palantir's commercial business nearly doubled from a year ago, while its U.S. business grew 68%. Palantir sees third-quarter sales of $1.08 billion to $1.09 billion, and full-year revenue of $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion, both ranges above analysts' estimates. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is set to report second-quarter results after the closing bell today after a strong run for the chipmaker's stock amid hopes export curb headwinds could soon ease. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect AMD to report adjusted EPS of $0.48 on revenue that jumped 27% revenue to $7.43 billion on strong data center sales. AMD warned in May that it would likely take a hit from tighter restrictions on chip exports to China, though the company said last month that it plans to restart exports of its MI308 chips once it receives final approval from U.S. authorities. AMD shares are higher by nearly 2% in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) has reportedly discovered a leak of trade secrets related to its advanced chipmaking process and has taken disciplinary actions against the employees involved. Multiple outlets reported that TSMC said its comprehensive monitoring process allowed it to discover the issue and carry out a swift internal investigation. Nikkei Asia reported that the company fired several employees for attempting to obtain proprietary information on 2-nanometer chip development. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a key supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). TSMC shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares are falling 14% in premarket trading after the drugmaker said it would end development of its VX-993 pain treatment after tests failed to meet goals. The news trumped better-than-expected second-quarter results, as Vertex's adjusted earnings per share of $4.52 and revenue that increased 12% to $2.96 billion topped Visible Alpha projections. Last quarter, Vertex said that research and development costs were weighing on results.

Palantir's commercial business nearly doubled from a year ago, while its U.S. business grew 68%. Palantir sees third-quarter sales of $1.08 billion to $1.09 billion, and full-year revenue of $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion, both ranges above analysts' estimates. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is set to report second-quarter results after the closing bell today after a strong run for the chipmaker's stock amid hopes export curb headwinds could soon ease. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect AMD to report adjusted EPS of $0.48 on revenue that jumped 27% revenue to $7.43 billion on strong data center sales. AMD warned in May that it would likely take a hit from tighter restrictions on chip exports to China, though the company said last month that it plans to restart exports of its MI308 chips once it receives final approval from U.S. authorities. AMD shares are higher by nearly 2% in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) has reportedly discovered a leak of trade secrets related to its advanced chipmaking process and has taken disciplinary actions against the employees involved. Multiple outlets reported that TSMC said its comprehensive monitoring process allowed it to discover the issue and carry out a swift internal investigation. Nikkei Asia reported that the company fired several employees for attempting to obtain proprietary information on 2-nanometer chip development. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a key supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). TSMC shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares are falling 14% in premarket trading after the drugmaker said it would end development of its VX-993 pain treatment after tests failed to meet goals. The news trumped better-than-expected second-quarter results, as Vertex's adjusted earnings per share of $4.52 and revenue that increased 12% to $2.96 billion topped Visible Alpha projections. Last quarter, Vertex said that research and development costs were weighing on results.

Title: King Princess’s Homecoming

Time Published: 2025-08-05T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
After the Civil War, the German-born Jewish businessman Isidor Straus moved with his family to New York City. Straus was enterprising and handsome, with small round spectacles, an angular nose, and a coarse, peppery beard. He started off as a crockery vender; by the turn of the twentieth century, he had made millions as a co-owner of Macy’s, befriended Grover Cleveland, served a year in Congress, and fallen in love. His wife was Rosalie Ida Blun, with whom he shared a birthday and seven children. On April 10, 1912, Isidor and Ida boarded the Titanic. She would decline a lifeboat, refusing to be separated from her husband. In James Cameron’s 1997 film, they embrace each other in bed, weeping, as the ship sinks. “I like to imagine they were thinking, ‘This is going to be a movie, we need to get our screen time,’ ” their great-great-granddaughter, Mikaela Straus, told me, taking a hit of a blunt on her couch, in Brooklyn. The last of her line of inheritance had been spent long before she was born. She’s bemused by suppositions about the advantages of her family legacy, which in reality boasts a centuries-deep ledger of addiction, estrangement, and untimely death. Only twenty-six, Mikaela, under the moniker King Princess, has begun to establish a musical legacy all her own. Over the past decade, she’s cultivated a reputation for a new kind of defiant, autodidactic pop stardom. Next month, she will release her striking third album, “Girl Violence”—her best yet—which cements her status not only as a virtuosic provocateur but as a generational talent. When Straus was seventeen, she wrote and produced her first single, a lesbian pop song that would eventually go platinum. It was her first semester at U.S.C.’s Thornton School of Music, and she was showering in her dorm suite when she started to hum a new melody. She ran, naked and dripping wet, out of the bathroom, and frantically asked a roommate for their phone. Into it, she recorded the first few phrases of what would become “1950,” a snappy serenade to a crush that has since accrued over half a billion streams. Straus had grown up in a recording studio, where she’d developed a shrewd understanding of pop arithmetic. Blending the honeyed soul of old-school crooners with the synthesized beats that dominated the airwaves and dance floors of her adolescence, she introduced audiences to what would become the King Princess sound: sexy, plaintive vocals, thrumming bass lines, and a fusion of digital and analog instrumentation. Shortly after the release of “1950,” in February, 2018, Harry Styles posted the lyrics on Twitter, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes overnight. Straus would go on to perform the song on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” then on “Saturday Night Live.” What made “1950” ’s success unique was its refusal to conform to the expectations of a Billboard-charting ballad; in a swirl of doo-wop snaps and reverb, it told a defiant, elliptical ode to gay history. “I hate it when dudes try to chase me,” Straus sings, in a raspy alto: But I love it when you try to save me’Cause I’m just a ladyI love it when we play 1950So cold that your stare’s bout to kill meI’m surprised when you kiss me The chorus toys with the erotics of bygone danger—conflating the perils of mid-century homophobia with a modern lover’s desire to play hard to get. “I was just thinking about how sad it is that we, you know, are horny for our own oppression,” she quipped on a podcast. Straus, who knew she was queer before she could write her name, was a lonely child. Though her parents were largely supportive of her sexuality, others were not: when she walked down the streets of New York holding hands with girlfriends as a young teen-ager, passersby would hurl expletives, slurs, and occasional threats. For company, she turned to literature—Radclyffe Hall’s “The Well of Loneliness,” Rita Mae Brown’s “Rubyfruit Jungle,” Nella Larsen’s “Passing,” Fannie Flagg’s “Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.” She particularly loved “The Price of Salt,” the only happy ending she encountered, and subsequently read every biography she could find of Patricia Highsmith and her lovers. She wrote the song as a way to reach across time toward them, to find a companion in history. That spring, the producer Mark Ronson heard Straus’s demos in an A. & R. meeting at Sony. They got dinner—a meeting she’s described wryly as a first date—and, struck by her raunch and then by her technical acumen, he signed her. (One of his favorite songs of hers is called “Pussy Is God.”) After Straus received an advance from Ronson’s imprint at Columbia Records, Zelig, one of the first things she did was pay off some forty thousand dollars in outstanding student loans. Her début EP, “Make My Bed,” opens with a prayer of thanks: “Eighteen years I spent / waiting for this.” In June, Straus told me how her time at the label ran its course. “We have enough documentaries about Britney Spears to know how it works,” she said, shrugging and packing her lip with Zyn, the nicotine pouches she’s substituted for a vaping addiction. She recalled how she and her mother—whom she jokes is the “D-list Kris Jenner”—had hired a lawyer to exegete every line of the contract for her, “and I still got fucked.” After seven years at Columbia, she left. “In L.A., I had become addicted to my own unhappiness. It reached a point where I was like, ‘I will die if certain things don’t change,’” she told me. “Mark was like a parent to me. He was gracious enough to let me go.” She made her new album, “Girl Violence,” free of oversight or contractual obligation, then scouted for distributors, landing with section1, the tiny partner label of the independent, Brooklyn-based Partisan Records. Their enthusiasm and compassion had surprised her. “I wasn’t used to people not caring about streams or views,” she told me. “Good art is not born out of fear.” Straus, whose elfin face is framed by a piecey shag, with arched pink lips, a delicate nose, and hazel eyes underscored by creases that make her look a little strung out, was setting up for her semi-regular queer costume party, BAZONGAS, at a warehouse in East Williamsburg. The theme was “Slut Funeral”—a celebration of her new album’s lead single, “RIP KP,” and her own symbolic rebirth—and a handful of employees from Partisan were moving a two-hundred-pound steel casket to the lip of a stage, which had been decorated with more than forty fake candles. Helping with the manual labor in a ribbed white tank top, shredded jeans, and Timberland work boots, she joked to me that she had no security concerns about throwing a party open to the public: “What are these, like, weird, funny lesbians going to do to me?” Her anxieties about the exposure had more to do with her own behavior. “I had decided in my head that I wanted to be of the people, and around people, and available to people, so what if I fucked up?” she told me. “What if I have too many drinks, or get embarrassed or defensive?” Straus modulates between a kind of studied languor and a firebrand’s stridency. “They’ve tried to media-train me at least eighteen times,” she said, within minutes of our first meeting. She repeatedly glanced at her publicity team as we spoke, even when they were out of earshot. The meta-acknowledgment of her ungovernability can seem strategic—as if it might make a journalist, or a collaborator, put less stock in her brash pronouncements. Chris Robbins and Brontë Jane, the married founders of section1, first met Straus over Zoom. It was Valentine’s Day, and Straus introduced herself to her prospective bosses by describing the lingerie her girlfriend had brought over. Robbins recalls thinking, “Only one of you exists in the world.” Straus was mouthy, sharp, and knowledgeable, recalling the punky theatrics of Courtney Love and Gwen Stefani, but the pair were most compelled by the paradox of a certain calculated authenticity—she wielded vulgarity with the choreographed poise of a clown. “It’s this idea of Mikaela as a total fucking rock star, but in the most self-aware, almost self-parodying way,” Jane explained. Straus’s approach to her new album reminded Jane of one of her favorite films, Ingmar Bergman’s “Persona,” in which a young nurse struggles to distinguish herself from her patient. The whole conceit of “King Princess” is arranged around a fun-house effect—seeing iterations of yourself that aren’t exactly you but which you nonetheless identify with. Straus took inspiration from the Surrealist French artist Claude Cahun (also androgynous and pseudonymous), whose uncanny self-portraits troubled the possibility of documenting a “real” self. “I still don’t know if I’m supposed to call her King Princess or Mikaela,” Hugh Jackman told me. He acted opposite Straus in the forthcoming film “Song Sung Blue”—her feature début—and, in April, invited her to join him onstage at his Radio City residency. They duetted Sonny & Cher’s “I Got You Babe,” and he recalled being taken by the immediacy of her performance. “She had rehearsed with the orchestra, but I felt like she was discovering the song for the first time as she sang it. That kind of confidence can’t be taught.” When Straus was a teen-ager, musician friends would designate certain sessions in the studio with her as “king princess days,” summoning a punk-diva spirit to the console: Mick Jagger in a bustier. (“I’m literally fifty-fifty,” Straus told me, of her gender. “There’s a huge disconnect between my body and my soul. I think that disconnect is powerful if it’s harnessed, but sometimes you wake up and you’re, like, ‘If I put clothes on this carcass, I’m going to kill myself.’ ”) Her relationship to womanhood, which has been fraught and erratic since a tomboyish childhood on the baseball team, relies on notions of drag and extravagance; if the standard is a caricature, she can’t fail in its execution. For her birthday, in December, she threw a Harry Potter-themed BAZONGAS and dressed in full prosthetics as a busty, camel-toed Voldemort. But the primary reason for dividing her identity is psychological. “It’s like E.M.D.R.,” she explained, referencing a form of therapy in which a patient alternates between positive and negative memories. “The whole thing is to create a safe place in your mind you can go to when things get overwhelming. King Princess is that for me.” Mikaela Mullaney Straus was born to Oliver Straus, a recording engineer, and Agnes Mullaney, who worked in fashion; they would separate by the time she turned three. The young Mikaela, responding to the fights whirling around her, began to lash out in turn. She also channelled her emotions into art. When she was six, her mother picked her up from a babysitter who informed her that Mikaela had written a song on GarageBand called “It’s O.K. to Be Wrong.” “Before I used music to impress anyone, I used music to cope with my very big feelings,” she told me. “I needed an outlet.” Mission Sound, an esteemed Brooklyn recording studio founded by Straus’s father, began in the cellar of the Williamsburg house where she grew up. At first, it was difficult to coax clients across the river—Oliver has described the neighborhood in the early nineties as “Siberia to Manhattan musicians.” Soon, though, he amassed an impressive portfolio of local artists, which now includes such hitmakers as Jack Antonoff, the National, and Shawn Mendes. After buying the two-story fixer-upper for seventy-five thousand dollars, Oliver invested in a Neve 8026 console that had been used by the likes of the Who and the Kinks. To accommodate the upgraded gear, he expanded his business into an old factory, where he still runs it, half a mile away. When Oliver and Agnes separated, she kept the house, and he moved into a small room next to the new studio. He installed a kitchenette and, in order to share custody of his daughter, built her a loft bed over his floor mattress. From the time that she could walk, Mikaela would sneak across the hall to play with whatever she could—microphones, guitars, keyboards, faders, all manner of expensive equipment that she regarded, to her father’s moderate distress, as toys. Musicians and audio engineers came and went, and Mikaela would sit on the couch behind them, imitating their riffs and vocal exercises. Sometimes a patron, taken by her precocity, would give her a lesson. She can play almost anything. (“I’m sort of a Swiss Army knife, except no woodwinds,” she told me.) When she was five, she finally earned her father’s praise by composing her first song, a clever jingle about her dog Jackie, and he recorded it on the Neve. But after he started a new family with a second wife, their relationship frayed. By the time she finished middle school, she’d taught herself to use the audio software Ableton Live so she could make music without him. “I think people think my dad was the type of person who could call up the head of a label and be, like, ‘My daughter!’ ” she told me. Instead, the chief privilege of her father’s profession was proximity. Through the studio, she’d met a songwriter who’d introduced her to a manager who’d introduced her to a producer, Mike Malchicoff, who helped her record “1950.” “If I was shit, nothing would’ve happened,” she said. (The bravado she traffics in can feel defensive, but not baseless.) Meanwhile, her mother’s house offered its own revolving door of mentors. Agnes, who has been sober for thirty-nine years, was a twelve-step sponsor, and the home was always bustling with guests from the program. Growing up, Straus said, “I was obsessed with very flawed people. You have to look at somebody’s character and be, like, ‘This is a good person, even though there’s fucked-up shit here.’ ” Agnes, aware that addiction ran in the family—she had met Oliver when both were in recovery—was terrified that similar dangers might befall her daughter. “For all the incredible patience she had with her sponsees, I got none of that,” Mikaela recalled. “But it was out of fear. And she was right.” In high school, she was disorganized and distracted. She attended Avenues, a private school in Manhattan, on financial aid and an arts merit scholarship. She smoked cigarettes in the bathroom, cheated on assignments, and rushed home to practice piano. That she was gay and believed she would one day be famous made her a tough hang for most. (“I don’t think I’m really that likable,” she once said, offhand.) But her difficulties in her weakest courses forced her to hone a different asset. She knew she needed to do something to distract her peers and instructors from a paucity of right answers—so she learned to make them laugh. Across thirteen slinky, dancey, scuzzy tracks, “Girl Violence” chronicles the frivolous, sexy havoc Straus has seen women wreak on one another’s lives. Almost all the associated visuals and concepts were her ideas. The cover art, an out-of-focus closeup of Straus’s face, pays homage to Blur’s self-titled album. The music video for “RIP KP” finds Straus, after a car wreck, in gay Hell: a place where strippers in leopard print strain Martinis through their toes and the bathroom attendant accepts tips below the skirt, placing them in the open maw of a muppet merkin. The record, which was completed late last year, got its start in the winter of 2022, after her sophomore venture, “Hold On Baby,” saw critical acclaim but only modest commercial returns. She had been working on a collection of new songs, including “Cry Cry Cry,” a bratty diss track with an infectious bridge. The label wasn’t sold. Straus was increasingly miserable in Los Angeles, navigating the breakdown of a four-year relationship and struggling to curtail her substance use. On a visit to New York, she met with two very different Brooklyn producers: Jacob Portrait, a warm but aloof multi-instrumentalist from the psych-rock band Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and Joe Pincus, an affable software geek who had programmed beats for Doechii and SZA. (“I think if you look at the three of us on paper, you’d be, like, how the fuck would this ever work?” Pincus said.) That summer, she left her label, her lease, and her relationship. It was time to go home. She returned to her mother’s house (and, as she made a point of mentioning when we met, now sleeps in the bed where she was conceived). In September of 2023, she booked a month at her dad’s studio with Portrait and Pincus. Oliver would make them dinner and pop his head in excitedly if he heard Mikaela shredding a guitar solo, but he mostly left them alone. “Having another cook in the kitchen, especially her dad, was not something Mikaela was interested in,” Portrait said. “He’s been in this business a long time. They both have really big opinions.” Eventually, Straus showed her father the finished record. He said that it sounded like Mission Sound. “That’s the highest compliment coming from him—that it sounds like his room,” she told me. Some of the new album is about her ex, including the swaggery, synth-heavy lament “Alone Again.” On the outro, Straus sings, “I got bigger dreams than being your baby / Honestly, I’m so relieved it’s over.” But “Girl Violence” is not a straightforward breakup album. Instead, it uses her heartbreak as a metaphor for other kinds of fissures and reinventions. On “Origin Story,” a hip-hop-percussive hero’s journey, she sings, I’ve had to face fire, fight fearand spend a lot of time in the mirrorI’m cool, I’m weirderYeah, I’m hot, I’m deeperI’m starting to feel myself again Until now, Straus’s work has flipped between styles like a jukebox. Unlike many popular artists, she was never classically trained or in any other bands, nor was she plucked from obscurity to perform assembly-line creations. More than anything, thanks to her childhood at Mission Sound, she was a mockingbird. Her discography feels like the output of, appropriately, a Zelig, rather than the committed expressions of a singular mind. Across two full-length albums, one EP, and a handful of singles, Straus has offered variations of R. & B., grunge, disco, electro-clash, funk, alternative, and soul. She has collaborated with Fiona Apple and the late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, performed onstage with Julian Casablancas and Florence Welch, and covered Neil Young, Cyndi Lauper, Hole, Soundgarden, and the Velvet Underground (twice). She was raised on Led Zeppelin, Prince, David Bowie, and Jack White; she worships the Beatles’ live sessions. Identifying the latent similarities among her influences and doing away with anything ornamental or aspirational, “Girl Violence” finds its footing in late-nineties electronic rock. (“I feel like my live show has always been a rock show, even when I’m playing pop music,” she said. “Which is just to say that genre is meaningless.”) It’s her happiest album, sonically and lyrically, with only one ballad: the closer, “Serena,” which is a lullaby to a friend. “Cry Cry Cry,” released last month as the second single, is the standout. Its opening line—“Well, fuck me, I thought we were friends”—recalls the whiny yowls of Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus. It also highlights the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts effect of the producing trio’s differences: Pincus, who has been nominated for a Grammy, brought his pop expertise, shoring up the twinkly harmonies and tight ’NSync drums, while Portrait drew on his background in the D.I.Y. scene, complimenting Straus’s pastiche bravura with a rough-edged Wheatus sleaze. Pincus’s textures are contemporary, but the references and use of real instruments by the other two make the finished product feel timeless. Straus, Pincus, and Portrait engineered “Girl Violence” themselves, forgoing the type of celebrity mixers she’d hired in the past. This time, wanting to figure out what “King Princess” actually sounded like, Straus went her own way. On a punishingly hot Wednesday night in June, Straus hosted a surprise preview show for “Girl Violence” at Market Hotel, an intimate, grimy standing-room venue that rattles when the subway passes. Save for the première of “RIP KP” on “Colbert” the night prior, it was her first time performing before an audience in years, and she was nervous, hiding out beforehand in the green room with her girlfriend. She would play the album all the way through with a mostly new band, in addition to her longtime drummer, Antoine Fadavi, and her bassist, Logan McQuade, who’d been beside her at the first-ever King Princess show, a Halloween party in 2017. (She was Ripley from “Alien”; he was a vague approximation of Jack Black in “School of Rock.”) “I can’t imagine being on stage without him,” she confessed, in a rare fit of sincerity. Straus shook off her dread as security guards escorted her through the crowd, teen-age girls squealing and clawing at her as she passed. “I missed you, New York,” she yelled under a rosy spotlight, wearing another skintight white tank top, this one bearing the name of her record across the chest. Hundreds of fans roared back. A louche, old-school performer, she channels Robert Plant and Iggy Pop, and elicits similar erotic zeal from her audience. As she sang, even with a guitar strapped to her shoulder, she ran her fingers up and down the mike stand, along her bare stomach, and through her curls, dripping with sweat. The new record is full of horny couplets, which she discharged without flinching. When she paused to slug a cherry-red cocktail, a fan screamed, “I love you!” The gig, which had sold out in nine minutes, was all-ages. Hours before showtime, dozens of young people, mostly queer women, had begun lining the noisy Bushwick block outside. Two sixteen-year-olds in baby-doll dresses and smears of thick eyeliner had come up from Long Island. “It’s hard to find people like this where I’m from,” one of them told me shyly. Nearby, a woman in her mid-fifties, who had taken the train in from Philadelphia for the set, waited for her wife to bring back drinks from the bar. She emphasized how much it meant to her to be in a majority-gay space. She’d grown up in the Pennsylvania suburbs and had come out, catastrophically, at thirteen; this year alone, more than a dozen anti-L.G.B.T.Q. bills have been proposed in her state. What she loved most about Straus, she said, was that “she’s unapologetically queer.” Toward the end of the set, Straus introduced a bluesy rendition of “1950” by entreating the crowd to sing along. “If you think about it, this is really where the girl violence started,” she said, taking a seat at the piano. “Crying over some pussy, as it goes.” Straus appreciates the environment at her shows, where, she told me later, “I’ve seen people get fingered, but I’ve never seen a fight.” She was sitting in the greenroom, curled up on a mottled brown-leather couch. “Sometimes,” she said, resting her head on her knees, “you’ll finish your set and a kid will come up to you and be, like, ‘I got kicked out of my house. I have forty dollars, and I bought this ticket.’ It really fucking changes things when you hear that.” She seemed offended when I asked if it ever felt like too much to bear. “I think part of the job of an artist is to be a listener. It’s not just about talking and playing and performing. It doesn’t take anything away from me—it gives me a reason to do this other than myself.” A week after Market Hotel, Straus was ready to let me see her home. “I need to smoke a blunt,” she said, leading me through a manicured courtyard with patio furniture and hydrangeas, where she sometimes inflates a kiddie pool for her dog, Raz, a six-year-old border-collie mutt who met us at the door. (The previous owners had named her after her affinity for raspberry White Claw.) Straus knelt down and let Raz kiss her face. “I’ve had her since she was five months old,” Straus told me, massaging the floppy ears with her thumbs. She led me upstairs so she could change into a pair of athletic shorts. I asked if the room had been her parents’. “Just my mom,” she said quickly. Behind her, the bed was neatly made, and an A.C. unit ruffled the leaves of a plant that hung off her armoire. When Straus got into U.S.C., her mother relocated with her third husband to Hawaii, where she keeps horses. Straus moved into her dorm room with the help of her manager rather than a parent. “She comes to New York a lot, and we talk on the phone every day,” Straus said. “But it is far. She missed the last show, which I know was hard for her.” On her upper arm is a tattoo of a bridle bit under the word “MOM.” Afterward, Straus rolled her contraband at the kitchen island and lit up, offering me a hit. (I politely declined.) On the walls hung White Stripes, T. Rex, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs posters. In her living room, PlayStation controllers, bundles of sage, a medieval sword, and packs of Zyn were shelved together under a glass coffee table. A nine-foot-tall stand of books—among them, the collected poems of Emily Dickinson, a Lou Reed biography, and “Gimpel the Fool,” by Isaac Bashevis Singer—was topped with a stack of wigs. “There are wigs everywhere, if you want to wear one,” she said, following my gaze. Would it make her more comfortable if I made a fool of myself? She told me that it would. Scattered among novelty objects, including a wax candle of a woman’s crotch and a signed portrait of RuPaul, were accolades from her career: late-night-show call sheets, an “S.N.L.” plaque, and the framed platinum vinyl for “1950.” For every measure of her efforts, there has to be a punch line to undercut it, or perhaps to make it seem all the more impressive. She kicked back on a sectional, letting Raz splay across her lap, and I asked what she hoped people might take away from “Girl Violence.” She hit the blunt contemplatively, and then answered. “I hope that it just feels like I’m having fun.” ♦

Fortune’s 2025 ranking of the world’s 100 most powerful people in business came out this morning. Unlike revenue or market cap, power is a more complex concept.

By those measures, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came in No. 1 on this year’s list. In addition to creating specialized computer chips that are coveted by companies developing artificial intelligence, he is on the front lines of a technology that is changing the global business landscape itself. Power is not permanent. Elon Musk topped last year’s list not only because of his roles at Tesla, SpaceX, xAI and X, but also because of his work in the Trump Administration. That changed. This year, Musk is No. 4 on the list. Power is also relative. Companies and leaders grow strong when they have a worthy rival to measure themselves against. Thus Jensen Huang has AMD CEO Lisa Su, his first cousin once removed, on his heels as a powerful chipmaker. As part of this year’s package, we look at how rivalries in key industries are playing out. You can check out the full list here. Federal grand jury will probe Trump’s “Russia hoax” allegations Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a U.S. attorney to empanel a grand jury to investigate the intelligence community’s handling of allegations that Moscow had influence over President Trump’s 2016 election campaign. No targets were named, but the investigation will likely look at Obama-era cabinet members such as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey. Trump threatens yet more tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases India got a 25% tariff rate in the last round, but the president is angry that India continues to buy Russian oil. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,” he said on Trump Social. India said this was hypocrisy because the EU continues to trade with Russia and faces no similar sanctions. Palantir delivers blowout quarter Sales were up almost 50% to nearly $1 billion, beating expectations. Net income was $327 million, up 144%. CEO Alex Karp lifted guidance for Q3. The stock closed up 4% yesterday and rose another 5% in overnight trading. “We’re planning to grow our revenue … while decreasing our number of people,” CEO Alex Karp told CNBC. “This is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.” Deutsche Bank CEO approved trades that were later investigated Christian Sewing approved a €1.5 billion deal that was later investigated by Italian authorities, resulting in six of his former colleagues being sentenced to prison on false accounting charges. The convictions were later overturned on appeal. Deutsche Bank denied there was any wrongdoing on Sewing’s part: “Any allegation of a conflict of interest involving Christian Sewing is completely unfounded,” it told the FT. Trump wants to ban “debanking” The president is planning to issue an executive order directing bank regulators to investigate whether banks deny accounts to people with right-wing opinions or those involved in crypto, to see whether such bans might violate credit, consumer, or antitrust laws. JPMorgan strategist sounds alarm on labor demographic issues David Kelly, JPMorgan Asset Management’s Chief Global Strategist, warned on Monday that immigration restrictions and a growing elderly population could mean “no growth in workers at all” in the next 5 years. Kelly warned that cutting rates could lead to wage and price inflation instead of propelling economic growth. Anthropic CEO on Meta’s poaching Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says the company’s employees have been less eager to accept poaching offers from Meta and the company won’t make competing offers because that would jeopardize company culture. “We are not willing to compromise our compensation principles, our principles of fairness, to respond individually to these offers,” Amodei recently said on the Big Technology Podcast. S&P 500 futures were up 0.13% this morning, premarket, after the index closed up 1.47% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.3% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.35% in early trading.

Title: Rare is getting a limited edition 8BitDo controller for its 40th anniversary, and I can't help but feel bittersweet about it

A pyrrhic victory When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's definitely been a trying year for Rare, but there is at least something to shout about for fans of the legendary Twycross-based developer in the form of a limited edition 8BitDo controller. This 8BitDo Ultimate controller for Xbox consoles and PC has been spotted over at Amazon (via Eurogamer), and is intended to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary. No release date has been revealed yet, and it seems like it'll only be available to US audiences at present. It's definitely one of the nicest limited edition 8BitDo controllers to date, featuring a blue and yellow color scheme reminiscent of the developer's logo. It's also emblazoned with iconography from some of its most renowned titles, including Sea of Thieves and Banjo-Kazooie. There's even a banana there as a cheeky nod to the Donkey Kong Country series as well as Donkey Kong 64. If you're unfamiliar with the 8BitDo controller, it's a bit of a revelation in the third-party gamepad space. It features Hall effect thumbsticks made to combat drift, two remappable buttons for secondary inputs, and a 2.4GHz dongle for wireless connectivity. The 8BitDo Ultimate also includes a charging dock in the box, for a clever and easy way to keep the pad topped up. I consider it to be one of the best Xbox controllers and best Nintendo Switch controllers on the market today. I can't help but feel bittersweet about the reveal of this controller, though. While Sea of Thieves is a tremendous game and continues to enjoy a dedicated player base, Rare's 40th year hasn't exactly been smooth-sailing. The developer's next game, Everwild, was recently canceled. This is in spite of comments from Xbox boss Phil Spencer back in February of this year, where he claimed the game's development was progressing. Rare also created the Perfect Dark series, an immersive sim-esque reboot of which was also shuttered along with its developer The Initiative amidst another round of Xbox Game Studios layoffs.

Amazon made a big splash in the podcasting industry in early 2021 when it bought studio Wondery for a reported $300m. Four and a half years on, however, some changes are afoot. Bloomberg reported that Amazon is “breaking up” Wondery’s operations, splitting its shows and remaining team between the company’s Audible subsidiary and a new ‘creator services’ division. Remaining team? Yes, layoffs are part of this: around 110 people are losing their jobs according to the report, which painted the move as “an acknowledgement that Amazon’s big push into podcasts hasn’t worked out as planned”. This certainly isn’t Amazon giving up on podcasts, which are an increasingly-prominent part of its Amazon Music service, as well as featuring on Audible. The fact that Amazon Music, Audible and Twitch sit under the same umbrella within Amazon – overseen by VP of audio, Twitch and games Steve Boom – hints at potential to do more in the sweet spot between podcasting, video and influencers. That’s something Spotify and YouTube are also both leaning heavily into in 2025.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Lines are being drawn in Amazon and Google’s evolving rivalry

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Uncertainties over the impact of U.S. import tariffs, as well as the disruption of AI, are upending the global economic order. It might seem intuitive that Big Tech (as a collective) will be the big beneficiaries of such trends, but as the recent raft of quarterly earnings releases demonstrates, such players are repositioning, and the impact on Madison Avenue could potentially be seismic. Google-owner Alphabet was the first across the line, and in last week’s analysis, Digiday noted how ad tech is a declining priority for the Big Tech giant of Madison Avenue, with AI dominating Wall Street analysts’ questions (see right). As the remainder of ‘GAFAM’ – that’s Apple, Facebook (or Meta), Amazon, and Microsoft – followed suit with their results for the period, the AI-intrigue continued. However, for those paying close attention to how their priorities will impact the marketing and advertising market, there were some breadcrumbs pointing toward potential political ruptures, given how such players account for almost two-thirds of U.S. ad spend. Firstly, it’s worth clarifying how Google is far from a shrinking willow in the advertising market, given its $96.4 billion Q2 revenue haul – it’s still the clear pace-setter on Madison Avenue. And while its Google Network business, a.k.a. what was DoubleClick, is in continued decline, core platforms like Search and YouTube grew 12 percent and 13 percent, respectively, with analysts noting how it has shifted from an enabler of the ecosystem to a premium media owner, with its AI overviews also setting a new paradigm. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg used this juncture to launch his “Personal Superintelligence” manifesto – for shareholders’ sake, let’s hope this one receives a warmer welcome than his metaverse prophecy. However, glib observations aside, Meta’s 3.4 billion-strong audience helped generate $47.5 billion during the same reporting period, up 22 percent year over year — a strong performance, indeed — with the Facebook and Instagram owner also underscoring its AI efforts. Ahead of any further analysis, it is worth reminding ourselves that Alphabet’s latest earnings suggest a strategic shift away from third-party ad tech dominance toward owned-and-operated platforms (not to mention AI), and it’s this shift in priorities that may focus Amazon Advertising’s energies in the near-to-mid-term. In its Q2 earnings update, Amazon reported $167.7 billion in revenue, a 12 percent increase from the year-ago period, according to the company’s latest earnings disclosure. According to the company’s executives, advertising played a key role in driving growth, a contrast to what several analysts deemed a worrying outlook for its AI investments. Understandably, Wall Street queries focused on hot-button issues, such as whether tariffs will impact Amazon’s core e-commerce business and its prospects in the ongoing AI land grab, with such developments casting an interesting light on its growing ads business. On the company’s subsequent earnings call, which took place ahead of the crunch tariff deadline from the U.S. administration, Amazon’s executives emphasized the unpredictability of the situation, with CEO Andy Jassy observing, “In the first half, we just haven’t seen diminished demand.” Given the broader AI narrative, many analysts’ questions centered on its AWS vertical, which generated $30.9 billion in revenue, a 17.5 percent year-over-year increase. Notably, Morgan Stanley’s Brian Novak bluntly articulated the perception that “AWS is falling behind with Gen AI.” Evidently, Jassy’s response did little to reverse such notions, with Amazon’s stock price dropping by 7 percent in the hours after the call. Meanwhile, the online giant’s advertising business had a significant impact on its bottom line, contributing $15.7 billion, a 22 percent year-over-year increase, or (more pertinently to the matter at hand) accounting for 9.4 percent of Amazon’s total revenue for the period. As Amazon CFO, Brian Lioswski, noted, “Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North American [and] international segments.” Note how this contrasts with the way AWS margins “saw headwinds” during the reporting period, and as Lioswski also noted, “We expect AWS margins to fluctuate over time.” Amazon executives also highlighted some of its tentpole Cannes Lions announcements, such as its integration with Roku. All of this is understandable, particularly as analysts take an increasingly austere view of AWS’ outlook; after all, the high margins of digital advertising have created some of the biggest Big Tech behemoths. And that’s why the recent emergence that Amazon has abruptly cut its Google Shopping ad spending is causing speculation: could this be the start of a tit-for-tat trade war (of sorts) between a Big tech pairing who also happen to be two of Madison Avenue’s biggest spenders? One of the biggest stories on Madison Avenue over the past 12 months has been Amazon, specifically as an advertiser, awarding separate parts of its media account to different holding companies worldwide. It’s well understood that the unspoken horse-trading of winning such large accounts – separate estimates put Big Tech’s marketing spend in the range of $20 billion or more per year – involves a degree of deal-making. In the case of Amazon, several Digiday sources have speculated that awarding such a lucrative account would have involved an implied, if not outright stated, expectation that a certain percentage of spend will be channeled in the direction of its accompanying media business. If this is the case, will Google look to retaliate? Furthermore, more puckish observers might note that Google’s account review, which took place in 2021, saw it consolidate its media business within WPP’s Essence – the same business unit that won Amazon’s media business in Europe and APAC.Are these shifting tectonic plates signs of a brewing storm between the two that could have a scaled downstream impact? “Payor reliability is slipping — only 43 percent paid on time more often than not, with ‘always-on-time’ payors down to just 13 percent.” — OAREX evp Nick Carrabbia cites statistics from the company’s H1 2025 Payments Study. As YouTube Shorts reaches 200 billion views, advertisers increase their investment Brands now find Shorts a cost-effective way to reach audiences absent on TikTok and Instagram, with low CPMs around $5 — that’s half the cost of Meta Reels or TikTok, according to sources – proving a big draw. Enhanced monetization tools and creator incentives have also fueled growth, with advertisers accelerating their reallocation of budget to Shorts for more efficient reach and performance. Inside the search rumor swirling around Meta Amid a changing internet landscape, the old adage that “Google is for Search, Facebook is for Social…” is losing traction. Media buyers are inquiring about Meta’s new offering in this landscape, with sources expecting a search product to be introduced soon. YouTube is dominating TV viewership — but Amazon’s Prime Video is on pace to be a bigger cash cow Business Insider’s James Faris and Lucia Moses further chart the growing rivalry between the Big tech duo, with the living room screen seemingly one of the most intense battlegrounds.

Title: Has The Crypto Market Bottomed? Analyst Says ‘This Is It’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/has-the-crypto-market-bottomed/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T01:00:50Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Macro analyst Alex Krüger says the weekend’s sell-off has likely marked a tradable low for the crypto market, arguing that the move closely mirrors the 2024 “August crash” that bottomed on a Monday. “I see the current move as a smaller scale replay of last year’s August crash (which bottomed on Monday),” Krüger wrote on late-Friday in a post on X, adding that he would “be looking to add to longs on Monday, ideally before the US cash open,” if the overnight session remained panicky. He framed the decline as a classic shakeout rather than the start of a new downtrend. Krüger’s read hinges on macro first, crypto second. He notes that 2024’s August break came in a sequence—BoJ tightening, a hawkish FOMC, then weak payrolls—and he sees the present sequence as “similar.” There was no carry-trade impulse this time, he said, but markets digested a modestly hawkish Fed, mixed Big Tech earnings, a hotter-than-expected PCE inflation print, and finally a “horrid” US payrolls report—after which risk assets slid in tandem and crypto tracked equities lower. The latest PCE data, released July 31, showed headline inflation accelerating to 2.6% year over year and core PCE at 2.8%, a notch above forecasts—what Krüger summarized as “slightly hot.” Earnings tape-bombs reinforced the risk-off mood. Microsoft and Meta beat estimates and initially rallied, while Apple’s reception was cooler and Amazon’s results were “very poorly received,” with AMZN sliding about 7–8% as investors questioned AWS’s momentum. Coinbase’s report landed at the other extreme for crypto beta: revenue missed expectations and the stock fell, a backdrop Krüger called “dreadful” for sentiment. “Even though the aforementioned concerns emboldened bears, this week’s move has been mainly a macro story, given how crypto traded mostly in line with equity indices,” he wrote. He also flagged an unusual political and geopolitical coda to this weekend’s rout. After the weak jobs report—plus an unusually stark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, May and June were revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs—markets lurched, and the White House’s subsequent decision to reposition two US nuclear submarines amid heated exchanges with Moscow added to stress, he said. Kremlin officials later tried to downplay escalation risk, calling the submarine moves “routine.” Krüger called the nuclear rhetoric and presidential barbs at the Fed “noise” for markets, but said the combination likely helped flush leveraged positions into the close. On crypto-specific drivers, Krüger listed a cluster of narratives that, in his view, amplified bearish conviction without changing the macro center of gravity: disappointing Coinbase results; debate around whether MicroStrategy could curtail its at-the-market equity issuance, limiting incremental BTC buys; questions about the sustainability of “DATs” (digital-asset treasury companies) tied to ETH; and, on the other side of the ledger, the SEC’s new “Project Crypto,” a policy push to modernize securities rules and move more market infrastructure on-chain—“an extremely bullish development that should drive inflows later in the year,” as he put it. The SEC’s chair outlined “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution” last week, framing tokenization and on-chain market plumbing as a regulatory priority. Krüger’s base case is timing-driven: either crypto “bottomed after today’s close, given the sheer violence of that final dump, or will be bottoming together with equities on Monday.” In his plan, the trigger to add risk was early Monday—assuming the overnight remained disorderly—on the view that the analog to August 2024 would rhyme at the turn of the week. “A violent shakeout,” he wrote, not a regime change. He remains constructive into the fourth quarter, citing three pillars: a still-solid US economy, the start of Fed rate cuts, and a steadily improving regulatory climate that should broaden institutional and retail participation. Policy churn could amplify that path. Krüger pointed to Fed Governor Adriana Kugler’s resignation—effective this month—as a potentially market-relevant shift because it hands the White House an earlier-than-expected Board vacancy, and to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh’s call for a new “Treasury–Fed accord” as a signpost for constraints on central-bank independence. On Monday he added, “This will prove to be very important later on,” citing Warsh’s argument about “limits on the Fed’s independence to help the govt with its finances.” Whether those institutional dynamics translate into earlier or deeper rate cuts remains open, but markets have already moved to price odds to 85% for a September cut following the payrolls miss. Krüger’s longer arc is unabashedly bullish but explicitly conditional on the macro. “I remain bullish on crypto into Q4,” he wrote, while warning that ETH-linked treasury plays could “lose momentum dramatically” later in the year if goods inflation re-accelerates as corporates pass tariffs through. He set a one-year Bitcoin target for mid-2026 at $200,000–$250,000—“extreme, but possible”—on the premise that a more dovish Fed in 2026 would coincide with ongoing adoption. For now, he is treating last week’s cascade as an echo of 2024’s Monday bottom.

Title: The Proof That Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner Hasn't Lost His Magic Touch

ByCaroline Reid ByCaroline Reid, Senior Contributor. Media companies don't come much more historic than Disney. The eponymous studio was founded by Walt Disney and his brother Roy 101 years ago and, to this day, only two other executives have been as synonymous with the company as they were. Disney's current chief executive Bob Iger will forever be associated with the Mouse thanks to his acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox. They turned Disney into a titan which consistently ranks as the highest-grossing studio in the movie industry. However, neither Iger nor even Walt himself laid the modern-day foundations that Disney is built on. Iger's predecessor Michael Eisner can take the credit for that and his track record at Disney really is the fairest of them all. Few executives have cast as powerful a spell on the entertainment industry as Eisner. When he became Disney's chief executive on September 22, 1984 its stock price was just $1.24 and the studio was in the doldrums. However, by the time he handed over the hot seat to Iger 21 years later, each share was worth $23.80 and Disney was the world's biggest media company. Impressive as this is, it isn't the clearest evidence that Eisner really does have a magic touch. The New York native joined Disney after an eight-year stint as chief executive of Paramount where he launched ground-breaking movies like Saturday Night Fever, Beverly Hills Cop and Raiders of the Lost Ark. At the time, Disney was a shadow of what it is today. Construction costs at Walt Disney World in Orlando had spiralled and attempts to make more modern movies had led to forgettable live-action films such as sci-fi flop The Black Hole and Condorman, starring Michael Crawford. Combined with a failure to focus on new animation, repeated re-releases of its back catalogue and declining quality standards at its theme parks, Disney was at risk. "They lost the company basically by overspending on Walt Disney World," explained Eisner in an interview with this author. "People don’t remember that but Walt, and particularly his brother, coming out of the Depression, were afraid of debt, so instead of using debt to build a pretty much over budget theme park in Florida, they used their equity. They sold. They lost control. They also way overspent and they didn’t have the attendance so between losing control, not having the attendance, not doing new animation, having very few live-action pictures, re-releasing the old library theatrically prior to home video, the company was at risk." He added that "it was being torn apart. It could have been over in six weeks. When we walked down Main Street the second day in Disneyland I realised what a valuable asset it was." Eisner knew what was needed. "[George] With a wave of his magic wand, Eisner brought Disney back to its roots of hand-drawn animation yielding beloved favourites like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. "We concentrated on reinvigorating animation, particularly musical animation," he explained. "We obviously made an early deal with Lucas for Star Tours and Raiders of the Lost Ark because we had no recent movies for which to put in the parks. We then had a lot of recent movies, whether it was the Roger Rabbits, or the Aladdins, or Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King or whatever." Eisner then commissioned rides based on them as well as merchandise to sell in the theme parks so the films acted as promotion for Disney’s resorts which in turn drove the sale of toys that would fuel kids’ interest in the movies. Eisner doubled down on this spellbinding cycle by building two new theme parks in Florida as well as others in California, Paris and Hong Kong. The 1990s were a golden era for the theme park industry and Disney was at the vanguard of it. So much so in fact that it was referred to as the Disney Decade. As Eisner explained, "we went to Europe. We went to Japan. We started negotiating in Hong Kong. We opened in Hong Kong. All that before I left." In turn, Hong Kong Disneyland paved the way for the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016 which, until recently, was the studio's latest park. That only changed in May when it announced that one of its outposts is coming to Abu Dhabi's Yas Island after Iger signed a deal with Mohamed Al Zaabi, the trailblazing chief executive of Miral, the world's leading theme park operator outside Disney and Universal Studios. The impact of Eisner's expansion was magnified by his emphasis on quality and details. He describes his legacy as "the strategy of excellence. The strategy of whatever you do, do it really well." It is no exaggeration. When Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney as it was then known) was being developed, Eisner amassed a team of the world's best designers to make it the most immersive theme park ever built. They included Eddie Sotto, who meticulously created the park’s turn-of-the-century themed Main Street, and Tom Morris, the architect of its majestic castle. The clearest evidence they succeeded is the fact that the Disneyland Paris is still Europe’s most-visited theme park even though a new attraction hasn’t been built there for several decades. As this report revealed, launching Disneyland Paris may actually be the studio’s best-ever deal. Eisner’s effect didn’t just extend to expansion. "We improved the food at Walt Disney World which was terrible in 1984. We built 30,000 hotel rooms, high-quality hotels, which they didn’t have - they had two." He added that “we did that in architecture. We built 80 buildings around the world at Disney. They had never done this before at Disney, they had always done it internally. We went with the best architects around the world.” Eisner’s expansion helped Disney to become the world’s most-visited theme park operator with 142.1 million guests streaming through its turnstiles in 2023 according to the latest data from the Themed Entertainment Association. That's just the start. In order to ensure that the studio didn’t get left behind by the rise of computer-animated movies, Eisner signed a pioneering deal in 1991 to distribute Pixar’s modern-day fairytales. Its films like Finding Nemo and Toy Story grossed a total of $3.4 billion during Eisner’s tenure paving the way for Disney’s $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar in 2006. Ten years after he took over the top job at Disney, Eisner created a new category of entertainment when he gave the green light to a Broadway show based on Beauty and the Beast. It opened at the Palace Theatre in New York in 1994 and was such a success that it set the stage for other shows based on The Lion King, Aladdin, and Frozen. Since then, Disney Theatrical Group’s 10 titles have been seen by around 230 million theatergoers in 38 countries with The Lion King alone becoming the most successful show in theatre history playing to more than 115 million people in 100 cities. Instead of resting on his laurels, Eisner pushed the boat out and in 1998 launched Disney Cruise Line which now generates more than $2 billion of annual revenue as I revealed in British newspaper City A.M. Eisner declines to comment on the future of Disney and possible successors for Iger who he is in very close and frequent contact with. However, Eisner is happy to look back and says that his turnaround of the company was driven by “new content, invigorated management, diverse management, which we didn't have when I got there, great assets that Walt created that you had to build upon. No one big thing to put the company at risk. Motion pictures that were less than the industry average. All of those things together were a result of what turned Disney around. Going to Broadway, which has been a giant success. And I think the businesses that we put together in those 21 years are still the businesses that Disney is [today].” As the chart below and data here shows, by the time that Eisner stepped down on September 30, 2005, Disney’s stock price was $23.80 which was a staggering 19.2 times higher than when he joined the company. It comfortably makes him the most successful boss in Disney's history as its stock price only rose 5.4 times during Iger's initial term which ran until February 25, 2020 when each share was worth $128.19. Former theme parks chief Bob Chapek took over the driving seat and although the stock price hit an all-time high of $201.91 under him, by the time he handed the reins back to Iger on November 20, 2022, it had slumped to just $97.58 which was lower than when he became Disney's boss. When Eisner stepped down he could have retired thanks to his sizeable pile of Disney stock which has soared even higher in value under Iger, closing at $119.35 today. Instead, he built up a boutique media company called Tornante after seeing signs showing the word on a cycling trip through Italy. Meaning 'hairpin turn’, the name was fitting as Tornante headed in a completely different direction to Disney by producing hit adult animation series on Netflix such as Bojack Horseman and Tuca and Bertie. Despite his close ties to streaming, Eisner is still a big believer in movie theaters as this reporter revealed in the Daily Mail in 2023. He has also recently written a book called Camp, about the lessons he learned at summer camp, and has diversified outside media. Tornante has made investments in prize-draw company Omaze and trading card business Topps, which was sold to Fanatics in 2022 for an estimated $500 million. However, they were just trailers for the main event. Soon after Eisner turned 75 in 2017 he took perhaps his biggest swing yet when he acquired British soccer club Portsmouth FC. The team was founded in 1898 and was experiencing one of the toughest times in its history. In 2012 the historic team had fallen two tiers below the top flight Premier League after collapsing into administration – the British equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy – for the second time in two years. Its plight was so serious that it had to be rescued by its fans before its real life prince charming came along. Eisner had some experience in sports as under his leadership Disney bought the Los Angeles Angels baseball team and founded the Anaheim Ducks NHL squad which went on to win the World Series and the Stanley Cup respectively. Accordingly, making a success of a soccer team may sound like a cinch, especially for someone who built up the world’s biggest media company. However, Eisner wasn't willing to buy his way to the top and burn up blockbuster losses. There is good reason for this. Eisner was one of the first of a string of American celebrities to invest in British soccer teams. He was followed by Ryan Reynolds, Michael B Jordan and Will Ferrell who invested in Wrexham FC, AFC Bournemouth and Leeds United respectively. Eisner wasn’t jumping on a bandwagon and instead bought Portmouth FC, or Pompey as it is affectionately known, because he is a devoted soccer fan himself. He even invited Ferrell to matches leading to his investment in Leeds. Eisner’s goal is getting Portsmouth back into the prestigious Premier League by building it up organically. What's more, he wanted it to be the springboard for a behind the scenes show along the lines of the hit Ryan Reynolds Disney+ docuseries Welcome to Wrexham. Eisner revealed the rationale behind it in a 2019 interview with this author for the Daily Mail at his office in Beverly Hills. When asked why a media boss would want to own a soccer team he replied “football is the most direct [investment of my] media strategy. It is the most obvious and the clearest as opposed to the least obvious.” He explained that “content, in my opinion, is still the essential ingredient in the media and having content is still the most important thing in media...Any platform that is appealing to an audience has to have something that lights up the Christmas Tree. And what lights up the Sky Christmas Tree or the ESPN Christmas Tree is live sports.” Known as appointment viewing because fans have to tune in at a specific time to watch it live, sport commands premium prices by broadcasters. "The only thing that demands viewing when it happens is sports. Yes, you have replays and you have all sorts of analysis of sports but if you know the score at the end of the game, the rest is really just icing on the cake." The drama of live sport also yields immensely passionate fans who crave content about their heroes. It explains why Welcome to Wrexham has been so popular but it wasn't the first mover in the streaming space. That accolade goes to Sunderland Til I Die, a 2018 Netflix series about the disputes and dilemmas behind the scenes at Sunderland AFC which had just been relegated from the English Football League Championship to League One. As Eisner explained, "all you have to do is watch Sunderland Til I Die on Netflix to understand the emotion of a team going into dissent." In fact, it was this show that convinced the actor Rob McElhenney to buy a soccer team leading to his investment in Wrexham with Reynolds. At the end of last season Wrexham was promoted to the Championship, one step below the Premier League. The odds seemed stacked against Eisner getting Portsmouth back to the top as English soccer is full of team owners who are prepared to pour billions into their squads in a bid to win on the pitch and earn international acclaim. However, afer seven calendar years in charge, his happy ending is within striking distance. Portsmouth won the League One title in the 2023-2024 season and was promoted to the Championship after a 12-year absence. Since then, the team has retained its place there and will make a renewed charge for promotion to the Premier League when the upcoming season gets underway on Friday. Perhaps indicating Eisner’s confidence in its chances, he recently announced that Portsmouth is planning to film behind-the-scenes content over the coming year. It is a momentous milestone as it will give him the content he envisaged back in 2019. Most impressively, Eisner has managed to get this far without burning up blockbuster losses and putting the team in jeopardy. Quite the opposite actually as analysis of its latest financial statements reveals that the team now has the strongest capital structure in its 127-year history with no debt and net assets of $33.5 million (£26.5 million) as of June 30, 2024. Its net asset value has increased more than five fold since the supporters took over the club in 2013 which shows how strong the business has become. The metric is calculated by deducting a company’s liabilities from the value of its assets so the higher the value, the lower the level of risk. The net result can be a sign of impending peril and, testimony to this, Portsmouth had net liabilities of $93.8 million (£47.5 million) in 2008 before it collapsed less than two years later. Since Eisner bought the team its cash reserves have risen 16.3% to $3.9 million (£3.1 million) which also gives strong confidence in the business. Its success has been shared amongst its staff as their pay has almost doubled to $13.4 million (£10.6 million) since Eisner took control even though employee numbers have decreased by 26.1% to 275. Staff and players were paid bonuses after the team was promoted and this partly fueled a $7.1 million (£5.6 million) net loss last year which pales in comparison to the red ink burned up by its counterparts in the Premier League. Everton FC for example reported a $67.3 million (£53.2 million) net loss last year whilst Tottenham Hotspur lost $33.1 million (£26.2 million). Both clubs have hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue as they share in the proceeds of the league’s broadcast deals which are amongst the biggest in world soccer. It explains why Portsmouth's revenue is far lower though it rose 8.9% last year to $17.2 million (£13.6 million), the highest level since Eisner bought the team. Last year alone, matchday takings increased 6.3% to $8.7 million (£6.9 million) whilst broadcasting revenue rose by almost double that percentage to $3.2 million (£2.5 million). The increased broadcast exposure gave a 21.4% boost to the team’s commercial and sponsorship revenue with partners including Nike and Uber Eats paying a total of $2.3 million (£1.8 million) in 2024. It was a family effort as the team is run by Eisner’s dynamic entrepreneur sons Anders, founder of organic foods brand Good Culture, producer Eric and director Breck who made 2005 adventure film Sahara starring Matthew McConaughey and Penélope Cruz. They are accompanied by talented managers including chief executive Andrew Cullen, chief marketing officer Matthew Barker, chief commercial officer Mark Judges and the coach John Mousinho. Although Eisner’s spending on Portsmouth hasn't been unchained, he hasn't left the club wanting. Its 2018 financial statements revealed that "the purchase of the club by Tornante resulted in an injection of £10 million [$13.2 million] new working capital which bolstered the balance sheet to a new positive total of £12.6 million [$16.6 million] net assets." It didn't stop there. As of June last year the Eisner family had invested $46.8 million (£37 million) in the club including $24 million (£19 million) alone on the redevelopment of its Fratton Park stadium. This began in June 2021, well ahead of the club's 125th anniversary, and was handled by Robert Stern who Eisner knew through his work at Disney. Stern designed Disney's Feature Animation Building in Burbank, California, with its soaring blue replica of Mickey Mouse's pointy sorcerer's hat. Stern was also behind Walt Disney World's lavish Yacht and Beach Club Resorts, which look like sprawling New England mansions, and their counterpart at Disneyland Paris, the Newport Bay Club. His work on Fratton Park had a magic touch as average attendance increased by around 1,000 to 18,952 in the year to June 30, 2024 and on February 17 last year Portsmouth had its first crowd of more than 20,000 spectators in 13 years. Its latest financial statements add that "in the second half of the season, we capped our season tickets to 15,000 and introduced a season ticket waiting list at Fratton Park for the first time in many years." In turn, the surge in spectators led to record hospitality kiosk and merchandising sales which is perhaps as significant a home run as the team's success on the pitch. "It is a game about winning. It is a game about progressing upwards. It is a game about strategy. It is a game about intelligent management," says Eisner. "Just like in the entertainment business."

(NASDAQ: AVGO), a global leader in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today announced it is now shipping the Jericho4 ethernet fabric router — a purpose-built platform for the next generation of distributed AI infrastructure. Designed to interconnect over one million XPUs across multiple data centers, Jericho4 breaks through traditional scaling limits with unmatched bandwidth, security, and lossless performance. With the Tomahawk 6, Tomahawk Ultra and Jericho4, Broadcom offers a complete networking portfolio for HPC and AI. As AI models grow in size and complexity, the infrastructure requirements exceed the power and physical limits of a single data center. Distributing XPUs across multiple facilities — each provisioned with tens to hundreds of megawatts of power — requires a new class of router, optimized for very high-bandwidth, secure and lossless transport across regional distances. “The Jericho4 family is engineered to extend AI-scale Ethernet fabrics beyond individual data centers, supporting congestion-free RoCE and 3.2 Tbps HyperPort for unprecedented interconnect efficiency,” said Ram Velaga, senior vice president and general manager of Broadcom’s Core Switching Group. “Scale Up Ethernet (SUE), Tomahawk Ultra, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4 all play a very important role in enabling large scale distributed computing systems within a rack, across racks, and across data centers in an open and interoperable way.” A single Jericho4 system scales to 36,000 HyperPorts, each operating at 3.2 Tb/s, with deep buffering, line-rate MACsec, and RoCE transport over 100km+ distances. Broadcom’s 3.2T HyperPort technology consolidates four 800GE links into a single logical port — eliminating load balancing inefficiencies, boosting utilization by up to 70%, and streamlining traffic flow across large fabrics. Thanks to deep buffering and intelligent congestion control, Jericho4 ensures lossless RoCE across 100km+ enabling truly distributed AI infrastructure unconstrained by power and space limitations at a single location. Jericho4 supports MACsec encryption on every port at full speed to protect data moving between data centers, delivering strong security without compromising performance — even at the highest traffic loads. Manufactured on a 3nm process, Jericho4 features Broadcom’s advanced 200G PAM4 SerDes with industry-leading reach. This eliminates the need for extra components like retimers, resulting in lower power usage, reduced cost, and higher system reliability.

Stock market rally today has captured Wall Street’s attention as the Dow Jones jumped 500 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posting strong gains. This sharp rebound follows a weak U.S. payroll report, which has increased hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts as early as September. With only 73,000 jobs added in July and unemployment ticking up, investors now expect multiple interest rate cuts by the end of 2025. President Donald Trump’s strong reaction to the data, including the firing of the BLS chief, adds political drama as markets shift.

Title: Berger Montague PC Investigating Claims on Behalf of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) After Class Action Filing

August 04, 2025 15:43 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National plaintiffs’ law firm Berger Montague PC announces a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) (“Novo” or the “Company”) on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of Novo from May 7, 2025 through July 28, 2025 (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Novo securities during the Class Period may, no later than September 30, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Novo, headquartered in Denmark, is a global pharmaceutical company. According to the Complaint, the Company is alleged to have understated the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion, which has allowed persistent use of compounded alternatives to Novo’s pharmaceutical products. Novo allegedly overstated the likelihood that patients using less expensive compounded drugs would switch to its branded products, thus greatly overstating the Company’s ability to sustain long-term growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook for fiscal 2025. The Company cited slower-than-expected growth for both Wegovy® and Ozempic®, attributing the guidance revision to continued competition from compounded GLP-1 products. Following this announcement, Novo’s stock price dropped from a closing price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to a close of $53.94 per share on July 29—a decline of approximately 21.83% in a single day.

Time Published: 2025-08-04T18:29:55Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares were up about 2% in recent trading after shedding about a third of their value last week, when the company cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO, leading Wall Street analysts to downgrade the stock. Since hitting a record high in June last year, Novo Nordisk shares have lost roughly two-thirds of their value, pressured by increasing competition from rival Eli Lilly’s (LLY) weight-loss drugs and challenges during trials of the company’s next-generation obesity drugs. Below, we take a closer look at Novo Nordisk’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching after last week’s dramatic sell-off. With last week's drop, Novo Nordisk shares resumed their steep downtrend on above-average trading volume, indicating selling conviction from larger market participants. The sell-off coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) falling to its lowest levels since early May, signaling weakening price momentum, though the indicator neared its oversold threshold, increasing the chances for short-term bounces. It’s also worth noting that the 50-week moving average continues to converge toward the 200-week MA, potentially setting the stage for an ominous death cross, a bearish pattern that forecasts lower prices. Let’s identify two major support levels on Novo Nordisk’s chart worth watching if selling resumes this week and also point out several key overhead areas to monitor during potential recovery efforts. The first major lower level to watch sits around $36. This area would likely provide support near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between October 2020 and April 2021. A more significant move lower could see the shares test lower support at the $29 level. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding price action on the chart between January 2018 and April 2020. An initial recovery effort could see the shares climb to overhead resistance around $60. The price may encounter selling pressure in this area near the prominent April trough and April 2022 peak. A more bullish upswing opens the door for a rally toward $78. Investors who have bought Novo Nordisk shares at lower levels may decide to lock in profits in this location near the June peak, which closely aligns with the completion of a pullback in July 2023.

Title: Amazon layoffs: 110 jobs to be cut as part of Wondery podcast studio overhaul

Amazon.com is restructuring the Wondery podcast studio by shifting its award-winning narrative podcasts such as "Business Wars" to Audible and consolidating creator-led shows into a new unit, according to a memo seen by Reuters. About 110 employees will be laid off as part of the process, while many Wondery employees will transition to other parts of Amazon, the company said in an emailed statement on Monday. Wondery CEO Jen Sargent will depart the company following a transition period, the memo said. Intense competition in the expensive podcast industry as well as a growing focus on creator-led video content have prompted audio streaming companies including Spotify to diversify their podcasts as they look to lower costs and attract more users to their platforms. "As video podcasting has grown in popularity, we have learned that creator-led, video-integrated shows have different audience needs and require distinct discovery, growth and monetization strategies compared to audio-first, narrative series," Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch and games at Amazon, wrote in the memo. Wondery was acquired by Amazon in 2021 and has seen podcast revenue quadruple since then as the studio expanded its slate to include video podcasts and creator-driven series, according to the memo. Under the new structure, Wondery's narrative podcast studio - home to shows such as "Dr. Death" and "American Scandal" - along with the Wondery subscription service, will move to Audible, the e-commerce giant's audio platform. Its creator-focused podcast team that produces shows including "Mind the Game", "New Heights", and "Armchair Expert" will join a new Creator Services group within Amazon's Talent Services division. This new team will continue to operate the creator-focused podcast studio under the Wondery brand. "By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels," Amazon said. Bloomberg News first reported on the Wondery overhaul.

By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Amazon is reorganizing its audio entertainment operations with plans to consolidate some of the production now done across its Wondery and Audible brands. As a result of the changes, Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is exiting her post after four years at the helm of one of the industry’s largest podcast studios. Amazon disclosed the changes with an internal memo from Steve Boom, who is VP of audio, Twitch and games for Amazon. The reorganization will include about 100 layoffs.

Popular on Variety Wondery podcasts that were more narrative-driven such as true crime favorites “Dr. Death” and “Dirty John” will now shift under the Audible brand, which encompasses original audio production as well as a vast audio book library. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. In a statement, Amazon positioned the changes as a streamlining of audio content across the comapny’s vast media footprint. “The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content. These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon,” Amazon said in a statement. “By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: EA Explains Why Fans Aren’t Getting The Sims 5
URL: https://kotaku.com/sims-5-dynasty-warriors-remaster-call-duty-union-switch-2-2000614479
Time Published: 2025-08-04T14:48:55Z
Full Content:
Dynasty WarriorsThe Sims 5Unions Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to The Sims 4? Why is Dynasty Warriors 3 objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at Kotaku experiment with reviving our old Morning Checkpoint roundup series that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first Call of Duty developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go! That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) told Variety when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. “What I wouldn’t want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years,” she said. “We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on The Sims 4, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.” What fans are getting is a Sims movie with help from Barbie‘s Margot Robbie. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on Apex Legends. Quality assurance devs at Call of Duty support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union amid the 2021 workplace fallout, but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at Updater now reports that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao. Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is continuing to blaze through temperature records. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company posted. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5–35°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch back in 2022. Everything is going great, folks. Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the Dynasty Warriors series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary. Dynasty Warriors Origins, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. Dynasty Warriors 3, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games? Over 1 million people claimed the FreedomToBuy bundle from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, the storefront reports. It included Postal 2, Agony, Fetish Locator Week One, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io due to payment processors. The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when Metroid Prime 4 is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada near the end of August. A November release date is feeling more and more likely. Someone on Reddit found a leaked Amazon listing for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating the 40th anniversary of Rare, the studio best known for Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, and Sea of Thieves, among other iconic classics. It’s $90 and looks very nice. There’s also a vinyl soundtrack collection and Evercade cartridges for old Rare games. Don’t miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone." As Rare - known for the likes of Sea of Thieves, Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online. The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via reddit). The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the Amazon listing, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller. "A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life." Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below. Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment. This controller leaked on the same day Rare itself shared an anniversary post on social media, celebrating 40 years in the business. "From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," it wrote, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below). "For keeping an assorted ragtag of creatives working magic in the Midlands, only two words will do: THANK YOU." Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox. Everwild was first revealed in late 2019. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves.

BitMine's rapid $2.9B ETH accumulation positions it third globally in crypto treasuries, capturing investor attention. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, revealed that its total holdings are now at 833,137 ETH valued at over $2.9 billion, according to an Aug. 4 statement. This development places BitMine far ahead of previous frontrunner SharpLink, which reportedly holds 438,000 ETH. With this latest acquisition, BitMine has also climbed to third place globally in overall crypto treasuries, trailing only behind Bitcoin-focused entities Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and BTC miner Marathon Digital Holdings. Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine’s board and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said: “BitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH growing our ETH holdings to over 833,000 from zero 35 days ago. We have separated ourselves among crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high liquidity of our stock.” BitMine’s stock, trading under the ticker BMNR, has seen a sharp increase in market activity. Data from Fundstrat shows that BMNR averaged $1.6 billion in daily trading volume over the past five days, ranking 42nd among all US-listed stocks, just behind ride-hailing giant Uber. Alongside higher trading volumes, BitMine’s stock price has surged more than 300% since it launched its ETH strategy. That rise appears driven by growing institutional interest, with key investors now including Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest and Bill Miller III, a senior advisor at both Miller Value Partners and Patient Capital Management. Miller, who famously backed MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin pivot in 2020, sees a familiar pattern at BitMine. According to him: “What is intriguing is BitMine is set to be very profitable once the Company turns on ETH staking. In my experience, the best management teams make rational decisions based upon evidence, exhibit independent thinking, and allocate capital with an objective of earning returns above the cost of capital.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Storage innovation surges to keep pace with AI shift to inference
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/opinion/Storage-innovation-surges-to-keep-pace-with-AI-shift-to-inference
Time Published: 2025-08-04T11:32:00Z
Full Content:
We provide market insights, research and advisory, and technical validations for tech buyers. In the fast-paced, whack-a-mole world of AI infrastructure, innovation in one area has a habit of creating fresh challenges in another. As AI attention increasingly shifts to the "value" phase -- inference -- a new set of issues is emerging for those running AI workloads at large scale. Notably, these are driving a fascinating new wave of innovation in the storage and data ecosystem that will likely have implications as more regular enterprises get on board with advanced inferencing. It's already clear that the underlying data infrastructure plays a critical role when running AI at scale. Indeed, research from Enterprise Strategy Group, now part of Omdia, found that data management issues are a top-two challenge for organizations deploying AI workloads. But, as the emphasis of AI rapidly shifts to advanced reasoning and agentic inferencing, those challenges are set to grow, potentially significantly. In such advanced inferencing scenarios, there's a ton of focus on the specific challenges associated with growing context windows. Broadly, these windows refer to the amount of tokens an AI model can consider at one time when generating a response or prediction. Context windows are growing in terms of both scale and complexity as users become more proficient with AI reasoning tools and expectations grow. Not only are users asking more sophisticated questions, but they are doing so over extended time periods. Think about how you may have interacted with a generative AI tool and then perhaps returned with a follow-up question several minutes or even hours later. Did you expect the model to remember where you left off? Additionally, prompts can now handle data types beyond text, increasingly supporting content such as PDFs, code and even video. This is leading to an explosion in the number of tokens generated for each prompt. As an example, Llama 1 supported a context window of 2,048 tokens when Meta released it in 2023. By contrast, earlier this year, Meta released Llama 4, which has support for up to 10 million tokens -- a 5,000 times increase. The "10 million tokens" problem may be more of a theoretical limit than an actual problem that is felt today, but there is broad agreement that, regardless of the size of the environment, a wave of tokens is heading toward us. This tsunami will likely overwhelm today's infrastructure, so alternatives are required. The key-value (KV) cache is where the context window is built and stored and, as such, is a critical -- and highly compute-intensive -- step in the reasoning process for large language models (LLMs). It's where the contextual understanding of the input request is built; think of it as the short-term memory of the LLM. The challenges associated with storing hundreds of thousands or even millions of tokens mean that, in more demanding or sophisticated environments, the KV cache quickly fills up. In such a scenario, older data must be evicted to accommodate new requests. To regain context, older prompts must then be repeatedly recalculated. The "GPU tax" comes into play here. Rather than using expensive GPU cycles to create new insights, they must instead spend time recalculating data they have already created. That's an inefficient use of an expensive resource. The KV cache was originally designed to deliver high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is pinned to the local GPU server. Tools such as vLLM have emerged as popular and efficient ways to manage data here. However, HBM is the most expensive form of memory, and as token counts grow, so does the need for a larger KV cache. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to use additional memory resources. The next obvious step in the memory hierarchy is CPU memory -- DRAM. Here, frameworks such as LMCache enable KV cache offloading to local CPU memory. But, as context windows and their associated tokens grow exponentially, this is not necessarily enough either. To cost-effectively meet the performance needs of advanced AI inferencing in the future, GPUs will likely need a KV cache that taps a larger pool of high-performance storage, such as NVMe. This would help context windows to dramatically expand, enabling GPUs to focus more of their time serving new prompts, while simultaneously boosting overall efficiency. Managing KV cache data this way also potentially brings other benefits, managing data on a global, more intelligent basis that can serve a wider variety of purposes. Given the stakes, it's not surprising that multiple industry players are intently focused on addressing this challenge. Overall, the storage for AI space has seen strong development in recent years, as suppliers have worked to overcome a range of AI-related performance challenges. We've seen the emergence of AI-focused storage specialists, each with their own technical approaches based on advanced data management software architectures and utilizing advancements in fast remote direct memory access technologies and protocols. In addition, we're currently seeing a surge of activity around advanced inferencing specifically, including KV cache management. For example, earlier this year, Weka announced a capability it calls Augmented Memory Grid (AMG), which is due for general availability in the fall. This feature uses Weka's parallel file system software to create an external pool of shared NVMe storage, which is attached directly to GPU servers and persists as a high-performance token warehouse. It drives memory-like performance but at NVMe costs, Weka said. AMG can also run in conjunction with Weka's recently announced NeuralMesh Axon software, which implements its software stack entirely in the GPU server to take advantage of underused NVMe flash storage within the server itself. Indeed, Weka said customers will experience far greater value when running the two aspects together. Though the technical implementation differs, Vast Data's Undivided Attention (VUA) feature, also announced earlier this year, offers similar capabilities. It uses Vast's Disaggregated Shared Everything architecture, in the process creating what it terms an "infinite memory space for context data." Like Weka's AMG, VUA is optimized for vLLM frameworks. DDN is joining the party with the new Infinia object storage. It has a KV cache embedded directly within it; DDN recently detailed a test scenario it said delivers the fastest Time to First Token in the industry for advanced reasoning workloads. Notably, Nvidia is also focused on addressing these challenges. Nvidia's play here, announced earlier this year, is Dynamo, a low-latency distributed framework for scaling reasoning AI models. One of the several innovations within Dynamo, which supports existing frameworks such as vLLM, is KV Cache Manager. The feature enables the offloading of older or less frequently accessed KV cache blocks to more cost-effective memory and storage, such as CPU memory, local storage or external networked storage. Nvidia said this approach can support petabytes of KV cache data to be stored at a fraction of the cost of storing it in GPU memory. Exactly how this will play with the various offerings from storage vendors is still to be determined. To some degree, Nvidia is offering an alternative approach here. However, Vast, Weka and others said they are working with Nvidia to offer integration between their capabilities and Dynamo. The new Nvidia Inference Transfer Library (NIXL), a high throughput, low-latency point-to-point communication library, provides a consistent data movement API to move data rapidly and synchronously across different tiers of memory and storage. Optimized specifically for inference data movement, NIXL supports different types of memory, local SSDs and, crucially, networked storage from Nvidia storage partners. Storage vendors are already working to achieve integration with NIXL. Weka has open sourced a dedicated plugin for NIXL. Meanwhile, Vast recently shared details of a test scenario that integrated the Nvidia NIXL GPUDirect Storage (GDS) plugin with the Vast AI OS. The test, Vast said, drove a single H100 GPU at 35 GBps using GDS without saturating the Vast AI OS' available throughput. In other words, storage would not be a bottleneck when offloading LLM KV caches to the Vast platform. It's tempting to view such context window challenges as something that should only concern a small number of large-scale AI builders, hyperscalers, neoclouds/AI service providers, large research institutions and so on. Such an assumption may be dangerous. Although it's true that handling millions of tokens over thousands of GPUs is still the preserve of very few, more mainstream enterprises are starting to get their hands dirty with advanced reasoning and agentic AI. Such deployments may only amount to tens of GPUs, but the prompts will likely be just as sophisticated. So, the need to effectively marshal a large volume of tokens will be just as critical, perhaps even more so, given the resource constraints. Hence, any infrastructure leaders contemplating their organization's inference journey should keep a close eye on developments here. The range of options for customers continues to grow and will likely expand further over the coming months. Mainstream storage providers -- including Dell, such as with Project Lightning; NetApp; and Pure Storage with FlashBlade//EXA -- are all sharpening their AI wares, and AI storage specialists, such as Hammerspace, are increasingly targeting the broader enterprise opportunity. Ultimately, the inference-specific issues detailed here are but one aspect of a much broader set of memory-, storage- and data-related challenges that organizations will face as they scale their AI workloads. The real trick for infrastructure leaders will be to build an AI environment that can elegantly handle these issues alongside the myriad additional challenges they face. In this respect, the ongoing innovations from across the supplier ecosystem augur very well for the future.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) In the world of rock climbing, athletes don't simply grab a new ledge and reach out for the next one. First, they put their full weight on the new ledge to ensure it's solid before aiming higher. Bitcoin BTC$116,603.38 has followed a similar pattern since Friday's U.S. jobs data, which triggered concerns of a recession in the world's largest economy. The cryptocurrency's price came under pressure, dropping almost to $111,965, testing support at the then-record high set in May, over the weekend. It recovered to trade recently around $114,700. The decline resulted in roughly $670 million in losses on perpetual futures positions, of which over $550 million were long positions, according to Coinglass. The crowding out of the excess leverage could mean a more sustainable upswing in prices. John Glover, the chief investment officer at Ledn, said he now expects BTC to rally to around $140,000 by year-end. 10x Research recently identified the $111,965 level as an attractive risk-reward entry point for traders. The price rebound suggests some may have followed that advice to join the bull run. Canary Capital CEO Stephen McClurg argued that bitcoin is rapidly positioning itself as a turbocharged risk asset, aligned with Nasdaq trends, but with greater volatility. He called stablecoins digital cousins of money market funds. On the macro front, the nonfarm payrolls data revealed a sharp slowdown in the labor market, reviving prospects of a Fed interest-rate cut in September. Still, with the expectations being spurred by economic pain, they may not necessarily bode well for risk assets. This week's U.S. CPI and PPI inflation readings will help solidify the outlook. Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at crypto exchange Bitget, said BTC is likely to consolidate around $112,000-$118,000 this week, supported by strong technicals and ether to trade in the $3,300-$3,800 range driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest. "Rising ETH adoption and on-chain activity could fuel outperformance, but bitcoin's dominance may cap significant altcoin gains unless broader market sentiment shifts further toward risk-on behavior," Lee told CoinDesk in an email. Speaking of ether, a whale conducted a large buy-the-dip operation over the weekend, snapping up millions in ETH in a sign of their long-term conviction. In other news, Base now leads Solana in daily token introductions, driven by the rise of Zora's Creator Coins, according to Dune Analytics. Lido, the liquid staking platform, laid off 15% of its workforce. "While it may seem counterintuitive amid a market upswing, the move reflects a deliberate commitment to sustainable growth, operational focus, and alignment with the priorities of LDO tokenholders," Lido DAO's Vasiliy Shapovalov said on X. In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 rose over 0.5% while the dollar index added 0.2%. Morgan Stanley called Friday's dip in stocks a buy-the-dip opportunity. Stay alert!

Title: Why Platforms Like Substack Won't Make Sense for Much Longer
URL: https://danielmiessler.com/blog/future-of-substack
Time Published: 2025-08-04T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I think the future of Substack is self-hosting. Or—more directly—I don't think they have much of a future. You've probably heard about Substack's issues—$585M valuation after failing to raise a Series C in 2022, the 14% staff layoffs, the major creator exodus in early 2024 over content moderation failures, and the fact that prominent writers like Casey Newton's Platformer jumped ship to competitors. Substack is showing all the classic warning signs of a dying platform (see below), but I care more about the fact that people had to go to Substack in the first place, and that they're now unhappy. To me it's part of a larger issue with the platforms in general. I've been blogging since 1999 and I've seen a few dozen of these platforms over the years. I've probably used nearly a dozen myself. I think the reason these platforms fail after a limited run is because they tend to toxify over time. I think, fundamentally, it's just hard to have a giant platform like this where the incentives can stay aligned with its users. So there are two main paths: Here's a not-even-comprehensive list of the platforms and why they're no longer around. Why it failed: Acquired by Twitter, then shut down Twitter acquired for talent, not product. Couldn't compete with Tumblr's growth. Shut down April 30, 2013. Peak: 4.5M monthly users. Why it failed: Lack of revenue, couldn't compete with Twitter Too complex (tried to combine microblogging, file sharing, events). Acquired by Six Apart and immediately shut down Dec 2008. Only had ~100k users at peak. Why it failed: Low engagement, poor features Microsoft auto-created accounts for all 500M Hotmail users but only 30M were active. Migrated to WordPress.com Sept 2010. Why it failed: Financial difficulties Pioneered blogging but couldn't afford servers. Shut down Feb 2014 after data loss. Relaunched 2018 as subscription-only. Why it failed: Legal battle (Hulk Hogan lawsuit) $140M verdict in lawsuit funded by Peter Thiel. Filed bankruptcy, shut down Aug 2016. Relaunched 2021 but minimal traffic. Why it failed: NSFW ban, cultural mismatch with Yahoo/VerizonLost 30% of traffic after Dec 2018 adult content ban. Sold by Yahoo for $1.1B (2013), later sold to Automattic for less than $3M (2019). Why it failed: Failed to gain traction Six Apart's attempt at "neighborhood blogging." Never exceeded 600k users. Shut down Sept 30, 2010. Why it failed: Still alive but stagnant under Google Acquired by Google 2003. Last major update 2020. Lost 90%+ market share to WordPress. Many features deprecated. Why it failed: Sold to Russian company, user exodusSold to SUP Media (Russia) 2007. Servers moved to Russia 2016, triggering privacy concerns and mass exodus. Why it failed: Failed to evolve, lost to Facebook/MySpace Peak: 40M users (2005). Shut down 2013, raised $60k to relaunch as "Xanga 2.0." Now basically dead. Why it struggles: Revenue model conflicts with customer needs Multiple layoffs: 2017 (50 people), 2021 (75), 2023 (unknown). Changed business model 5+ times. Major publications left platform. Why it failed: Failed to grow beyond niche Started as invite-only "elite" network. Opened to public 2014 but too late. No meaningful updates since. Estimated <10k active users. Why it failed: Struggles with mainstream adoptionRaised $5M+ via Kickstarter/revenue. Only ~2.5k paying Ghost(Pro) customers despite being around 10+ years. $200+/month pricing drives users to competitors. Why it failed: Lost creators to self-hosting While WordPress.org powers 43% of the web, WordPress.com has <0.4% market share. Creators graduate to self-hosted after hitting limitations. Why it failed: Creator exodus, content moderation crisisPlatformer, Casey Newton left Jan 2024 over Nazi content. Flat $585M valuation after failed Series C (2022). 14% layoffs June 2022. Top writers leaving to avoid 10% fee. Currently growing (benefiting from competitor issues) Founded by Morning Brew alumni. Raised $33M Series B at $192M valuation (Apr 2024). 100k+ newsletters, grew 10x in 2023. Flat pricing beats Substack's %. These seem to be some of the themes. So there's this massive history of these platforms rising up to consume the users fleeing the previous failure. Only to then fall apart themselves years later. Another way to make this point might be to ask why we needed these platforms in the first place? Why were there so many of these? And why did they do so well for so long? It's because individual writers couldn't do one or more of the following: Well, it's now a whole lot easier to do all three. Creating a website that hosts a blog is fairly trivial for AI today, and it will only become more trivial in the months and years to come. So any would-be writer can simply have AI help build them a blog. And it won't even have to look exactly like all the other pages, which is a problem on a site like Substack, who wants to maintain its own branding above that of the creator. Sending mass emails is still a bit of a dark art, but there are services like Amazon SES that AI could also use to build this infrastructure fairly easily. Not to mention using any of the other third-party services that are designed to help people do this. It just becomes a matter of integration with those tools, which AI is really good at. And finally, the benefit of a platform for getting eyes onto your content I think is diminishing as well. First of all, it's not clear to me that anyone on Substack is just getting tons of traffic by virtue of just being there. Second, I think sites like Google and other AI-powered platforms are going to get extremely good at finding the content jewels of what's publicly available and raising them up to others. Basically, AI-powered content discovery. And I think that will have far more impact at lifting the best content. The bottom line is, we're just going to be able to do these things on our own. The platforms tend to be extremely toxic and highly restrictive, and they don't last long anyway. And the only reason they existed in the first place is because it was hard to do the things that they provided. And now with AI, that is all going away.

Title: Apple sceptics have had to eat their words—at least for the time being

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Did US tariffs help Apple Inc achieve a blowout quarter? That was one theory that emerged as the company disclosed a surprising surge in iPhone sales in the April-June quarter, up 14% compared with the period a year earlier, handily beating estimates. Consumers, it was said, were rushing out to stores in fear that Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ trade levies would drastically increase the cost of an upgrade; [reports had suggested that the price could have gone up by 43%]. It certainly makes some logical sense; though the data shows that the fears of consumers soon subsided. According to Placer.ai, which uses mobile location data to monitor foot traffic, elevated sales in the immediate days after Trump’s address rapidly petered out—visitors to US Apple stores were up just 0.93% for the entire fiscal quarter compared to a year earlier. Meanwhile, visits to Apple’s website from US consumers were down 3%, according to data from Similarweb. Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | India’s smartphone exports get buzzy in the US On a call with investors to discuss the results, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook acknowledged that tariff chatter did create unusual buying patterns in April, mostly around sales in the US of the iPhone and Mac computers. But overall, the boost was limited—Apple said just 1 percentage point of its 10% overall revenue growth came from these “pull forward" sales. If Apple’s analysis proves correct—and some analysts seemed sceptical, repeatedly asking for more details—then that would be good news. It means investors would have to worry less that the better-than-expected sales won’t mean a significant dip for the rest of this year. That’s not to say tariffs won’t be a drag— Cook said the company would take a $1.1 billion tariff-related hit in the current quarter, up from $900 million in the last. To emphasize the gusto of his most important product, Cook noted that somebody out there has the 3 billionth iPhone. That’s a staying power that will count for a lot as the company moves to this next era of uncertainty. Also Read: China plus one: Apple and India might need to woo not just Trump but Xi too The quarterly iPhone sales indicate that consumers don’t yet care that the bulk of the device’s artificial-intelligence (AI) features have yet to materialize—they’ll stick with Apple anyway. I found myself agreeing with Cook when he said he felt AI-specific devices—such as glasses from Meta Platforms Inc or whatever it is OpenAI and Jony Ive create—are “likely to be complementary devices, not substitution" for the smartphone. Still, AI is on the mind of investors, and the blockbuster quarter was not enough to distract from that; [notably, Apple’s stock has fallen by double digits since the beginning of the year]. The company reiterated its intent to increase spending to fund its AI efforts and to reallocate talent to speed things up. Cook didn’t, however, address the fact that some of his top AI talent has reallocated itself to Meta. The Apple boss’s apparent lack of interest in joining Big tech’s unprecedented talent war —one that would have made his predecessor, Steve Jobs, sick to his stomach—is one facet in Apple’s obvious unwillingness to follow its peers and bet the entire house on AI. Its capital expenditure, while growing, is expected to be tens of billions of dollars lower than that of other tech giants. The years to come will tell whether Apple was wise to separate itself from the pack. Also Read: Apple intelligence: It’s time to step up and speak out Tellingly, when asked last week whether Cook felt AI innovations like large language models might become commoditized, the CEO declined to answer. “That gives away some things on our strategy," he said. That could be read as a sign Apple doesn’t feel it needs to directly compete in building AI. I think this speaks of a confidence that the iPhone will still be the de facto device of choice for AI whether or not Apple is successful in making a competent ChatGPT of its own. Another interpretation is that Cook doesn’t want to show his hand in any merger and acquisition negotiations, but I guess we’ll see. Cook said on the call that he was “very open" to dealmaking—we’ll see what exactly he feels he needs to buy rather than build. Frankly, you didn’t need to see Apple’s numbers to know it had been a great quarter for the company—you could just listen to the tone of Cook’s voice. Noticeably upbeat as he ran through his remarks, the tenor of the call was in stark contrast from last quarter, when some (myself included) wondered whether the weight of Apple’s numerous challenges were starting to deplete the 64-year-old’s energy reserves. Talk of succession will surely quieten down for the foreseeable future: It’s time to let Tim cook. ©Bloomberg The author is Bloomberg Opinion’s US technology columnist.

Title: IDCC Hits Record Highs: Overheated Or Undervalued?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/04/idcc-hits-record-highs-overheated-or-undervalued/
Time Published: 2025-08-04T09:30:00Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. InterDigital (NASDAQ: IDCC) has increased by 16% over the last five trading days, achieving record highs close to $258 per share (as of July 31), fueled by a significant $1.05 billion arbitration victory against Samsung. However, the pressing question for investors is whether this surge is still sustainable or if the stock has exceeded its fundamental values. At first glance, IDCC’s valuation appears stretched. It has a price-to-sales ratio of 7.8x and a price-to-free-cash-flow multiple of 52.4x, significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. Moreover, its trailing P/E of approximately 20x exceeds its 3-year historical range of 14x. However, context is essential. These high multiples indicate a company that is quickly scaling revenues, increasing margins, and demonstrating the reliability of its licensing model. Thus, although the valuation is high, it is not unreasonable. Strong execution, premium margins, and financial flexibility warrant a higher multiple. Still, after such a significant increase, a short-term correction would not be surprising. That being said, for those looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see META Stock to $1,500? InterDigital’s strength is anchored in its asset-light, high-margin licensing model, which is supported by upstream R&D in 4G/5G/6G, video compression, and AI. It possesses a strong patent portfolio—many of which are standards-essential—licensed to major companies such as Samsung, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Xiaomi. With a net margin of 48.1% and an operating cash flow margin of 24.6%, IDCC stands out as one of the most profitable entities in its sector. The ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce in favor of Samsung added $131 million in annual recurring revenue—a 67% increase over the previous agreement—plus a $119 million catch-up payment for Q2. This significantly reduces the risk of near-term revenue fluctuations and reinforces InterDigital’s intellectual property strength in mobile, video, and AI standards. While Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM)experienced an 8% decline during the same week, IDCC rose as investors anticipated future cash flows and improved visibility. The Q2 2025 results showcased the company’s momentum. Revenue skyrocketed 34% year-over-year to $300.6 million, significantly exceeding expectations. Non-GAAP EPS was reported at $6.52—almost double the estimates—while GAAP net income saw a 65% increase to $180.6 million. Smartphone licensing revenue rose 18% to $235 million, and licensing revenue from Consumer Electronics/Internet of Things/Automotive surged 175% to $65 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 79% year-over-year. With an upgraded full-year revenue forecast of $790–850 million, along with $41.7 million returned to shareholders in Q2, InterDigital is effectively leveraging its scale and influence. InterDigital has exhibited remarkable growth, with revenues increasing at an average rate of 22.9% over the past three years—significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. In the last 12 months alone, revenue jumped 33.5%, compared to just 4.4% for the broader market. InterDigital boasts a 57.3% operating margin (versus 18.3% for the S&P 500), a net margin of 48.1% (compared to 11.8%), and a 24.6% operating cash flow margin (versus 19.8%). These outstanding metrics arise from its lean, asset-light model, where upfront R&D results in high-margin, recurring licensing income. Financially, the company is on stable ground, with a 7.7% debt-to-equity ratio and 47.4% cash-to-assets, both significantly better than S&P 500 averages. With $948 million in cash and $472 million in debt, InterDigital is strategically positioned to invest, absorb shocks, or expand without financial pressure. Although InterDigital has historically underperformed the S&P 500 during significant market declines, it has consistently shown faster recovery. During the 2022 inflation crisis, the stock dropped 52.5% but fully recovered within a year. During the 2020 COVID market crash, it fell 46.9% and bounced back in under six months. Even during the Global Financial Crisis, when shares fell by 53.5%, InterDigital regained its footing in roughly 2.5 years. While the stock is certainly volatile, its track record suggests strong long-term resilience. IDCC meets numerous criteria: substantial upside through IP licensing, best-in-class margins, and improved visibility due to recurring revenue. Although it may not yet be a multi-billion-dollar entity, it presents asymmetric upside with defensible growth drivers. Not too pleased with the volatile nature of IDCC stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. What’s the explanation? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

A federal judge in Texas largely denied a request by the world’s largest asset managers to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general claiming they colluded to reduce coal output, in a case that threatens how the U.S. firms oversee trillions of dollars. U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Texas said most of the claims brought by the states can proceed, including allegations that BlackRock Inc., BlackRock Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. collectively used their stock to attempt to substantially lessen competition. Kernodle dismissed part of the lawsuit that was based on alleged violations of state law. In his Friday ruling, Kernodle said the states “have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.” Representatives for the firms didn’t immediately return requests for comment on the ruling. In their lawsuit, Texas and other Republican-led states claimed the asset managers colluded to pressure coal producers to reduce their production under the guise of pursuing environmental goals. The states cite the firms’ participation in carbon-reduction alliances as evidence of a “syndicate.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard hold major stakes in coal producers and profited when energy prices soared, according to the suit. More recently, the firms have pulled back from ESG in the U.S. and participation in groups such as Climate Action 100+ and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Texas even removed BlackRock from its blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels. But the lawsuit, filed in November, said that formal withdrawal from Climate 100+ “does not change the reality that defendants’ holdings threaten to substantially reduce competition in violation” of U.S. antitrust law. Lawyers for the three firms argued at a hearing in June that the firms did nothing to influence coal companies. “The antitrust claims in this case are unprecedented, they’re unsound and they’re unsupported,” said Gregg Costa, a lawyer representing BlackRock. “The claims just don’t add up.” Topics Lawsuits Texas Legislation

UPDATED 16:13 EDT / AUGUST 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and George Gilbert Last November, we argued that JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of unique data that will never find its way into proprietary large language models via the internet. And as such, he was OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (“Messiah AGI”) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI” — meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable economic endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. In our previous “Jamie Dimon” episode, we set a framework for the why. In this Breaking Analysis, we explain how enterprises such as JPMC will drive value in a way that frontier model vendors cannot. We’ll examine our original premise and share data that further reinforces the challenges foundation model vendors face, making it a daunting business. Moreover, we’ll explain why agents, programmed by data, will ultimately provide the biggest value unlock for enterprises in the coming years. We think of agent evolution in three distinct waves as shown below: Consumer agents – ChatGPT in its GPT-3/4 era gave us the first taste of a personal digital assistant. GPT-5 will likely deliver the first general-purpose, consumer-grade agent that can act on a user’s behalf, not just chat. Coding agents – Anthropic’s Claude paired with Cursor shows what happens when you post-train with reinforcement learning onto a strong base model and aim it at software engineering. Code is a good proving ground because outcomes are objectively testable, much like math problems. Enterprise agents – We believe this is the next frontier – i.e. agents powered by a live digital twin of the business. Not digital twins of something physical such as a factory like Nvidia Corp.’s Omniverse, rather an enterprise. Here the landscape changes. It’s not just about bigger models; it’s new vendor tech stacks, new vendor business models, and new customer operating models that we’ll explain. The value is so large that even Jamie Dimon, with his huge balance sheet and orders of magnitude more useful data than frontier labs have access to, is stepping onto Sam Altman’s playing field. With that framing in place, let’s walk through why the jump from consumer/coder agents to enterprise agents is not a linear extrapolation, and what new technology and organizational layers have to materialize before Jamie Dimon can realistically challenge OpenAI’s lead. We make the following additional points on this topic: Dimon, as we’ve talked about before, is a proxy for enterprises and the proprietary data and know-how that they have within their four walls that frontier LLMs cannot train on. This is why the real value will come from enterprises applying that data and know-how to extending the frontier LLMs or models that are similar to that and we’ll explain why. The real revolution is that we’ve moved from scaling laws in the pre-training era—which is the GPT models that ChatGPT and similar products were built on, to the post-training era, which is where we start using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a fancy term for trial-and-error learning and, for trial-and-error, you have to be able to learn from your mistakes. So that’s where agents in the enterprise first take off. And then our contention is that to go beyond that is where we’re going to need a new type of technology platform — the enterprise digital twin. To get real value out of that, we’re going to have to go with a new—not just new technology model at the foundation where the data is — but a new operations model where firms have to organize around end-to-end outcomes like onboarding a new customer, not departmental or functional specialization. As such, we’re going to need lots of changes. And the main point is that Jamie Dimon (as a proxy for leading enterprises) and the value he’s going to extract from this era of AI is going to need completely different scaffolding and sets of business models for customers like him, as well as the vendors that supply him, compared to the era where ChatGPT is creating and capturing value today. In short, we believe this shift — from pre-training scale to post-training skill, and from siloed workflows to outcome-centric twins — sets the competitive chessboard for the next decade of enterprise AI. Let’s drill into the first wave a bit deeper ChatGPT on GPT3.5 got it all started. but GPT-5 is where we think ChatGPT’s real value as a general-purpose consumer agent begins. OpenAI’s own revenue projection (dotted red line below) climbs from low-single billions in 2024 to >$50 billion by 2027 — a growth curve that many people feel threatens Google Search – we’ll see. The red call-outs above are instructive as there are caveats, technical rewirings and business model changes that have to fall into place before GPT-5-class agents can move from cool demo to must-have personal assistant. Specifically: Thirty years ago investors hailed the commercial internet as the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. Today we hear equally grand pronouncements that generative AI surpasses fire, the wheel and electricity. GPT-5 will likely justify a good share of that hyperbole. By unifying multimodal reasoning — voice, video, tool use, research, code execution — OpenAI is poised to ship the first truly full-stack consumer agent, a blockbuster product by any historical yardstick. But the leap from headline to habit requires upheaval on multiple fronts: The headline is that GPT-5 can ignite massive consumer adoption, yet widespread value capture hinges on re-plumbing the web and re-monetizing content. That’s before we even tackle the additional hurdles unique to enterprise deployment, which carry their own technology, governance and operating-model demands. Before we get too excited about GPT-5, let’s stare at the brutal economics of scale. The data below tells a big story. Upper-right chart: That “scaling-law” line (log of compute petaflops for pretraining on the X-axis, log of test-loss, which is a fancy way of describing accuracy and the ability to recognize ever finer patterns, on the Y-axis) moves steadily down — but every inch of improvement demands an order-of-magnitude jump in PF-days (petaflop-days) of compute. Let’s unpack where the above numbers come from. On the slide above, the left axis shows estimated training cost per generation; the right axis plots the corresponding test-loss improvement. The $35 million mark for a GPT-3-class model is the common reference point. Each successive generation requires roughly a 10-times to to 30-times increase in training FLOPs, but after algorithmic and hardware efficiencies the all-in cash outlay still grows about five to 10 times each cycle. Numbers often look smaller because they capture only the final two- or three-month production run. That explains the confusion around DeepSeek’s reported $6 million cost; the figure omitted the research runs, data-ablation experiments and restarts that consume three to 10 times more compute before the last pass even begins. The slide’s curve makes a second point clear. Each jump in spend buys only an incremental drop in test loss — better predictive accuracy, more reliable answers, finer pattern detection. Keeping pace on pretraining alone is already pushing costs toward $10 billion for a single next-gen run. At that level the market cannot sustain many players unless they add a strongly differentiated layer on top of the base model. Coming bottlenecks in high-quality training data and intense competition will squeeze both the magnitude and the lifespan of any price premium on raw application programming interface access. Reinforcement-learning can address the law of diminishing returns by opening up a new scaling vector. And inference-time “reasoning” opens up yet another dimension of scaling. But the pretraining foundation still needs to keep advancing. This means the capital intensity of playing at the frontier model layer continues to increase exponentially. The economics of amortizing pretraining works as long as the end market continues to grow at a similar pace. But when the market growth slows, the cost of pretraining is going to look like a game of musical chairs when the music stops. So far we’ve focused on compute costs, but there’s an equally brutal constraint we need to discuss, which is that we’re running out of free, high-quality human text. The chart above tracks the “effective stock” of usable internet tokens (green band) versus the projected size of datasets consumed by frontier models (blue band). Those two curves meet around 2027-28 — meaning every extra point of model improvement will require new strategies. We should point out though that synthetic data is easy to generate with computer code because you can test it and therefore, the synthetic data now has more signal in it. Does it work? Does it not work? And you have all sorts of tests and that’s why as we’ll see, coding agents take off first. But the first way of trying to get past this data wall as we’re going to show is to use human-generated reasoning traces, which is when you get essentially a wide range of experts in different fields to try and elaborate on their problem-solving strategies to get to a solution for how to solve problems in specific domains, and that’s super expensive. As such: Model vendors will see their cost of goods sold for training data rise significantly. Depending on the posture of public policy, they may have to pay to license proprietary publisher data. Those deals are already starting as we saw with the recent Amazon/NYT deal. Whether this is the first of many or a high-water mark remains to be seen. More important, model vendors will have to source ever more sophisticated problem sets and “reasoning traces” from human experts in ever more fields. That’s what data vendors such as Scale.ai specialize in sourcing. Alex Wang of Scale AI says the next breakthroughs hinge on human-annotated chains of thought — not just more scraped text prose. Annotation at that depth is expensive and slow. It’s the next bottleneck. That type of data scarcity reshapes the economics of pretraining frontier models. And it’s why Meta reportedly shelled out ~$15 billion for a 50% stake in Scale.ai’s network of experts. [Listen to Alex Wang explain this phenomenon] A key point made by Wang is: “Data production will be the lifeblood of future AI systems” and he emphasized the human element – and this is why Meta paid $15 billion to acquire Alex. Some additional context to Alex Wang’s comments: Data production is very similar to spice production; it will be the lifeblood of future AI systems. The best-and-brightest people are one key source of that lifeblood, but proprietary data is just as critical. JPMorgan alone holds hundreds of petabytes of data, while GPT-4 trained on less than one petabyte. Enterprises and governments own orders of magnitude more proprietary data than has ever been fed into a frontier model, and that reservoir can power the next wave of truly elite systems. The open question is the role of synthetic data. The most plausible path is hybrid human-AI generation: AI handles the bulk creation, while domain experts — people with deep reasoning skills — inject high-fidelity corrections and insights. Hybrid human-AI data is the only way to achieve the extreme quality and nuance that future models will require. Meta’s reported $15 billion deal for Scale AI underscores this reality. The acquisition was less about tooling and more about access to Alex Wang, a small cadre of specialists, and Scale’s network of expert labelers across multiple domains. Human expert reasoning traces have emerged as the new bottleneck for frontier labs. In effect, these firms are calling for patriotic data contributions so everyone else can benefit, because without those human-validated traces, large language models will stall at their current ceiling. The funny part of Alex Wang’s comment was that he was basically calling on experts in every field to “contribute” their expertise for the benefit of mankind. Scale pays these experts for their time, but it’s still hourly wage labor. The tongue-in-cheek headline, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,” was at the heart of Karl Marx’s economic philosophy. If you squint hard enough, that sounds an awful lot like what Alex Wang is proposing: Subject-matter experts contribute their knowledge for model training for the benefit of mankind. After the $15 billion acquihire, Alex Wang could be history’s richest communist. In the enterprise, there’s a very concrete use case that is already taking off and gives every indication of supporting frontier model training on its own. Why is coding is such a popular use case? And why are software engineering agents the first killer application in the enterprise? Let’s dig in. The face at the top on the graphic below is Anthropic PBC CEO Dario Amodei, whose Claude model powers Cursor the product — the software engineering agent. And Cursor is just the leading example of many software engineering agents. We’re still on the same intelligence-over-time curve, after the ChatGPT consumer bump, we see a new step-function labeled “Claude + Cursor SWE Agents.” The revenue table on the left — $1 million at launch, $100 million by month 12, $300 million by month 24, $500 million by month 30 — illustrates just how fast the uptake has been. What makes coding uniquely suited for early enterprise-agent success, and what hurdles remain before we can generalize this model to finance, supply-chain or customer-service domains where the feedback signals aren’t as clear? The answer is provided in the commentary below: Trial-and-error learning – reinforcement learning in formal terms – explains the breakout success of software-engineering agents. Unlike foundation models that consume 15 trillion tokens of data, a coding agent generates its own data. It proposes a solution, runs a test and immediately learns from pass-or-fail feedback. This loop supplies endless synthetic data and intrinsic reward signals, eliminating the need for vast proprietary datasets. Just as important, the workflow drops neatly into established developer tooling, so adoption requires no organizational surgery. These conditions made software engineering the natural beachhead for AI agents. Cursor is the iconic reference point, but dozens of similar tools are scaling fast, nearly all gravitating to Anthropic’s Claude frontier model as the preferred engine. Most products focus on writing net-new code or translating between languages; wholesale refactoring of legacy codebases is a harder problem and remains largely untapped. Success in software and math does not automatically port to other enterprise domains, where equivalent, high-fidelity feedback loops are harder to construct – a challenge we explore in subsequent slides. Let’s dig deeper into why SWE and math are such good examples. The chart below tracks accuracy on a basket of “intelligence” benchmarks – grade-school math, competitive math, software engineering task suite, multi-subject exams — over the past five years. Y-axis is benchmark accuracy; X-axis is calendar year. Everything meanders upward until sometime in 2024, then the red box shows a near-vertical surge. What changed? Post-training reinforcement learning on top of an already-strong base model. During the pretraining era – essentially up through mid-2024 – data efficiency was modest, reliant on scraping the vast but finite reservoirs of freely available Internet text. Once those wells began to run dry, progress hit diminishing returns. The inflection arrived in late 2024, when the post-training era took hold. Trial-and-error learning, i.e., reinforcement learning, allowed models to generate candidate outputs, verify them autonomously, and update weights based on right-or-wrong signals. Benchmarks in math and coding responded almost immediately, climbing at a near-vertical rate. The mechanism is straightforward: An agent checks its own work; if the test passes, the gradient reinforces that solution. If it fails, the model adjusts. That loop delivers dramatic gains without requiring trillions of new tokens. Both domains offer an immediate, unambiguous reward signal – code compiles or it doesn’t or it passes a unit test or it doesn’t; the math is either right or wrong – so the agent can as an objective verification tool, retry and learn. That tight loop means you don’t need another 10 trillion tokens of pretraining data; you just need a verifiable reward. But the catch is called out on the right of the graphic. The recipe doesn’t yet generalize to, say, legal reasoning or financial forecasting, where the ground truth is fuzzy, delayed or buried in human judgment. Generalizing the technique remains an open challenge. Two paths are emerging: The critical takeaway is once a domain provides an automated verifier, post-training efficiency explodes. The race is now to identify or construct verifiable environments beyond software and mathematics. There may be a new way of generating synthetic data that gets us past both the data bottleneck and the challenge of objectively verifiable rewards – something that appeared not long after Wang cashed his check. It has to do with trial-and-error learning (the fancy term is reinforcement learning) and models that can verify subjective, not objective, answers without humans in the loop. In other words, we may have a way of getting past human expert annotators detailing their reasoning to get to a correct answer. It appears GPT5, or an upgrade that comes soon after, will try to generate some combination of expert questions, answers, and the reasoning traces to get to the answers. Another model, acting like a teacher or verifier, will grade the right answers and the reasoning traces. This way the models might be able to get on a steep learning curve for more subjective answers just the way they’ve been learning math and coding. With verifiable rewards, SWE agents have been improving much faster than the general purpose underlying models. Once you inject reinforcement learning into a reliable reward signal, progress goes exponential. On the chart below, the Y-axis plots “task length” (think: wall-clock work a human would need). The gentle green slope (seven-month cadence) is overshadowed by the blue trend line on the right – halving the time horizon every 70 days. Left chart (METR data). Across general agent benchmarks the length of tasks an AI can complete without human hand-holding doubles roughly every seven months. GPT-2 could answer a trivia question; GPT-4o can spend ~15 minutes autonomously optimizing code for a custom chip. The slide isolates the core issue in agent self-improvement. For broad, loosely verified tasks the only boost comes from generic gains in the base model and occasional evaluation cycles – yielding a doubling of autonomous task-length roughly every seven months. In contrast, software-development agents operate with a hard reward signal: They either pass the unit test or they don’t. That verifiable feedback drives reinforcement learning that doubles task complexity every 70 days. The metric here is simple, how long the agent can run without human intervention. The sharper slope proves that hard, binary reward signals accelerate learning by an order of magnitude. That is the essential takeaway. Before crowning one model king, let’s look at the brutal economics of the models beneath the rise of agentic AI products. In the chart below, the Y-axis is the composite benchmark score; each colored step represents a new model release. The dark line highlights OpenAI’s leading model, which itself changes (with each square dot), and the quick catch-up by rivals (the other colored lines). The staircase chart plots an independent “AI-intelligence index” for frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and others over the past 24 months. What stands out is how small both dimensions have become. GPT-4o takes the lead but within weeks DeepSeek R1 or Gemini 3 closes the gap. Switching costs between APIs are measured in a few lines of Python code, so the CAP shortens with every release. In other words, you can spend a billion dollars on compute and data only to enjoy a six-week pricing umbrella before the market reduces your advantage to zero. The point is, spending $10 billion and multiple years on a frontier training run no longer guarantees a lasting edge. The moment a new model lands, the competitive lead can evaporate almost as quickly as a new consumer gadget cycle. Unlike the pharmaceutical industry – where patent protection secures a decade of exclusivity – model training enjoys no comparable moat. The current race revolves around ever‐larger compute clusters and incremental algorithmic tweaks. Hardware scale is available to any firm with sufficient capital; algorithmic insights diffuse quickly through open research and employee mobility. Proprietary training data helps, but it is only one ingredient and rarely decisive. To achieve both a substantial competitive-advantage gap and a durable competitive-advantage period, the game must shift. The next era will require an entirely different data foundation, one capable of conferring a sustained, defensible edge. That foundation is the enterprise digital twin discussed in the sections that follow. To tease the last section, Jamie Dimon and any other enterprise that can model their data into a digital twin of operations, can train proprietary agents that have a very high CAG and a durable CAP. All the capex may be going into a half-dozen or more frontier labs, but the sustainable differentiation will lie in these enterprises. Let’s now explore how this dynamic shows up in pricing models for the underlying frontier models. The chart below lays this out. Here’s the killer behind those shrinking advantage windows: token prices are in free-fall. Y-axis is log-scale price per million tokens (from $100 down to sub-penny). X-axis spans October 2021 to April 2025. Each diagonal line shows successive model releases driving price down an order of magnitude every few months. So USD per million tokens against release dates. Every colored trend-line is a different capability tier -GPT-3.5-class (teal), GPT-4-class (pink), GPT-4o-plus (blue). Regardless of tier, prices are declining on an exponential glide-path: In other words, you can burn $10 billion on GPT-6 training and watch the market re-price that output at a fraction of the margin in a single quarter. Throw in minimal switching costs for customers of the API and you get the picture. The point is that packaged agents — bundled with proprietary data and workflow context — are where we think the durable economics will live. The accelerating collapse in API pricing stands apart from the economics of products built on top. Venture capital is pouring into frontier labs at an unprecedented rate. Nation-state funds are underwriting domestic model efforts, Chinese labs are proliferating and high-profile entrants – Elon Musk among them – are scrambling to join the race. The parallel to the late-’90s internet bubble is hard to ignore – tens of billions chasing what increasingly looks like a mirage. Today the consumer-agent crown already sits with the incumbent leader, and the leading API position belongs to Anthropic. Durable differentiation will not come from another round of capital-intensive model training; it will come from doing something genuinely different. That necessity ushers in the next era, where the advantage shifts to differentiated data foundations and domain-specific agent platforms. Let’s come back to our three eras of AI. We’ve come full circle: Consumer chatbots got us started, coding agents proved to be a flywheel, but enterprise agents are where the real money — and long-term moat — will be built in our view. Think of the trajectory in three discrete eras, mapped on the curve you’ve seen all episode: The core takeaway is AI is programmed by data, and true durable differentiation will come from proprietary data. Consider JPMorgan Chase as a stand-in for any advanced enterprise. Initial estimates pegged its private corpus at roughly 150 petabytes – already hundreds of times the half-petabyte to 1-petabyte used to train a GPT-4-class model. More recent figures suggest the bank may hold on the order of an exabyte. Yet volume alone isn’t the story; it’s how that data is modeled to represent day-to-day operations. Enterprise data is dense, high-signal and – if properly organized – far richer than the broad, low-signal crawl that feeds frontier models. Unlocking that value demands several shifts: These elements will trigger new go-to-market motions, a fresh generation of application-platform vendors, revamped technical stacks, and — ultimately — organizational and business-model change for the enterprises that adopt them. Let’s dig into what enterprise AGI will actually look like. Below is a classic diagram many use to describe the elements of agentic AI – but key pieces are missing to power the enterprise in our view. Most agent diagrams look identical – tools on the left – calendar, calculator, code interpreter, search; cognitive modules on the right – planning, reflection, self-critique, chain-of-thought, sub-goal decomposition; a memory stack across the top; and an action port along the bottom. The entire picture is algorithm-centric because that is what computer-science researchers reward. Data hardly shows up, yet in the enterprise data is everything. This particular diagram – borrowed from a recent Stanford Computer Science lecture – omits the component that actually creates value – the environment or world model. An agent learns only by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback on the outcome. In academic settings that omission is an afterthought; in a business context it is the difference between a toy and a system that can move revenue, cost, or risk. The absence of a first-class data layer in mainstream agent thinking underscores why enterprise agents remain an under-explored frontier. The disruption is staring the industry in the face, but few acknowledge it because the conversation is dominated by algorithmic heroes rather than data realism. Let’s pull some examples from real-world models where agents got started. Before we take too many liberties with the phrase enterprise digital twin, it helps to remember the very first twins that ever mattered to AI researchers were seen in gaming. DeepMind’s AlphaStar learned to dominate StarCraft II not just because its model architecture was magic , but because the entire game environment – the 4-D map of units, resources, timing and fog-of-war – was exposed as a perfect, real-time, real-world model. On the graph below we show the match-making-rating or MMR percentile on the X-axis, skill level on the Y-axis. The blue curve is human progression from silver to grandmaster; the red dot is AlphaStar smashing through the top percentile – discovering strategies no human had ever tried, courtesy of reinforcement learning a digital twin. The crucial insight is the mapping of people, places, things and activities inside a game world to the same four dimensions — people, places, things and processes—inside a business. Conventional data platforms provide static snapshots, a kaleidoscope view. Agents require a richer, dynamic representation that captures how actions ripple across the enterprise. When an agent modifies a step in a process it needs the map to trace the impact on downstream people and workflows. Reinforcement learning flourished first inside environments that already contained such world models. DeepMind’s AlphaStar for StarCraft and OpenAI’s work on the Dota strategy game are canonical examples. Each environment supplied continuous, verifiable rewards – intermediate signals that tested strategic choices and an ultimate win-or-lose outcome. These conditions allowed agents to iterate rapidly and improve. The same principles apply to the enterprise. By constructing a four-dimensional digital twin – people, places, things, processes – businesses can deliver the feedback loops agents need to learn, adapt and ultimately drive measurable results across complex operations. Lessons from AlphaStar and Dota form the blueprint for this more advanced, enterprise-grade implementation. If an agent can exploit a synthetic world model to beat 99% of pro gamers, imagine what it can do when the “map” is a digital twin of a bank or a live model of a supply-chain. But that also means enterprises – not vendors – must own and curate the world model so the agent can learn with verifiable rewards. The point is that the lessons from AlphaStar will translate to finance, healthcare and manufacturing, anything with a digital twin. Minecraft serves as the next reference world model. In the Voyager project the environment is more open-ended than StarCraft. An agent starts by learning how to craft simple stone tools, then uses those tools to build basic structures. As competence grows it discovers how to forge more advanced implements, each new capability unlocking a broader range of tasks. Over time the agent accumulates skills and expands the set of tools at its disposal. That progressive, self-directed skill acquisition is critical because every new ability enriches the environment and, in turn, furnishes richer feedback for further learning. The pattern – learn a tool, use it to create value, learn the next tool – provides an important template for constructing an enterprise world model where agents continuously extend their own action space. Now let’s really try to double down on the importance of data. Every headline about AI credits the algorithm – AlexNet, Transformers, RLHF, the new reasoning stacks – but the right side of this slide reminds us that each breakthrough was really sparked by a new dataset era. A recent blog post by Jack Morrison, highlighted on the Latent Space podcast, underscores a recurring blind spot: Everyone fixates on algorithmic breakthroughs while ignoring the dataset hiding in plain sight. Morrison sketches the reasoning era and notes that agents will learn from verifiers — calculators for math, compilers and unit tests for code — yet leaves the critical dataset box essentially blank. The dataset is obvious. Every organization is building, or will build, a platform that captures an ever-larger digital twin of its operations. That twin — people, places, things, processes — is the immense, high-fidelity corpus that will power enterprise-grade reasoning. Let’s now connect enterprise agents with digital twins as we’re defining them. We’ve moved up the curve from consumer chat to coding / SWE agents – and the slide below shows how it all works inside a company. The chart from Palantir highlights at the bottom right an end-to end supply-chain twin; red call-outs on the left highlight RL feedback arrows feeding the agent box. The metric tree illustrates how “What happened?” rolls up to “What should we do?” Think of three layers working in concert: Installing a digital twin – like the Palantir schematic shown here – is only the first step. The engine that turns that representation into agent learning is the metric tree. Unlike conventional business intelligence dashboards, where key performance indicators live in isolated tables or hand-coded formulas, a metric tree links every measure in a learned, hierarchical graph. Change a node – say, authorizing a product return – and the tree reveals ripples across customer-support satisfaction, on-hand inventory and cash-flow metrics. The richer the twin, the higher the fidelity of those relationships. The agent sits above this structure and dynamically selects tools that correspond to analytical intent: If the tree lacks a metric, the agent adds one – mirroring how Voyager in “Minecraft” learned new tools and skills, then fed them back into the environment. Each new metric becomes a tool; each successful action becomes a skill; both flow into the twin, iteratively expanding its scope. The result is a self-reinforcing feedback loop: Agent actions enrich the symbolic model, and the enriched model, in turn, sharpens agent decisions. The twin need not be perfect on day one; it grows in lock-step with agent capability. Let’s look at how this will affect enterprise architecture. This graphic below builds on our previous work and pulls it all together. It also answers the question: Who is actually building a live, digital representation of the business? The graphic reprises the layered stack often used in Breaking Analysis and Services-as-Software. This pattern echoes the history of information technology: Each new abstraction layer envelops the one below. Lower layers keep innovating, but lose feature-based differentiation and pricing power once the upper layer decides which capabilities to expose. Traditional data platforms captured snapshots of strings; metric-centric platforms upgraded those to snapshots of things. The green layer goes further – capturing processes – bridging sixty years of application and data islands. A quick tour of the contenders: Margin and control will accrue to the layer that captures processes and feeds agents; data infrastructure, while indispensable, becomes the cost-optimized foundation beneath it. Let’s focus now on how enterprise software is splitting into two worlds. Picture the frozen-lake scene from the recent Bond film: Rami Malek’s villain stands unharmed on the glossy surface while a diver flails in the frigid water below. The metaphor captures how enterprise software is cleaving into two distinct worlds. The industry is aligning accordingly: players above the ice focus on modeled business context and higher-margin economics, while those below face mounting pressure to commoditize. The strategic choice is to move up into outcome-driven layers or prepare for tightening margins in the infrastructure trench. The discussion comes back to a single conclusion: Ownership of coherent, high-signal enterprise data is the deciding factor in the next wave of AI value capture. Labs may still dominate headline model releases, yet those models increasingly rely on proprietary ground-truth data that only large organizations possess in scale. On the visual above, Sam Altman anchors the left – world-famous foundation models. Amodei sits center-left, demonstrating that post-training on domain feedback can spin meaningful ARR. Center-right stands the prize everyone is pursuing. In our view, a live, verifiable digital twin of an enterprise is represented at the far right by Dimon, steward of the deepest transaction ledger in banking, perfectly positioned to weaponize that twin and challenge model labs on both margin and moat.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale TL;DR: Figma’s $1.2 billion IPO at a $19.3 billion valuation that soared to $47.1 billion on day one represents one of the most successful tech IPOs in years, outperforming most major offerings since 2020 in terms of both fundamentals and market reception. Figma stands out even among recent high-growth software IPOs like Circle and CoreWeave, with year-over-year revenue growth approaching 50% and Q1 profitability. While 2020’s mega IPOs raised more capital in absolute terms, Figma’s combination of scale, profitability, and explosive first-day performance makes it the gold standard for how B2B companies should approach public markets in 2025. The Fundamentals: – $749 million revenue in 2024 (48% YoY growth), $1B ARR today – 91% gross margin with rolling 12-month revenue of $821 million – Q1 2025 net income of $44.9 million – profitability at scale – Over 13 million monthly users, with only one-third being designers – Around 450,000 customers as of March 31 The IPO Performance: – Priced at $33 per share (above initial $25-$28 range) – Opened at $85, hit intraday high of $124.63, closed first day at $115.50 – 250% first-day pop from offer price – Market cap jumped from $19.3 billion to $47.1 billion Snowflake (September 2020): – Raised $3.9 billion, largest software IPO ever at the time – Valued at $33 billion pre-trading, more than doubled on first day – Narrowly outperformed Nasdaq since initial pop Airbnb (December 2020): – Raised $3.4 billion at $47.3 billion valuation – 112% first-day jump – Up less than 3% since first day as of reporting DoorDash (December 2020): – Priced at $102, first trade at $182, 85% first-day gain – Investors who bought after initial pop lost money The Key Difference: All four 2020 mega IPOs (including Uber/Lyft from 2019) relied on vast amounts of outside capital to grow networks and only Airbnb recorded net profit in latest quarter after massive cost cuts. Figma achieved profitability while growing 48% YoY – a fundamentally different trajectory. CoreWeave (March 2025): – Priced below expectations at $40 per share ($20 billion valuation) – Up 270% since IPO – $981.6 million revenue (420% growth) but $314.6 million net loss – 77% of revenue from just two customers, Microsoft accounting for 62% Circle (June 2025): – Stock shot up 500% after debut – Raised $1.05 billion 1. True SaaS Economics at Scale Unlike the capital-intensive, low-margin businesses of 2020’s sharing economy giants, Figma demonstrates classic SaaS metrics that VCs dream about: – 91% gross margins (compared to traditional cloud infrastructure plays) – Subscription-based recurring revenue model – Expanding user base beyond core design market 2. Profitability Without Sacrificing Growth Figma generated net income in Q1 2025 while maintaining 46% YoY growth – something that eluded most 2020 IPO darlings. This proves the SaaS model’s inherent scalability when executed correctly. 3. Market Timing and Positioning Figma could serve as a bellwether for the market, providing proof-of-concept for other SaaS names like Canva, Netskope, and Databricks. The company went public at the perfect inflection point of IPO market recovery. 4. Platform Expansion Strategy Only one-third of Figma’s 13 million monthly users are designers, demonstrating successful expansion beyond initial TAM – a key growth vector that wasn’t present in most 2020 IPOs. 2021 saw a record 1,035 IPOs, with 155 U.S. venture-backed IPOs raising $60.4 billion. Three of the 10 biggest tech IPOs ever happened in 2020, with companies commanding valuations “seemingly untethered from any analytic metrics”. The IPO market essentially froze after 2021, with only 13 such offerings in 2022, 18 in 2023, and 30 in 2024, collectively raising just $13.3 billion. 201 IPOs so far in 2025, with IPO issuance estimated to range from 155 to 195 deals. June 2025 produced five tech IPOs, accelerating from a monthly average of two since January. Based on Figma’s template, the next wave of successful tech IPOs will likely include: – Canva ($32 billion valuation, $2.6 billion revenue, seven consecutive years of profitability) – Databricks (60% revenue growth, 140%+ net revenue retention) – Klarna ($2.8 billion revenue, returning to profitability) After Figma’s Massive IPO, Could Canva IPO at $200 Billion+? Figma’s IPO success isn’t just about market timing – it’s about building an incredibly sound SaaS business that grows efficiently, expands its market, and generates sustainable profits. In a market that’s both infatuated with AI but also becoming increasingly discerning at scale after the 2020-2021 excesses, Figma proves that great SaaS companies can still command premium valuations and deliver explosive public market debuts. SaaS isn’t dead. In fact, it’s bigger than ever. With its best IPO to date, so far. For founders building the next generation of SaaS companies, Figma’s path from design tool to connected platform to profitable public company offers the clearest roadmap to IPO success in today’s market environment. The bottom line: Figma didn’t just go public – it set the new standard for how exceptional SaaS companies should approach public markets in 2025 and beyond.

Title: The Day MOOCs Died: Coursera's Preview Mode Kills Free Learning

Learn without limits* (*some limits, like seeing the actual course, may apply). Last week, Coursera’s new CEO, Greg Hart, delivered something the company’s investors had been eagerly awaiting: growth. In his first full quarter as CEO, Greg’s leadership helped drive Coursera’s stock price up 36% following the earnings call, pushing the company’s valuation past the $2 billion mark. However, this pursuit of prioritizing Wall Street could come at a cost to learners worldwide. The company is rolling out a “Preview Mode,” a feature that would lock almost all course content, including video lectures. Coursera formally launched in January 2012 with the mission statement: “We are committed to making the best education in the world freely available to any person who seeks it.” At that time, Coursera had no business model. Over the years, Coursera gradually introduced monetization features, including certificates, specializations, and subscription plans, while placing certificates and graded assignments behind paywalls. This transition is detailed in my article, Coursera’s Monetization Journey: From Zero to IPO. During the Jeff Maggioncalda era (June 2017 to early 2025), Coursera maintained a relatively stable free auditing policy. Under his leadership, learners retained access to video content for most courses, even as certificates and graded assignments required payment. While competitors like edX and FutureLearn implemented time-based paywalls, restricting all course content, Coursera largely resisted this approach, keeping video lectures accessible to non-paying users. That appears to be changing under new leadership. In early July, while attempting to enroll in Programming Languages I from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, I encountered a significant change: the course was completely locked, with only Module 1 accessible. When I consulted with my Classmates (that’s what we call each other at Class Central), they reported full access to the same course, minus the graded assignments. This inconsistency suggested that Preview Mode was in limited testing. I reached out to my network familiar with this matter and confirmed that Preview Mode is real and will be deployed across the platform. What remains unclear is the extent of this deployment. What percentage of courses will be affected? Will universities have the option to opt out? Will it be limited to certain geographic regions? Class Central will be closely monitoring these developments. Courses that have offered free video access for years, some for over a decade, may soon become restricted. This represents a fundamental shift from a model that had been stable for years. I dread to think of all the places and different articles we published on Class Central that need to be updated. After failing to boost the stock price through layoffs and stock buybacks, Coursera replaced its long-time CEO with Amazon veteran Greg Hart. In Hart’s first full quarter as CEO, he raised Coursera’s 2025 revenue outlook by $17 million, projecting a range of $738 million to $746 million. During the earnings call, CFO Ken Hahn attributed the current quarter’s growth to “strong receptivity to our Coursera Plus subscription offerings and marketing campaigns, including localized promotions and pricing that benefited our paid conversion rate.” This likely translates to increased discounting (a recent Coursera trend) and geographic pricing adjustments that reduce costs in countries with lower purchasing power. While this represents only a 2% increase in annual revenue, Wall Street responded dramatically: Coursera’s stock price surged 36%. In other words, a modest 2% revenue boost made Coursera’s investors and employees half a billion dollars richer overnight. Hart indicated the additional $17 million will come from the consumer business, which he described as having “a more responsive model.” This suggests Coursera can adjust pricing strategies more aggressively to maximize revenue, and the upcoming Preview Mode rollout is part of this approach. Previously when MOOC providers implemented paywalls, it was done in the guise of sustainability. Yet Coursera’s financials tell a different story. The company has never been stronger financially, generating $29 million in free cash flow last quarter alone while maintaining $775 million in cash reserves. This move appears to be designed primarily to boost a stock price that, despite the recent surge, remains 73% below its IPO level. In many ways, yes. Major platforms stopped using the term “MOOC” to describe their courses years ago. The term had been fading, a decline accelerated by 2U’s acquisition of edX and subsequent bankruptcy. FutureLearn’s acquisition by Global University Systems further consolidated the market. This left Coursera as the last major independent player — the largest platform and the one with the most generous free access policy. MOOCs never achieved the transformative potential promised during the early hype. The movement lost its way as monetization increasingly took precedence over accessibility. When I built Class Central as a side project over Thanksgiving weekend in 2011, my goal was simply to track free online courses from Stanford. Throughout the years, I believed Coursera had preserved some of the original MOOC spirit by maintaining free access to course content. With Preview Mode’s implementation, that spirit finally dies. MOOCs, as originally conceived, are now truly dead. About Class Central In a world where late capitalism is been overturned by techno feudalism, is not a surprise that MOOC – Coursera’s Preview Mode Kills the Free Learning!! We are the serfs that have to pay for everything for simply existing, any change that we could have to accumulate knowledge, capital or influence will be restrained by the rentier’s Lords of the Clouds/internet. Last attempt to post my comment: This was forseeable after Coursera announced their new CEO. Greg Hart was a sales person at Amazon, and for a sales person is money the first and the only thing which is important. Coursera decided to go the edX and FutureLearn way, and shift to a shareholder value policy. It will be interesting what Coursera´s University partners think about these steps, and what are their next steps regarding the partnership. In general i agree with your view Dhawal, the MOOCS as they invented are dead, forever. Cancel Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.

Title: How To Collect Dividends Up To 11% From Tech Stocks

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Nasdaq has been rallying nonstop since April. Let’s discuss three covered call fund payouts up to 11.2% that play the rally. The catalyst is the “rise of the machines” with companies replacing expensive humans with cheaper robots and AI tools. Hiring numbers are down and (paradoxically to some) the Nasdaq continues to levitate higher. This summer heater in tech stocks is no surprise to us contrarians. The Naz tech giants are enjoying expanding profit margins! Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy recently admitted the company’s workforce will shrink, replaced by AI. This is bad for those who work at Amazon, but great for those who own AMZN. Microsoft (MSFT) also announced big layoffs in recent months, especially in sales and support roles easily handled by AI-driven tools. And my friends at Alphabet (GOOG) are looking over their shoulders wondering how much longer their services will be needed. This is a dicey time to be a rank-and-file tech bro—but an exciting time to be a tech savvy dividend investor. Here are three “one-click” (or one-tap) dividend plays on this megatrend! Alphabet (GOOG) will never pay 11.2%. But we can buy GOOG and the rest of Big Tech for 11.2% payouts via a fund like Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which sells (“writes”) covered call funds on the Naz index itself to generate additional income. QYLD buys the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 and simultaneously writes covered calls on the index itself to generate income—which it pays out monthly. It’s not perfect exposure to technology. The Nasdaq-100 is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, and in fact, it includes stocks from 10 different sectors. However, it’s still tech-heavy, at 60% of the index’s weight, and includes trillion-dollar tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), so it’s generally treated as a proxy for the sector. But that’s a marginal consideration. The real tradeoff to weigh is tactical. By selling covered calls against the Nasdaq, we’re sacrificing potential upside in return for a.) much more stability and b.) the very high income from the options premiums it collects. QYLD will rarely outperform the “QQQs” to the upside. But it also has less downside exposure, thanks to the constant income it generates by selling the call options. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income (JEPQ) uses a similar strategy, owning roughly 100 or so Nasdaq stocks while selling calls against the Nasdaq-100. It also doles out its massive dividend in monthly distributions. But it’s a little more flexible because of a big difference between it and QYLD: management. Whereas QYLD tracks an index and typically has only one options position at any given moment, JEPQ is led by 38-year veteran Hamilton Reiner and a team of four co-managers who can sell multiple contracts. I’ve also pointed out in the past that while both funds hold pretty much the same stocks, JEPQ is more heavily weighted in mega-cap names than QYLD. But that’s not by definition. Indeed, today, JEPQ has a smaller percentage of assets invested in each of its top 10 holdings than QYLD. These might not seem like meaningful differences, but over time we see that JPMorgan’s “homemade” strategy beat QYLD’s straightforward approach. Active management can make a world of difference—so much so that I typically prefer closed-end funds (CEFs) over comparable ETFs. Let’s walk over to the CEF side of the border to review our final call writer. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is a CEF, while QYLD and JEPQ are ETFs. But the differences go far beyond fund type. Paul Wick, who has nearly four decades of experience, and a team of five other managers run a slimmer portfolio of about 55 holdings. The portfolio is also a purer—though not pure—play on technology, with about 70% of assets dedicated to the sector. STK also is interested in “growth at a reasonable price” (GARP); a relatively more value-priced portfolio shows it, with price-to-earnings, sales, book, and cash flow all lower than the other ETFs. And whereas QYLD tries to own Nasdaq-100 stocks (and while JEPQ has a broader mandate but looks index-esque in its larger holdings), STK is much more willing to take some shots—stocks such as Lam Research (LRCX) and industrial Bloom Energy (BE) punch well above their weight. Columbia Seligman’s CEF writes covered calls, too—typically on the Nasdaq-100, but again, it has more flexibility. For instance, right now, management is selling Apple calls, too. The strategy works. In fact, it works mighty well. STK still has its drawbacks. Unlike other covered-call funds, Columbia Seligman’s fund is actually more volatile than the Nasdaq, not less. Moreover, while the ETFs pay monthly, this CEF is only paying us on a quarterly schedule—and at current prices (which admittedly represent a slight discount to net asset value), it’s paying us just half as much as JEPQ and QYLD.

Title: Big Tech has cut over 100,000 jobs this year — and the AI revolution is just getting started

Since the start of the year, Big Tech has shed over 100,000 jobs. Sure, some of these layoffs are just standard corporate belt tightening, but it is now clear that AI is impacting the job market — and entry- and mid-level workers are being hit the hardest. This underscores a defining question of our time: Will AI lead to widespread unemployment, or will it create new opportunities and industries that we can’t yet imagine? So far, AI is displacing jobs faster than new ones are being created. The displacement of workers through automation is nothing new. Emerging technologies upend legacy companies and industries, and usher in new organizations with better jobs with higher pay. It’s a cycle that’s been dubbed “creative destruction” by economist Joseph Schumpeter. Throughout history, that has meant short-term pain for long-term gain — at least for some. On the one hand, the automobile put farriers and stage-coach drivers out of business but created millions of good-paying jobs for automotive assembly workers and truck drivers. On the other, the internet replaced many department-store clerks, travel agents, taxi drivers and journalists with Amazon fulfillment center workers, Uber drivers, content creators and others who often work more hours for less pay with fewer benefits. And in the Rust Belt and factory towns, automation has eliminated countless workers with no obvious replacement in sight. The disruption from AI could make this look like kids’ stuff. Historically, technology has automated workers at the periphery — those with low skills that can easily be substituted. AI will automate everything, everywhere, all at once, displacing knowledge workers and managers in every industry. Ironically, tradespeople like welders, electricians, plumbers and carpenters who were told “learn to code” may be the last to get automated away. Already, engineers at Amazon are complaining that their role has been degraded as they’re asked to do more with AI. There is an added concern that AI will kill many careers before they begin. In a recent interview with Axios, Dario Amodei, CEO of AI darling Anthropic, said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. A LinkedIn executive echoed this sentiment in a recent New York Times essay with the alarming title “The bottom rung of the career ladder is breaking,” citing at-risk entry-level jobs such as paralegals and call center operators. Tech CEOs seem unfussed by the potential of a looming cataclysm — if anything, they’re doing what they can to usher it in. Mark Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan this year that AI will replace most of Meta’s mid-level engineers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that AI already writes 30% of the company’s code. In the last few months, Microsoft has fired more than 15,000 people. Shareholders are rewarding executives that adopt AI and slash headcount: Microsoft’s stock just hit an all time high. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. As he’s musing about mass cuts to his workforce to Rogan, Zuckerberg is also poaching the top AI minds from competitors like OpenAI and Apple with eye-popping pay packages. Ruoming Pang was lured away from Apple with an offer worth $200 million — triple what Apple CEO Tim Cook made last year. Is AI exposing yet another fault line between haves and have-nots? Is this a harbinger of what we can come to expect from an AI economy? So far AI has created huge wealth for founders, investors and the top 0.01% of tech talent. But what about the rest of us? This goes beyond business with implications for governments and society. President Trump initially rose to popularity by tapping into the anger and fears of an aging blue-collar work force who felt left behind by globalization and automation. He sustained his appeal by broadening his coalition to include a more diverse and younger part of the electorate, namely Gen Z men, who are among the most at-risk groups when it comes to being replaced by AI. An economy where young people can’t find work could deepen Gen Z’s economic pessimism into existential nihilism. New technologies are always greeted with a mixture of hope, trepidation and outright pessimism. Ultimately, technology has no agency. It is not morally good or bad. It is a tool, created and wielded by people. Human beings learned to make fire, and cook food, stay warm and clear land for agriculture — or burn down a rival’s hut.

Title: Mag 7 Plans to 'FOMO' Into $650B Tech Investment Despite Trump's U.S. Manufacturing Push

While President Donald Trump's tariff war aims to spark a manufacturing boom at home, corporate America's spending focus remains firmly on "bits" rather than "bricks and mortar." This contrast is evident in the spending patterns of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks – a group comprising large-cap tech companies, including Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (parent company of Facebook and Instagram), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These firms are expected to cumulatively spend an astonishing $650 billion this year on capital expenditure (capex) and research and development (R&D), according to data tracked by Lloyds Bank. That amount is larger than what the U.K. government spends on public investments in a year, the bank noted in a Thursday note. If that number alone doesn't impress you, consider this: the total economy-wide investment spending on IT equipment and software has continued to surge this year, accounting for 6.1% of GDP, while both private fixed and fixed non-residential investment, excluding IT, have shrunk for consecutive quarters. According to Lloyds' FX Strategist Nicholas Kennedy, the decline in investments across other sectors of the economy could be due to several reasons, including the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. "There might be some explanations other than a crowding out by IT spending and political/trade uncertainties that you could call on; the building boom that was triggered by Biden's CHIPS act, which boosted structures, has faded, for instance. There is also a FOMO effect at work, firms encouraged to divert investment resources from what they traditionally do towards fashionable AI-related projects. So they're just spending elsewhere," Kennedy said in a note to clients. The chart indicates that U.S. corporate spending on IT equipment and software has increased to $1.45 trillion, representing a 13.6% year-over-year rise. The tally makes up over 40% of the total U.S. private fixed investment. The U.S. second-quarter GDP estimate, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis early this week, showed that private fixed investment in IT increased by 12.4% quarter-on-quarter. Meanwhile, investment in non-IT sectors or the broader economy fell by 4.9%, extending the three-quarter declining trend. This continued dominance of "bits" spending in corporate America should calm the nerves of those worried that the administration's focus on manufacturing may suck capital away from technology markets, including emerging avenues like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and NVDA, the bellwether for all things AI, both bottomed out in late November 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT and have since enjoyed incredible bull runs, demonstrating a powerful correlation between technology's rise and the crypto market. "Whether that [AI spending boom] generates a return is another matter, but it does reshape plans towards bits from bricks," Kennedy said. Moreover, the crypto market has also found a significant tailwind in the form of a favourable regulatory policy under Trump. The administration has demonstrated its pro-crypto bias through the signing of several key pieces of legislation aimed at clarifying regulatory oversight for digital assets and stablecoins, including measures that have garnered bipartisan support. Additionally, the administration has made strategic appointments to financial regulatory bodies. Omkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor and analyst on CoinDesk's Markets team.

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Amazon's stock dropped 8.3% as AWS's growth significantly lagged rivals like Azure and Google Cloud, disappointing investors despite strong retail sales.AWS's slower growth stems from its lack of integrated proprietary AI models and a strategy requiring high technical expertise, hindering adoption in the generative AI age.Analysts express skepticism regarding Amazon's ability to compete effectively in AI, citing CEO Jassy's unconvincing explanations and AWS's strategic shortcomings. Amazon stock fell 8.3% in after-hours trading on Thursday following a mixed second quarter report, according to CNBC. Why? Although Amazon’s retail business performed well, investors expressed disappointment with the growth pace of Amazon Web Services – which grew more slowly than Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Analysts were left wanting more from CEO Andy Jassy’s explanations during the conference call for AWS’s relatively slow growth. Amazon’s fundamental problem is its failure to adapt to the competitive imperatives of the generative AI age, noted my book Brain Rush. This age has been propelled by two companies – OpenAI which supplied the fast-growing ChatGPT and Nvidia, the designer of AI chips for speeding the training and operation of AI chatbots. Amazon seems to be applying the strategy it used to pioneer the cloud services industry to the AI cloud market – where it is struggling to catch up. More specifically, unlike Microsoft and Google – which have access to proprietary integrated AI chatbots (ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively) – AWS’s strategy of handing off to developers the task of choosing and integrating individual computing services requires more technical expertise – thereby slowing adoption. To grow faster, Jassey ought to consider three possible strategies: Since Jassy helped build AWS and has yet to demonstrate a compelling vision for competing with faster growing rivals, I am skeptical of whether Amazon will be able to leapfrog these rivals. “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out," Jassy said in an earnings release. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” he added. I have requested comment from Amazon and will update this post if I receive a response. Amazon’s second quarter results blended above expectations sales and earnings with a mixed forecast for the future and a shaky explanation for why AWS is growing more slowly in the age of AI. Here are the key numbers: Amazon and its hyperscaler rivals – such as Google and Meta – are increasing their capital expenditures. For example, Amazon is boosting capital expenditures 42% to $118 billion in 2025, Google’s will reach $85 billion and Meta forecast $69 billion in 2025 capex, according to CNBC. Investors are using growth rates as a proxy for the return on AI investments. Since AWS is growing at roughly half the rate of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, investors see a problem with AWS’s strategy. Jassy’s responses to analyst questions about AWS’ relatively slow growth did not directly address the question. He said the faster-growing second ranked rival was “65%” the size of AWS, highlighted Microsoft’s security woes – notably the hacking of SharePoint, and suggested it was “early days” in AI, according to the Q2 earnings conference call transcript. These comments did not offer a compelling explanation of why Amazon – with 30% market share to Microsoft Azure’s 20%, according to Synergy Group -- is growing about half the rate of challengers. Since Jassy sidestepped the question, here are two reasons I think AWS is growing more slowly than rivals: Here are three strategies Amazon must pursue to grow faster than its cloud services rivals: These recommendations may be difficult to implement and may not result in new services that deliver more value to customers than those from faster-growing rivals. That’s partly because they are at odds with Amazon’s culture. For example, Amazon believes in inventing and improving its own solutions – as it did with AWS and Alexa. Therefore the recommended partnerships may be at odds with the company’s culture. Moreover, as former CEO of AWS, Jassy may have strategic blind spots. These could include viewing AI as primarily an infrastructure challenge that Amazon can solve with superior engineering. Jassy may also be dismissing the more rapid growth of rivals as superficial, as he did during the investor conference call, rather than a sign customers value AI cloud services from Microsoft and Google more highly. Is Amazon stock – which has lost 2.4% of its value so far in 2025 – trading at a bargain price? Some analysts sound skeptical: Despite this skepticism, analysts see Amazon stock as slightly undervalued. Of the 52 analysts who cover Amazon, the stock has 9.2% upside based on an average price target of $255.72, according to Zacks. Unless AWS’ revenue growth and operating profit accelerate, that modest gain could prove difficult to achieve.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings: Magnificent 7 Outperform Growth Expectations

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. This week is the second busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 124 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Pfizer (PFE), Yum! Brands (YUM), McDonald’s (MCD), Caterpillar (CVX), and Walt Disney (DIS). The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) released better-than-expected earnings on Saturday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks. All the details about Berkshire’s quarterly earnings are here. According to FactSet, 82% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 66% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 10.3% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.9%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.8%. Despite the better earnings results, the S&P 500 retreated from all-time highs last week, with jobs, increased tariffs, and escalating tension with Russia weighing on the index. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to blowout earnings from Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) reported robust earnings growth, which also continued to reinforce the artificial intelligence earnings narrative. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) also beat consensus estimates by a healthy margin with their earnings reports, but both stocks traded lower last week on concerns about the outlook. NVIDIA (NVDA) is the last of the Magnificent 7 to report results, scheduled for August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the healthcare, consumer discretionary, and technology sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. While the first-quarter headline GDP understated the underlying trend of the US economy, the second-quarter headline GDP number overstates the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they slowed to a 1.2% pace after the 1.9% growth in the first quarter. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the US private sector. Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by a below-consensus 73,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. There was a shockingly significant downward revision in payroll jobs over the previous months, chopping off 258,000 jobs from what was previously reported. Downward revisions, especially of this magnitude, are a sign that the labor market is cooling. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The deterioration in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market is softening. While one should not jump to conclusions after one ugly month, it should be monitored closely for a continuation of the downtrend. The weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits have deteriorated slightly, indicating that the unemployed are having a harder time finding another job. Still, it has been a slow leak rather than a collapse so far. It is the second busiest week of earnings season, before earnings reports slow markedly next week. The shockingly soft monthly jobs report on Friday sent the odds of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) soaring. Markets are currently pricing in an 87% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. There aren’t any top-tier economic releases next week, but Fedspeak will be monitored closely for any reaction to the monthly payroll report. Last week, President Trump announced new reciprocal tariff rates for countries not yet reaching a trade deal with the US. Generally, these new tariff rates become effective on August 7. News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. More sectoral tariffs could also be forthcoming. After hitting an all-time high last Monday, stocks retreated in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report, increased tariffs, and escalating geopolitical tension with Russia. Stocks had been boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. While the earnings story continues, particularly in the AI-related technology space, an increase in the odds of recession weighed on risk appetite.

McDonald’s and Walt Disney are among the leading consumer companies on the calendar. Several noteworthy drugmakers are also scheduled to post earnings, including Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Pfizer, and Eli Lilly. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariffs are remaking the landscape of international trade, while factory orders could help show whether tariffs are helping spur a rise in domestic manufacturing so far. Trade weighed heavily on stocks to close out last week, with concerns about tariffs and the health of the job market pulling all three major indexes into the red after a generally strong July. Consumer credit data later in the week will provide insight into how much Americans are spending. Market watchers will also be following comments from Federal Reserve officials after last week’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged.

Analysts are also high on Uber Technologies (UBER) ahead of its scheduled report on Wednesday. McDonald’s (MCD) reportm on tap for Wednesday, is due as the burger chain has reported that traffic from middle-income households was down amid lagging consumer confidence. Disney’s (DIS) scheduled report on the same day follows the entertainment giant lifting its full-year profit outlook in the prior quarter amid subscriber growth in its streaming services.

Eli Lilly’s (LLY) report set for Thursday follows cuts to its profit outlook in May against the backdrop of high research and development costs. U.S. trade deficit data, due Tuesday, will provide market watchers with more insight into how President Donald Trump’s tariff policies are affecting international trade. The data comes as the gap between imports and exports is narrowing as the tariffs take hold. Areport on second-quarter productivity comes as market watchers look for the impact of AI on the workforce. Updated consumer credit data will be released as economists closely watch the health of the U.S. consumer. Meanwhile, investors will also be alert to weekly jobless claims on Thursday following last week’s employment report. After two members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted last week to cut interest rates, investors will be tracking public comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem for more insight into what's next for the central bank.

The move sparked debate, with some industry observers interpreting it as fallout from artificial intelligence (AI), and warning of similar cuts at other major firms. However, TCS chief executive K. Krithivasan attributed the decision to skill mismatches, not AI. Days later, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said his company remained committed to hiring 20,000 freshers in FY26. The contrasting statements suggested that the layoffs were likely tied to TCS’s internal restructuring rather than indicative of an industry-wide trend. Still, the sector hasn’t resolved the structural challenges that have built up over the past few years. Investor confidence in IT stocks has eroded significantly from a year ago. While major companies have delivered strong returns over five years, their stock prices have declined over the past year—falling further in 2025 and trailing the BSE Sensex’s modest 3% year-to-date gain. Much of the market pessimism stems from softening demand in key Western markets, where clients are tightening budgets while AI capabilities expand. This has forced the industry to focus heavily on cost-cutting and efficiency improvements. Major IT players have dramatically reduced their workforce—TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra together employ 56,000 fewer people now than they did two years ago. Western pressuresSome of this drive comes from the sector’s peers in the West. A worldwide efficiency push has driven massive tech layoffs. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech companies eliminated over 80,000 positions in the first half of 2025 alone, following 152,000 cuts in 2024 and 264,000 in 2023. This restructuring wave, spearheaded by industry giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, has established new investor benchmarks for operational efficiency across the sector. But Indian IT services companies face a different challenge. They can't simply slash costs as product companies do, since revenue depends on billable hours. At the same time, their enterprise clients are reportedly demanding 20-30% price cuts, citing expected AI-driven productivity. Also Read | Three years on, AI is prompting IT companies to cut workforce The reality is more tempered. Parekh, for instance, recently told the Times of India that AI and automation are currently yielding productivity gains of only 5–15%. This mismatch between client expectations and actual impact is prompting firms to seek savings elsewhere. Client squeezePart of the efficiency drive is also rooted in sluggish demand. On TCS’s latest earnings call, Krithivasan observed that decision-making delays and project deferrals for discretionary investments had persisted and worsened through the June quarter. Workforce reductions over the past two years have enabled TCS and other tier-I firms to sustain or enhance revenue per employee, a critical performance metric for these companies. While leading IT services companies have stagnated, growth has been driven by global capability centres (the in-house tech hubs of multinational companies) and smaller players. GCC revenues expanded by 40% in FY24 alone. Nasscom projected earlier this year that revenues of GCCs in FY25 would roughly match IT service exports, with the total industry headcount growing by 126,000 to reach 5.8 million in FY25, up from 5.58 million in FY23. Efficiency driveIn effect, IT services majors that once powered the sector’s employment boom are now prioritizing profitability over headcount growth. Margins across leading firms have come under pressure, as pricing constraints and intensifying competition weigh on the sector. TCS, which has consistently reported the highest margins among peers, also made the boldest restructuring move—underscoring how central efficiency will be in the years ahead.

In a market where demand may return but pricing remains tight, efficiency will be key to success. And as the industry transitions to output-based pricing, the most efficient firms will capture the biggest gains. But the impact goes beyond margins. The layoffs have triggered legal and social pushback. Karnataka’s IT employees’ union has filed an industrial dispute against TCS, alleging illegal retrenchment. The episode has also reignited long-standing debates around CEO compensation and employee protections in India’s tech sector. However, there are implications beyond financial metrics.
